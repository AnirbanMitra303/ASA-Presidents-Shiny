Wright","1908-1939","at the meeting of this association in april last it was decided that at this meeting, and perhaps at successive annual meetings, there should be a presidential address, and the present one is the first of that character. it is appropriate, therefore, that i should indulge in a brief historical statement concerning the origin and work of the association. the royal statistical society of london was founded march 15, 1834, but was not incorporated until jan. 31, 1887. whether the founding of the royal society inspired the organization of this association i cannot say, but it is safe to assume that this was the case, for it was only a brief period after the organization of the british institution that a meeting was held at the rooms of the education society, 15 cornhill, boston, nov. 27, 1839, for the purpose of considering the expediency of forming a statistical society. after discussing the objects for which the meeting was called, it was resolved that it was expedient to form a society to be called the american statistical society. a committee was appointed to prepare a constitution for the government of the society, to be submitted at an adjourned meeting, and all the gentlemen present were made members of that committee. dec. 11, 1839, all the gentlemen previously named being present except mr. fletcher, a constitution of the statistical society was adopted. the object of the society was stated to be to collect, preserve, and diffuse statistical information in the different departments of human knowledge. after deliberation and discussion it was voted to adopt the constitution, and an adjournment was made until when all the gentlemen named were present. at this meeting the organization was perfected by the choice of officers. at the next meeting, there appeared the name of dr. webb. it was voted that an application be made to the legislature for an act of incorporation. the occasion of the annual meeting of the association, the formation, progress, and purpose of the society and the public good it might do, if suitably conducted, was discussed by the president. at this meeting it was voted on motion of the directors and i think we can discover the humor underlying this vote that the name of the society be altered from that of the american statistical society to that of the american statistical association. officers were elected at this annual meeting, and the individual members were proposed as fellows, honorary, correspontling, and foreign members. by an act approved the american statistical association was incorporated by the legislature of massachusetts. thus the new association, full fledged and authorized by law, was ready for its work of preserving and diffusing statistical information. it has always adhered to this provision of the act incorporating it. it has not gone into economic or social questions, philosophical or ethical science, but has adhered most rigidly to its statistical objectives. up to date it has had a continued existence, having been a year since its organization that it has not held meetings and had papers of a statistical character, although its proceedings have not been regularly printed. it has had during the whole period of its existence of sixty nine years but five presidents. dr. jarvis served the association thirty years as its president., and on the election of his successor, dr. walker, he was made president emeritus. with two exceptions three quarterly meetings, besides the annual meeting, each year were held from 1840 to 1879. some of the meetings were omitted in some of the years, especially the july meeting, which, beginning in 1881, was omitted regularly. from 1894 on no quarterly meetings were held, with the exception of a special quarterly meeting on april 16, 1897, in memory of president walker. since 1899 until the present year no quarterly meetings have been held, but there has been no year in which meetings have been entirely omitted. the proceedings of the society have not been published regularly. the collections of the association were brought together and printed. in the first part there appears quite a valuable paper by professor edwards, of the andover theological seminary. professor edwards discussed the history and origin of statistics. there were other papers on the towns of massachusetts in this first part, with a history of their origin. part two contained statistics of population in massachusetts, prepared by rev. joseph b. felt, while part three, published in 1847, contains statistics of taxation in massachusetts, including valuation and population. this was also prepared by mr. felt, and was one of the first attempts at analysis of statistics by a member of the association. so far as i have been able to learn papers in a desultory way were published from time to time, but no regular collection appeared until what we now know as the new series, beginning in march, 1888, under the direction of dr. davis r. dewey, and when general walker was president of the association. since then the publications have appeared regularly, and they constitute a collection of exceedingly valuable statistical productions. in fact, i feel warranted in asserting that no statistical society has, on the whole, brought out a more valuable collection of statistical material, and the members of the association can feel gratified that it has presented to the public so many carefully analyzed topics relating to the science to which we are devoted. with this brief historical review, it is pertinent to discuss the field of labor of the association, the condition of public statistics when it was organized, and the opportunity it has had for exerting its influence and for conducting its statistical in vestigations. the scope of statistical inquiry when the association was organized was not only very liiited in quantity, but meagre and unsatisfactory in quality. the vehicle of statistical informa tion, the federal census, had not reached encyclopedic proportions. the association had as its field from which to draw the facts for its analysis the united states census from, the colonial censuses, and those of one or two states, more especially the efforts of the commonwealth of massachusetts. a glance at the founders of our association convinces one immediately that they were men who understood and comprehended both analysis and classification ; that the analysis and classification of the facts relating to various conditions which surround the human race entered into their great object, and the purpose of social science at large, the chief object of which is to spread the knowledge resulting from the investigations of its movements, that the people may better appreciate and understand their own conditions and aid, by an increased intelligence, in the amelioration of unfavorable features and the eradication of positive evils. they knew as well as social scientists and statisticians today that statistical methods or statistical science, if you prefer could evolve laws which should be applied practically to these great objects of social science. they felt that the time had arrived when something should be done outside the mere collection of data. they had an opportunity with the meagre efforts back of them for this purpose. the united states instituted the national census in. there are three periods to the census, the colonial, the continental, and the constitutional, or our present period. during the first period the british board of trade played an important part in affairs, and it often at tempted enumerations of the people of the colonies, but the census had not then assumed scientific form and definiteness in europe, and, as would be expected, the results here were very imperfect. superstition was an obstacle, but without obstacle success could not have been attained in the colonies when the mother country took her first census in, and then so imperfectly that the results were of no immediate value. during the continental period, although resolutions in congress had been introduced, no general enumeration of the population was secured. various estimates and computations were made from time to time, but they came no nearer accuracy than those made in the colonial period. it had, however, become clearly settled that there never could be a complete enumeration until the work was done by a central directing authority. it was left to the constitution to give us first an enumeration of population and afterwards a national census, primarily for the purpose of apportioning representatives and direct taxes among the several states included within the union and accord ing to their respective numbers. this attitude of congress caused an enumeration of the population in 1790, and from this has grown the national census. perhaps the most impressive statement relative to this growth relates to number of inquiries at the first and at later at the census of there was one schedule, containing four inquiries. when the statistical association had just been organized, there were two schedules, containing inquiries or details. just one hundred years after the first census, there were schedules, containing inquiries or details. in the 4 queries related to the members of the family, the people only, while in 1890 the inquiries did not apply to one individual, but they were all projected. this was the grand sweep of one hundred years. in an attempt was made to collect data relative to manufactures. this was repeated in , omitted in , and taken up again in , and has continued through all censuses since that time, but until 1850 the inquiries as to manufactures amounted to but little. a start was made in agricultural statistics in 1840, and the work has been continued throughout. there were colonial censuses in the colony of massachusetts in. state censuses were ordered in the regular decennial enumeration of the inhabitants under state authorization was ordered taken in 1855 in connection with the collection of industrial statistics, and this has been taken since then, being the mean between the dates of the federal census. thus massachusetts has a census every five years, both of population and of industry. some other states organized a census on the period relative to the united states census, but, like the earlier state censuses of massachusetts, they were of very little value. securing the aggregate population for the purpose of legislative representation. the crudeness of these earlier censuses seems very strange to us, and yet they were creditable efforts on the part of the state governments authorizing the collection and showed a disposition to secure information on which to base conclusions and actions. the first analytical survey of any of these works, so far as my observation warrants the statement, was by the first secretary of this association, in a report to a committee of the city council appointed to obtain the census of boston for the year 1845. mr. shattuck, who drew this report for the committee, indulged in some very sharp criticisms of the federal census, and analyzed in a very creditable way the results of that particular census. some of the members of the association and i regret that i have not been able to find the documents dealt with the state censuses from time to time, and others, especially had much to do with inducing the federal government to expand its work, and in 1870 he analyzed some of the statistics of the federal census. i do not know whether any of you ever knew , but i knew him well, not only through my association with him in this organization, but by his frequent visits to my office to discuss statistical questions. he was very fond of relating some of the amusing things he found in the federal census. on one occasion he found the case of a man something over eighty years of age who had died of teething, and a child a few months old who had died of old age. of course there was a transposition in the statements, but it amused the old doctor immensely and he never tired of relating the anecdote. the first census, as i have said, which really amounted to an attempt at scientific work was the federal census of 1850. it was better in some respects than the succeeding one of 1860. in 1870 general walker was put in charge, and the census of that year was an enormous improvement over that of 1550; but it was just prior to 1880 that general walker submitted to congress a bill providing for the tenth census, and it was through an extension of inquiries of far reaching importance that the census of 1880 became known as the encyclopedic census of the united states. it attracted the attention of the leading statisticians all over europe and gave the united states a position in statistical work that it had never held before. it should be remembered that the united states was then the only government collecting industrial statistics of any kind that is the products of agriculture and manufactures and it is today the only state in the world that does this character of work. we hear of industrial censuses in europe, but they relate only to occupations, although some attempt has been made to secure statistics similar to those collected here. while the british parliament rejected time and time again a bill relating to statistics of production, as it was feared that much trouble would ensue, yet last year a law wm passed for a decennial census of english manufactures, and the work is now in progress. the united states is therefore the leading country. its population schedule embraces many more inquiries than that of any other census office, and it expands its work to cover all conceivable valuable data. the first state censuses to command any attention and which can, by any stretch of terms, be considered as scientific, were those of new york and massachusetts in 1875. the new york census of that year was a most excellent one. the census of massachusetts i do not feel at liberty to speak of extensively, but in bulk, anyhow, it surpassed any of the state’s previous publications. a small volume had contained the results of previous censuses. the association had at its start, as i have said, a very narrow field from which to gather its material. we did not have our fine registration reports, nothing on agriculture, nothing on insurance, nothing on savings banks, nothing except the meagre census reports to which i have alluded. mr. felt in his paper to which i have referred, and which was delivered before the association in 1843, gave a brief ac count of what was being done at that time in foreign countries. he speaks of the royal statistical society as having been , founded in 1834 in pursuance of a recommendation of the british association for the advancement of science. but it could not deal with the great questions which belonged to it. it had little or no information on which to base its conclusions. in fact, i have wondered many times how writers back of 18.50 at least could bring out their positive deductions, as adam smith, for instance, when he wrote his “wealth of nations,’’ seems to have had a vast amount of information, but where he got it is difficult to say. the royal society under took to meet this great want. it appointed committees for the purpose of procuring and collecting information in respect to various strikes and combinations which existed for the purpose of altering the rate of wages. and it had a committee whose sole duty was to perfect the statistics of life, relating to births, deaths, marriages, and population. mr. felt says that “in the united states but little attention has as yet been given to the subject of statistics, that the attempt has never been made to present a complete view of either of the great departments of this interesting and practical science.” he refers to the meagre attempts of the patent office and to some of the individual states, the reports of the school commissioners of new york and massachusetts, and to a few isolated individuals who have labored in the statistical field with great assiduity. they had to fall back largely on information contained in and he goes on to say that “it is in this interesting and comparatively uncultivated fieid that the statistical association propose to labor with such means as may be placed at their disposal, with the co operation of kindred societies which may be formed, and with the aid which may be expected from our national and state governments. it is obviously a field of vast extent, and rich in materials for collection and com parison.” and yet we see how meagre the field was; how rich it is to day in comparison with what it was when our association was organized. but the field has been enriched in various lines other than census taking. while the census offers the greatest field for exploitation by associations like our own, there are other fields now that were not contemplated by the organizers of this institution. every state publishes annually a great number of statistical works. these comprehend the statistics of the great elements of business and industrial and social life. a student who under takes to examine any line of state statistical works finds him self involved in a mass of facts and deductions almost impossible to analyze or classify. as the states have grown, their interests have expanded, and these interests have demanded the facts relative to state activities. so we have statistics of insanity, pauperism, insurance, banking, pailroads, great manufactures, statistics of everything, in fact, that relate to the activities of the people, births, deaths, marriages, and now divorce, everything, as i have said, that relates to the activities and social environment of the people. the federal government, in addition to the work of its census, sends out every year numerous volumes containing the most valuable statistical information on the finances of the country, immigration, shipping, the carrying trade, commerce, indians, and patents, and many other lines of important statistical in formation. in 1869 there was instituted here in massachusetts a new 111 address of carroll d. wright, president. 11 era of statistical work. this came through the establishment by the legislature of the bureau of statistics of labor. after a few years of work other states established similar offices, often with different designations, but, as a rule, under a law providing substantially what the law of massachusetts provided for the bureau of statistics of labor. there is now a chain of these bureaus extending from one end of the country to the other, numbering, i believe, 34 offices, while in 1884 the federal government established a similar office which was organized in 1885. as near as i can calculate, the reports of this chain of bureaus number something like seven hundred volumes, and they constitute a vast storehouse of social and industrial information, some of the volumes not very good, but most of them of an excellent character. they here and there show the lack of a power of analysis and classification, but on the whole, with one or two exceptions, they are honest reports. and i think, too, there has been but one spirit pervading the heads of this great chain of offices. that spirit has dominated the work everywhere, and even when the head of such an office has been appointed for purely political reasons the incumbent has soon realized the sacredness of his office and he has learned that to tell a statistical lie is the most harmful thing a man can do. he becomes inspired with the idea that he must tell the truth. in this connection i cannot deprive myself the pleasure of relating an experience of mine. i took charge of the massachusetts bureau in june, 1873, and on doing so i sought the advice of general francis a. walker, adopting for my guide the sentiments contained in his reply, and i believe i can do a service by quoting it in full: dear sirs, i have given much thought to the letter in which you do me the honor to ask me my views as to the work of the massachusetts bureau of labor statistics; but, as the result, i find but little to say beyond expressing my hearty sympathy with the purposes of your office and my wishes for its success. i feel the strongest confidence that the commonwealth is prepared for your work, and that the work can be done to the satisfaction of all citizens; and that. your office has only to prove itself alike superior to partisan dictation and to the seductions of theory in order to command the cordial support of the press and of the body of citizens. if any mistake is more likely than others to be committed in such a critical position, it is to undertake to recognize both parties as parties, and to award so much in due turn to each. this course almost inevitably leads to jealousy and dissatisfaction. if an office is strong enough simply to consider the body of citizens and to refuse to recognize or entertain consideration of parties, success is already in the main assured. public confidence once given, the choice of agencies, the selection of inquiries to be propounded, are easy and plain. the country is hungry for information ; everything of a statistical character or even of a statistical appearance is taken up with an eagerness that is almost pathetic; the community have not yet learned to be half skeptical and critical enough in respect to such statements. all this is favorable to such laudable efforts aa you are engaged in, for the difficulty of collecting statistics in a new country requires much indulgence; and i have strong hopes that you will so distinctly and decisively dis connect the massachusetts bureau of labor statistics from politics, from dependence on organizations, whether of workingmen or of employers, and from the support of economical theories, individual views, or class interests as to command the moral support of the whole body of citizens and to receive the co operation of all men of all occupations and of all degrees, without reference, however, either to their degrees or their occupations. the time had arrived when the public was, as general walker states, hungry for statistical information and adopted it pathetically. i think it was this attitude of the public that enabled this great chain of bureaus to meet with success. the rigid and religious observance of his precepts enabled the massachusetts bureau to set an example followed, as i have said, by thirty four states and the federal government, and now it has been followed by every civilized country in the world. i do not think of any government that has not established a bureau founded on the lines of the original massachusetts office. and yet it was something different from hunger for statistical information that caused the massachusetts office to be established. in the legislature of that year 1869 there were petitions for the incorporation of the knights of st. crispin. the petitioners were given leave to withdraw. there had been for three or four years recommendations by one commission after another for the establishment of a bureau whose sole duty it should be to collect statistics relating to industrial conditions, etc. nothing had come of them. the rejection of the petition of the knights of st. crispin caused the members of the legislature towards the end of its session to become aware of the fact that a political mistake had been made. they could not take up the petition again very well and incorporate the knights 0f st. crispin, so all at once a bill was introduced providing for the establishment of a bureau of statistics of labor, and this bill was carried through very promptly and rapidly under a suspension of the rules, the members of the prevailing party in the legislature having an idea that by doing this they would appease the labor element, especially the knights of st. crispin, which was very strong in those days. the result politically was not satisfactory, but by this action the legislature of massachusetts set the pace by feeding this hunger and appeasing the pathetic appeal for statistical information. what constitutes the great difference between the statistics of the present time and those of forty or more years ago? statistics have been called “dry bones.” mr. north, in an address a few years ago, stated that statisticians resented this popular idea about the dry bones of statistics, that there is nothing dry about them, that they are moist, juicy, fragrant as all the “perfumes of arabia. they are more poetic than poetry, more artistic than art, more musical khan music, more philosophical than philosophy. he thought then, and i think he is of the same opinion now, that the temptation to weave romances out of statistics is so strong that some so called statisticians are wholly unable to resist it, and this is mainly true. this romantic idea leads to what we know as the statistical mechanic, the man who is ready to construct tables to order. yet the real statistician, the man who is working out the process of meking them, does not make tables to order, but he puts an integrity and devotion into his work that is not surpassed in any other line of official conduct. the spirit of the modern statistician lies in the precepts laid down by general walker and in the fact that there is something deeper and more comprehensive than the mere statement of figures, for the statistician must have the spirit of what again mr. north has called ethical philosophy, the recognition of the existence of the great fundamental law, the principle which governs this world and all things in it, the principle of evolution. how perfectly true this is, and how absolutely lacking was this spirit at the time of the organization of this association! the modern statistician makes statistics popular by presenting their results in popular and readable form. the official statistician is under limitations in this respect, for his work, no matter what his spirit is, must, to a certain degree, be conventional, for it must be official in its character; but the association to which we are devoted can put this spirit into its work in interpreting the. statistics of the government. the field for our exploitation is vast and rich, and it is growing vaster and richer as time goes on. we now have what we have long needed, a permanent census office, a great clearing house of federal statistics, and more and more congress will use it as the vehicle for sending out to the people its costly information. not only this, but more and more will it consolidate into the census office other statistical works, so that there shall be harmony in preparation, unity and science in presentation. the united states now holds a unique position in statistical work. as i have intimated, no other country approaches it. any one who has given any consideration whatever to the volumes and bulletins which are coming out of that office must concede this fact, and feel proud every time that such a volume is examined that we not only now have an office competent, adequate, skillfully manned to make it a great clearing house of statistical information, but that we have a man, one of our own vice presidents, at the head of it who comprehends that spirit to which i have alluded, who has the judgment, the intellect, and the ability which makes him pre eminently the peer of any statistician the world can name, and holding a field and having an opportunity not even approached by any other statistician on earth. he understands clearly the duty to which he is assigned. he understands not only the present scope of his work, but what it may be made to reach in the future. he knows that he is painting a grand and enduring picture, not in bright colors mixed and laid by an artist’s hand on canvas which might not tell at the close of another century of the work of our generation, nor yet in glowing words of description by sentences constructed by most gifted writers, whose language one hundred years hence might not mean all the interpretation we give it in our time, nor in any of the perishable methods which convey to posterity as much of the vanity of a people as of the reality which makes the common wealth of to day; but that he sets the picture in cold, enduring arabic characters, which have survived through the centuries that have passed, unchanged and unchangeable by time, by accident, or by decay, and will remain through the ages to come as truthful as of old. they are the symbols that have unlocked to us the growth of the periods which make up our past. they are the fitting and never changing symbols by which to tell the story of our present state, so that, when the age we live in becomes the past of successive generations of men, the story and the picture shall be found to exist in all the just proportions in which it has been set by ourselves. a quiet and may be unlovely setting the statistician chooses, but he knows it will endure through all time. at the close of the address of the president, dr. samuel w. dike said this address has noted the many state bureaus of labor (34 in all, i think) besides the national bureaus that have grown out of the massachusetts bureau of labor statistics. mr. wright, i believe, might have also mentioned two or three important european statistical bureaus that owe their origin largely to our massachusetts bureau. i happen to have heard from excellent authority many years ago the story of the way in which the massachusetts bureau was saved from impending extinction and started on the road to success. the briefest statement of an incident will give you the clue. the massachusetts bureau had dragged along for three or four years, and seemed to be on its last legs. governor washburn sent for colonel carroll d. wright, then a young man scarcely rising above thirty years of age, who was completing his term of service in the state senate, and said to him, “i have watched your work on some measures before the legislature, and now i want you to take this bureau of labor and make it or bust it!” after consider able urging on the part of the governor, the young man, who was intent on returning to his excellent law practice and was without statistical experience, consented.

Hoffman, Vice President of ASA)",1910-12-28,"S. N. D. North","1908-1939","during the last fifty years the material progress of the united states has by far outdistanced the corresponding progress of any other nation in the world. from a population of and a national wealth of there has been an increase to over population and probably to over of national wealth. the evidences of measurable economic progress are so numerous and so much a matter of general knowledge that they do not require to be restated here in detail, but the facts of our social advance are less generally known, in that the statistical evidence concerning social facts and forces is less readily reducible to terms of common understanding. the general public is quite familiar with the elementary facts of progress in trade and transportation, banking and currency, agriculture, manufactures, and mines and quarries, but the facts concerning the progress of our social institutions are but imperfectly understood, and of these there is none of greater national importance than life insurance as carried on by legal reserve companies conducting either an ordinary or an industrial business, or both. insurance and savings. marvelous as the national progress has been in the development of material resources even more marvelous has been the advance in the development of social institutions which minister to human welfare and by distributing the risks arising out of the uncertainty of human life bring about the highest attainable degree of economic security and aid in the equitable redistribution of wealth and the conservation of accumulated capital. writers on social economics arc apt to overemphasize the social value of thrift institutions, which rest exclusively upon the savings function, but obviously the combination of savings and insurance must by its very nature serve a larger social and economic purpose than the single function of savings. there is this much also to be said on the subject of savings as an individualistic function, that it often fails because of inherent weakness due to the absence of compulsion or semi compulsion necessary to secure the achievement of the original purpose* with perhaps serious personal and social results. life insurance not only fosters saving habits, but by its nature makes such habits systematic and semi compulsory. how ever strong the determination may be on the part of the ordinary savings bank depositor to make periodical deposits and to leave the deposits untouched until they have attained to a given amount, it is rare that this intention is carried into full effect and that really systematic habits of saving are acquired. when, therefore, the social economist calls attention to the growth in savings banks deposits, which in 1860 amounted to $149,000,000 and which have increased to $3,713,000,000 in 1909 he is apt to overlook the fact that the colossal amounts now on deposit in savings banks do not represent the result of systematic saving habits, but rather the surplus income of large numbers, which as a matter of economic well being rather than because of sacrifice and deliberate intention, have been set aside to provide security for the time of need.? quite different, however, is the case of life insurance accumulations, in which the premiums in most cases represent a voluntary, agreed upon sacrifice, in the form of periodical contributions, annually, semi annually, quarterly, monthly, or even weekly, as the case may be.$ economic necessity for life insurance. it must also be taken into account in a comparison of savings and insurance, the living wage of women workers; that the vast sums to the credit of savings banks depositors are very far indeed from representing, as they are often assumed to do, the sole accumulations of the thrifty and the poor. savings banks, having their origin in charitable intentions, and being in law and in fact, to a certain extent, charitable institutions,* it is nevertheless an incontrovertible fact that a large proportion of the amounts on deposit represent the accumulations of the wealthy, or of a class for whom these institutions were not designed. in life insurance, how ever, it may safely be asserted, the large majority of the policies taken out represent the economic necessities of wage earners and those whose incomes are on a salary basis but within modest limitations, although, of course, a fair proportion of the policies and a larger proportion of the amounts of insurance stand to the credit of those who are in comfortable, or even very prosperous, circumstances. it is, therefore, not inappropriate that a comparison or contrast should be made of the progress of this institution during the last half century, which measures the largest material progress which this country has ever known. in 1860, according to the eighth united states census,:: the number of life insurance companies in the united states was 47, insuring 60,000 persons for the amount of $180,000,000, and the annual premium in come was $7,000,000. but it is open to question whether the census returns are entirely trustworthy, since no similar inquiry had theretofore been made and many of the smaller companies are probably omitted from the schedules. the differences in numbers and amounts, however, are not of very material importance, for it is brought out by the report of the new york insurance department of 1860 that there were then 17 companies transacting business in that state, of which six were companies of other states, while the aggregate number of policies in force with both the companies of new york state and other states was 56,046, insuring $163,703,455, or $6.08 per capita of white population. insurance returns of the census, it is pointed out in the preliminary report* that “the progress of insurance in the united states has been rapidly following the development of commerce and trade, of which it is the necessary accompaniment, since the system of buying and selling goods on credit necessitates the resort to every possible means of making those credits safe. none is more obvious than that of requiring all goods to be insured. it follows that as commodities increase in quantity and value, the amount to be covered by insurance must expand in the same direction. unfortunately, however, there have been no regular statistics collated from year to year, as in the case of banks, by which that interesting index to the growth of the national wealth might be compared.” when this was written, insurance in all its branches was not in a very flourishing condition in the united states. the capital required for the establishment of large and aggressive insurance institutions was more profitably employed in other fields of commercial enterprise. the previous history of insurance in this country had not been particularly encouraging and some of the more important earlier life insurance institutions had been converted into trust companies, while a few quite promising undertakings had failed with disastrous results. the rise of mutual insurance, beginning with the mutual life of new york in the year 1843, had brought for ward a number of active institutions, whose growth, how ever, for a time was hindered by the disturbed state of the nation during the decade preceding the outbreak of the civil war. early insurance institutions. the early his tory of insurance previous to 1860 is, however, one of much interest and, in many respects, of particular significance.f the first life insurance institution, as distinct from a moneyed state corporation (in the modern sense), established in the united states was the presbyterian ministers’ fund of philadelphia, which dates from the year 1759. this fund, however, was rather in the nature of a charitable corporation, for the benefit and relief of impecunious clergymen and their dependents, and only a small amount of business appears to have been transacted, since in 1845 only one policy was in force for the amount of $1,000. in 1875 the fund was authorized to transact a general life insurance business as a corporation, and it has since attained to an institution of greater importance. following the presbyterian ministers’ fund, a similar and semi charitable corporation was established in 1769, for the benefit of the clergymen of the protestant episcopal church, but in this case also the amount of insurance business transacted was very small and no record of the business actually done seems to have been preserved. early insurance corporations. the state of pennsylvania chartered the insurance company of north america, which was the first insurance corporation, properly to be so called, in the united states. this company, while organized primarily for the purpose of transacting marine insurance, had authority under its charter to write insurance on lives, but only a small amount of business was ever done, and that was in the nature of individual risk assumption, similar to the practice of marine underwriting. it was quite common at this early period to grant policies on the lives of persons, chiefly ship owners or masters, against capture by pirates on the barbary coast, or elsewhere. some of the risks were assumed at the rate of two percent. for the voyage, while in other cases as much as five percent. was paid, in return for insurance against the risk of capture or death. policies of this kind usually read that, should the insured “be killed in any attempts made to defend the said ship against the said algerians or corsairs, or should he die before or after his captivity, the insurers should not be bound to pay any other sum or sums than which may have been expended in attempting the ransom.” according to the history of the insurance company of north america, ‘(there have been few policies of this kind issued, perhaps half a dozen, in each of which we have granted the premium. price’s tables are those we have used, as far as tables have been recurred to.” in fact, the theoretical considerations of insurance at this time were considered secondary to the practical necessity of estimating the risk factor as a matter of individual hazard and not in the nature of combined hazard determined by the law of average, with due consideration to the expectation of life and the principle of compound interest. * first life insurance company. it was not until 1812, however, that the first life insurance company was chartered, by the state of pennsylvania. this was the pennsylvania company for insurances on lives and annuities, an account of which, including tables of rates, was published in the year 1814. the tables give premium for one year, for seven years, and on the whole life plan, from ages eight to sixty seven. the rate per $100 of insurance on the whole life plan was $2.12 at age 15, $2.93 at age 30, and $4.29 at age 45. the company also published tables of annuities to be purchased for $100 paid down on a single life, from birth to age ninety five. joint annuity tables and deferred annuity tables, as well as endowments for children, were offered to the public, but, apparently, only a small amount of business was ever done, and no full account of what was done seems to have been pub1ished. the beginnings of corporate life insurance in the united states. in 1818 the massachusetts hospital life insurance company was established, but the amount of business trans acted was very small, and according to a return of april, 1845, there were then in force only 142 policies, for the sum of $238,125 of insurance. in 1830,f the new york life insurance and trust company came into existence, but the amount of life insurance business transacted was small and some years later the company limited itself to a trust business, which it continues to carry on at the present time.0 the baltimore life among other early life insurance companies, reference may be made to the manhattan company, of 1808, originally chartered by the state of new york for the purpose of providing a water supply but which, under its charter rights, could engage in other branches of business, including insurance. in 1818 the union insurance company of new york was chartered, and in 1823 the duchess county insurance company, also of the city of new york. chancellor kent, writing in 1828, in his commentaries on law, made the statement that life insurance “has within the last fifteen years been introduced into the united states; it in now slow& but gradually attracting the public attention and confidence in our principal cities.” life insurance progress. insurance company was established in 1830, but subsequently the business was reinsured in the new york equitable. in 1835 the new england mutual of boston was granted a charter, but the company did not commence business until 1844. this company started with a guaranteed capital of $100,000, redeemable at the end of ten years, and it has continued as a successful mutual institution to the present time. in 1836 the girard life and trust company of philadelphia came into existence, and by 1845 it had 389 policies in force, for $1,015,275 of insurance. this company, like the new york life and trust, subsequently limited itself to a trust busi ness, which it also has continued to carry on to the present day. in 1838 the globe life and trust company of philadelphia was established, but the company never did much business, and ceased operations in 1857. in 1840 the ohio life and trust company was organized in cincinnati, ohio. the company concerned itself largely with the banking busi ness and did only a small amount of life business. it rein sured its policies in 1856 in the jefferson life, but in 1857, both companies failed, causing the panic of that year. all of the fore going companies, with the exception of the new england mutual,* have only remote historical interest at the present time. the rise of mutual life insurance in america as con ducted on modern principles has been entirely subsequent to the year 1840, and it was not until 1843 that the mutual life insurance company of new york commenced business, and that event marks the beginning of a new era in life insurance development. by 1845 this company had 908 policies in force, for nearly $3,000,000 of insurance. the early success of this institution brought about the organization of a large number of mutual and proprietary life insurance companies during the next twenty years, most of which have continued in successful operation to the present date. a list of these is given in table i of the appendix, including the companies commencing business between february 1,1843, and october 13, 1875. the table includes thirty seven companies, which on the first mutual life insurance company had 89.6 percent of the total legal reserve life insurance in force in the united states. these companies, therefore, constitute the historical basis of life insurance development in the united states previous to the introduction of industrial insurance in 1875 by the organization of the prudential insurance company of america, which again marks the beginning of a new era of business development, with results vastly more impressive than those achieved during the previous quarter century of life insurance operations. industrial and ordinary life insurance. the difference between industrial and ordinary legal reserve life insurance is chiefly in the method of premium payments, in that in the former the premiums are paid weekly and collected from the houses of the insured, while in the latter the premiums are paid quarterly, semi annually, or annually at the offices of the company. on account of the expense incurred in the house to house collection of industrial premiums the cost of such insurance is necessarily higher, but the policies being almost entirely for relatively small amounts, averaging not over $150, a totally different class of policyholders is represented by industrial insurance, chiefly wage earners and their dependents, subject in greater or less degree to a higher mortality rate, aside from questions of occupation, race and nativity, than prevails among ordinary policyholders, insured for average amounts of not less than $2,000. this distinction is of such importance that in any statistical consideration of life insurance progress it requires to be constantly kept in mind, and the two forms of insurance must be separately considered except in so far that in the aggregates of assets and liabilities the two may be combined.* fraternal insurance hardly falls within the scope of this discussion but may be briefly referred to as fundamentally different and distinct from legal reserve life insurance, in that in the former, reserves are either not required or have been inadequately provided for when their accumulation has been recognized as being imperatively necessary. fraternal insurance rests primarily upon the bond of mutual between those who have associated themselves for the purpose of mutual aid, with insurance as a secondary consideration. societies of this nature commence usually with young people who have seceded from older lodges or societies, on account of high assessments, and at the outset the rates are very low and many years are often required before an increasing average age makes additional assessments necessary, with the ultimate result that failure becomes imminent unless additional dues or assessments are raised to extraordinary pro portions. this has practically been the history of the rise and fall of assessment fraternal insurance in america, as well as of the earlier friendly societies in england. within recent years a material modification in plans and purposes has be come recognized among those responsible for the larger and more important of these institutions, and the tendency at the present time is in the direction of conformity to actuarial principles derived from the experience of legal reserve life insurance companies, to the incalculable advantage of those who have invested their surplus savings in what at best is a pseudo form of insurance, but one which has been widely developed among a class most in need of insurance protection by sound and solvent institutions.* the subject of insurance received its first public consideration at the statistical congress, held in paris in 1855. insurance was also mentioned in the inaugural address by h. r. h. the prince consort,, in opening the statistical congress in 1860. it was not, however, until the fifth international statistical congress was held in berlin in 1863 that doctor engel, the director of the prussian statistical bureau, delivered an elaborate address on insurance in a very learned dissertation, which to this day constitutes the most thoroughly digested discussion of the theoretical and practical aspects of insurance statistics in all its branches. the discussion by engel includes observations upon the place of insurance in economics, and he insurance at the fifth international statistical congress. was of the opinion that it should properly be considered an element of production. he held that insurance furthered and fostered productive enterprise, such as industry generally, and the address deserves to be taken into consideration by all who would do justice to the statistical aspects of insurance science. the only previous occasion when the subject of legal reserve life insurance has been brought to the attention of the american statistical association was in a brief address on life insurance, by mr. walter c. wright, in 1888. the number containing the article by mr. wright has long been out of print, and it is therefore to be hoped that the present discussion will meet the demand for a convenient analysis of the essential statistical facts of life insurance experience.* sources of statistical information. the sources of in formation concerning the progress of life insurance *in the united states are chiefly the annual reports of the insurance departments of the several states, the reports for individual companies, and the annual compilation of returns made by insurance periodicals. the most useful and trustworthy re turns are those of the new york, massachusetts and connecticut insurance departments, which extend over a long period of years but which are limited to the business trans acted in the respective states by local companies or the com panies of other states authorized to do business therein. the returns of the new york insurance department are most frequently made use of to exhibit the progress of life insurance in the united states, but during very recent years the number of local companies in other states has so largely increased that the new york returns are now of less general utility. next to the reports of the new york insurance department, the *the most to present statistical facts of insurance in all its branches throughout the world. is the insurance atlas (german and french texts). companies which have since gone out of existence. most trustworthy sources of information concerning all the statistical elements of life insurance are the “insurance year books” published annually by the spectator company, supplemented by the pocket index which contain a mass of statistical information derived either from special reports or secured direct from the various companies. in addition to these sources of information, a most useful work of reference, which is now in its sixth annual issue, is “best’s life insurance reports,” published which includes all legal reserve companies transacting business in the united states and canada, and fraternal societies and assessment associations operating in the united states. the gradually diminishing utility of the new york insurance reports as a source of information concerning the aggregate amount of business transacted by life insurance companies of the united states is made evident by the statement that while in 1890 the proportion of business transacted by companies authorized to do business in the state of new york was 97.8 percent. of the aggregate life insurance business of the united states, the proportion had decreased to 88.7 percent. by 1909. following the new york legislative investigation of 1905, and the restrictive laws enacted subsequently thereto, a large number of new companies were organized, especially in the southern, central, western and far western states, chiefly for local purposes and with only a very limited amount of business transacted in other states. for various reasons most of these companies do not transact business in the state of new york, and while the extent of their business operations is not as yet relatively large it is becoming a factor of increasing importance, and for this reason alone the returns of the new york insurance department for recent years do not fully represent the life insurance development of the united states as a whole. insurance as a problem in statistics. to ascertain with entire accuracy and completeness the total extent of life insurance throughout the united states for each year of the last half century would involve an entirely original investigation which would require access to all the insurance reports of the several states, and even then the information would not be complete since many of the companies of the southern and western states made no reports during the earlier years of the period when no insurance departments had been established. for practical purposes, however, it would seem to be sufficient to utilize the new york insurance department returns for the years previous to 1880, and the returns as published in the “spectator year books” for the years subsequent to 1880 except that for the year 1860 the returns of the eighth census are probably the most trust worthy. it may also safely be assumed that the new york insurance department reports previous to 1880 represent fully 95 percent. of the total united ‘states business properly within the definition of legal reserve life insurance. for a number of small companies during the earlier period of american life insurance history, it is sometimes rather difficult to establish the exact status, for in some instances at least organizations that were originally assessment companies were subsequently converted into legal reserve life insurance institutions or an approximation thereto. state supervision of insurance. it requires further to be taken into consideration that in the absence of federal insurance supervision and control the several states have entire jurisdiction in the matter of statutory requirements, and not only do these vary widely but with the result that the statistical reports occasionally fail to agree in matters of detail, particularly when different standards of mortality or interest require different valuations of the same company transacting business in several states. this conflict of statutory requirements affects chiefly, however, the financial items assets, liabilities, reserve, and surplus, but in most of the tables which follow these items have been derived from the reports of the new york insurance department, which seem to be the most useful for the present purpose. it may not be out of place here to briefly refer to the origin of the system of state supervision, which in its present form dates from 1855, when the massachusetts department was established, and the first annual report of which, contain ing the returns for that year, was published in 1856. the first new york insurance department returns are for the 131 life insurance progress. 679 year 1860, but the reports are not entirely trustworthy until about 1864.* in 1860 a brief report on insurance was made in connection with the eighth census, and regarding the ex tent of life insurance, it was shown that there were then 47 companies in operation in the united states, having 60,000 policies in force, insuring $180,000,000. according to the new york insurance department report for the same year, there were then only 18 companies reporting in that state, of which 16 were and 2 foreign. the massachusetts insurance report for 1860 returned only 19 companies, so that at the beginning of the last half century a large number of companies transacted business throughout the united states, of which only a relatively small proportion carried on business in the states of new york and massachusetts. while the number of companies transacting business outside of the states of new york and massachusetts in 1s60 was relatively large, the amount of business done by them was relatively small and of no very material importance. in 1870 the new york insurance report returned 71 companies in active operation, while the massachusetts insurance report returned only 65. the total number of different companies mentioned in the two reports was 75, and it may safely be assumed that over 1oc different companies were actually transacting business throughout the united states in that year. ko very trustworthy information, however, is avail able concerning the extent of the business operations, but it is practically certain that the new york insurance depart ment returns for that year contained about 95 percent. of the total business transactions. the panic and long continued financial depression during the seventies resulted disastrously to many companies, and quite a number of others failed, while others were absorbed by more solvent institutions. a consequent material reduction took place in the number of companies reporting to the new york insurance department, which is reflected in the returns contained in the “spectator year book” for 1850, according to which there were ‘for an historical discussion of the origin and development of insurance law and legislation then only about fifty companies in actual operation. the subject of insurance was inquired into that year in connection with the tenth census, but the results were never published. following 1880 the number of companies in active operation remained about the same during the decade ending with 1890, when, according to the ‘(spectator year book,” there were only 50 companies in operation, but this number, by 1900, had increased to 76, and by 1909 to 189, while on december 31, 1910, there were 214. it may be questioned, however, whether the spectator returns are entirely complete with regard to a number of small companies in some of the southern and western states, concerning which it is most difficult to secure trustworthy and complete statistical information. in the follow ing discussion, which is largely statistical, it has seemed best not to include any of the larger tables in the text, but the data are presented in the form of tabular abstracts, derived in each case from the tables in full as given in the statistical appendix. the tables are intended to serve as a trustworthy basis for future statistical inquiries into the progress of life insurance throughout the united states, and the comments are, therefore, limited to matters which seem to require a brief explanation, without reference to purely theoretical or controversial considerations. for a more general appreciation of life insurance statistics, it is necessary to emphasize the great practical importance of uniformity in statistical reports, accuracy in detail, and impartiality, as well as technical qualifications in the analysis of the returns. the historical development of life insurance statistics proves conclusively the neglect of conformity to fundamental statistical principles, but a consideration of these lies outside of the scope of the present discussion. it need only be said here that many important social facts concerning life insurance progress, such as the distribution of risks by amounts, sex, age, occupation, etc., are not made available through the official reports as pub limitations of the present statistical inquiry. under the direction of editor of the weekly underwriter. new york. by the insurance departments which properly limited to the fundamental facts and consideration of solvency, in general conformity to statutory requirements. life insurance, however, is so obviously ai: important element in the political economy of modern nations that the qualified statistical presentation of life insurance experience should receive more consideration than heretofore has been the case. part 11. statistical analysis. as was pointed out in the introductory remarks, the modern progress of ordinary life insurance in the united states dates from the commencement of business by the mutual life insurance co. of new york in 1843, and of industrial insurance from the commencement of business by the prudential insurance co. of america in 1875. the new england mutual had been chartered in 1835, but it did not begin business until 1844, and was followed a year later by the mutual benefit of newark, n. j., and the new york life insurance go. (originally the nautilus) which commenced business on april 17, 1845. the second company to commence industrial business was the john hancock mutual of boston, in 1879, and in the same year the business of industrial insurance was commenced by the metropolitan insurance co. of new york.* of the 214 companies in active operation in the united states on december 31,1910, 37 were organized previous to december 31,1875. the overshadowing importance of these older institutions is brought out in table i, according to which out of an aggregate of $16,404,261,000 of ordinary and industrial insurance 89.6 percent. was in force with companies commencing business previous to december 31, 1875. table i gives the details for 37 companies, including the name, the domicile, and the year of commencing business. for reasons which cannot be fully discussed on this occasion, a large number of new companies have been organized during the last five years, but the majority of these transact but a relatively small amount of the aggregate business. in table i1 the companies have been arranied accord * the germania life insurance company and the provident s a m of new york. a h commenced the business of individual insurance this year, but both companies have long m c e discontinued the practice. to the year of commencing business, and it is shown, for illustration, that 116 companies, commencing business sub sequent to january 1, 1906, constituting 54.21 percent. of the total number, transacted on december 31, 1910, only 2.58 percent. of the aggregate amount of life insurance in force. in contrast, fire companies, commencing business between 1813 and 1845, transacted 26.82 percent. of the total amount of insurance in force with life insurance companies on december 31, 1910. the details of this annualy sis are particularly instructive, emphasizing, as they do, the most recent development of the business, largely as the result of the legislative insurance investigation of sew york in 1005 and of several other states in 1906. the importance of this development, which permits of no useful comparison with earlier periods of life insurance history, warrants the inclusion of some additional details, given in table 111. this table makes the distinction of active american life insurance companies, by states of domicile, commencing business before and subsequent to december 31, 1905. the 98 companies commencing business previous to 1906 had 97.4 percent. of the aggregate amount of life insurance in force, while the 116 companies commencing business subsequent to december 31, 1905, had only 2.6 percent. of the total amount of life insurance in force. the comparison by individual states is particularly suggestive, and it is shown that most of the new companies have been organized in the western and southern states. it requires to be explained that the table shows for each state the amount of insurance in force with the companies of that state, either incorporated therein, or having their domicile therein, with the distinction of the companies commencing business before or subsequent to december 31, 1905. the rapid increase in the number of life insurance companies cannot be considered a healthy symptom of business development, but to the contrary, the organization of so large a num ber of new institutions foreshadows possible business disaster in years to come. on examination of the returns of the new york insurance department for the first twenty years of the period under review, it appears that the number of companies 171 life insurance progress. 683 reporting to that department, as transacting new business in the state of new york, increased from 17 in 1860 to 71 in 1870, subsequent to which the number decreased to 50 by 1874 and to only 31 by 1879. the stringent requirements of admission and supervision, on the part of companies of other states to transact business in the state of new york, accounts for the fact that the number of such companies is less at the present time than in former years. on december 31, 1910, of the 33 companies transacting business in the state of new york, only 22 were companies of other states. the disastrous insurance experience of the seventies ha.s not been forgotten in the state of new york, nor in most of the eastern states, where the insurance departments have attained to a high degree of administrative efficiency. * correspondingly, there have been comparatively few insurance failures of material importance, and while the information on the subject is not entirely complete or conclusive, the facts, as far as known, have been incorporated in table iv, which shows the number of life insurance companies that have failed, or retired from business, or been absorbed by other com panies during the period 1813 1910, according to returns compiled from the “spectator year book” for 1911. it is shown by this table that out of 230 companies which have retired from business, 59 are stated to have failed, 33 retired or were liquidated, 113 were reinsured or became amalgamated with other companies, while for 25 the method or cause of retirement is not stated. of the 230 retired companies, 25 discontinued business previous to 1860, 123 retired during the years 1860 1884, while 82 have retired during the last 26 years. the most instructive discussion of life insurance failures is contained in a “review of life insurance” from the date of the first national convention of insurance officers, in 1871, to september, 1898, by the late john a. mccall, *for information concerning the development of state supervision of insurance companies in the united states, the proceedings of the national conventions of insurance commissioners should be con ulted. the conventions are held annually and the proeedings have been published for more than thirty years. the theory and practice of state supervision is ably brought out in the examination of insurance companies. by s. herbert w‘olfe, consulting actuary, published by the insurance press, new york. 1910. the testimony taken by the legislative investigating committee of the state of new york. including exhibits and the report of the commission, has been published in ten volumes by the brandow printing co., albany, n. y. 684 statistical association. president of the new york life insurance co., read before the twenty ninth national convention of insurance commissioners. the progress of legal reserve life insurance in the united states during the last half century is most conveniently measured by the aggregate amount of insurance in force, including both ordinary and industrial, and the number of policies, as well as the amount of insurance, for each of the years forming the period 1860 1910. the progress of industrial insurance, commencing with 1876, is given in table vii, according to which the number of industrial policies has increased from 1,377,150 in 1885, to 23,034,463 in 1910. the amount of industrial insurance in force has increased from $145,938,241 in 1885, when only three companies were in active operation, to $3,177,047,874 in 1910, when 23 companies were transacting this form of insurance. 191 life insurance progress. a large variety of life insurance policies are issued by life insurance companies, but these are most conveniently grouped under whole life, endowment, and miscellaneous plans.* the whole life includes limited payment insurance, that is, policies payable at death, but with premium payments limited to specified periods, usually 10, 15, or 20 years. endowment policies are payable during the lifetime of the insured, according to specified periods of duration, or in the event of the previous death of the insured, while miscellaneous policies include a large variety of plans, but chiefly term policies, or convertible term policies, which are increasing in popularity, probably on account of the low rates charged for the term period. it hardly requires to be stated that while in level premium life insurance the premium remains the same throughout the continuance of the policy, the premium rates vary according to age, being lowest at age 15 and highest at age 66, which is usually the maximum age at which insurance can be obtained. term insurance is at lower rates and is issued for a short period of years, usually 5 or 10, but in the case of convertible term policies, the insured has the option to exchange the contract for a regular form of policy at level premium rates. whole lie, or limited payment life policies aim primarily to provide the largest amount of family protection, while endowment policies provide in part for the personal needs of the insured. it is, therefore, a matter of considerable importance to know the relative distribution of insurance under the different plans mentioned and, accordingly, the facts have been given in table viii, which shows the number of ordinary policies in force with life insurance companies during the period 1870 1909,t classified by number of policies and plan of insurance. it is shown by this table that the proportion of whole life policies has increased from 72.9 percent. in 1870 to 78.6 percent. in 1879, subsequent to which the proportion declined to 62.8 percent. in 1904, but since that year there has been a slight increase in the proportion, to 63.9 corresponding changes have taken place in the case of endowment insurance, but the most significant tendency is to be observed in the case of other policies, chiefly term insurance, which in 1870 constituted 2.3 percent. of the total, increasing to 8.2 percent. by 1899, but decreasing t.0 6.6 percent. in 1909. more suggestive than the analysis of insurance classified by plan of insurance on the basis of the number of policies, is the classification by amounts in table ix. according to this table, the proportion of insurance on the whole life plan has changed from 76.9 percent. in 1870, to 66.7 percent. in 1910. the proportion of insurance on the endowment plan has changed from 21.1 percent. in 1870, to 23.0 percent. in 1910; but in marked contrast, the proportion of insurance on other plans, chiefly term insurance, has increased from 2 percent. of the aggregate in 1870, to 3.2 percent. in 1885, and 10.3 percent. in 1910. the details by single years are particularly instructive and the table emphasizes the trend of insurance towards plans which combine insurance protection with investment and insurance for comparatively short periods of time, partly for business purposes in the form of partner ship policies. table x exhibits the ordinary insurance in force with life insurance companies during the period 1870 1910, including the average amount of policies on all plans combined. the average has decreased from $2,684 in 1870 to $1,902 in 1910. the decrease is largely accounted for by the increasing proportion of ordinary insurance written by industrial companies. the average size of the ordinary policies in force with industrial companies on december 31, 1910, was $1,047, while the average size of policies 11 force with exclusively ordinary companies was $2,160. in 1910, of the total ordinary insurance written, 20.3 percent. was written by industrial companies. the average size of whole life policies, as given in table xi was $2,835 in 1870, as compared with $1,976 in 1909. the corresponding details concerning endowment insurance are given in table xii, according to which the average size of endowment policies has decreased from $2,278 in 211 life insurance progress. 687 1870, to $1,549 in 1909. in marked contrast to the decrease in the average size of whole life and endowment policies, is the increase in the average size of policies on other plans, which, according to table xiii, bas been from $2,315 in 1870, to $2,955 in 1909. the business of industrial insurance, while it conforms in all its essentials to life insurance on the ordinary plan, requires throughout separate consideration, in so far as the returns are available in a convenient form. the most important difference between ordinary and industrial insurance is in the smaller average size of the industrial policy, which, according to table xiv, has increased from $92 in 1876 to $110 in 1890, and $138 in 1909. in contrast, therefore, to a decreasing average policy in ordinary insurance on the whole life and endowment plans, there has been a marked increase in the average size of the industrial policy, which implies an increasing utility of this form of insurance in that it tends to serve other than merely burial purposes. the progress of life insurance has been at a variable rate from year to year, the rate of increase being governed largely by the amount of new insurance written and the terminations on account of lapses and surrenders, death losses, etc. the amount of new business has varied from a minimum of 9,563 new ordinary policies issued in 1861 to a maximum of 1,196,376 ordinary policies issued in 1904. the legislative investigations of life insurance companies in 1905 and 1906 and the resulting legislation materially checked the rate of increase on the part of the large companies, in consequence of which the new ordinary business issue declined to 753,843 policies in 1907, subsequent to which there has been a gradual recovery, to a policy issue of 993,218 ordinary policies in 1910. considered by amounts of insurance, the new ordinary policy issue increased from $35,589,934 in 1860, to $378,214,523 in 1885. the billion dollar mark was reached by 1893 and the issue of that year was $1,090,002,107. the maximum point was attained in 1904, when the total new issue reached nearly two billion dollars, or, to be exact, $1,990,205,121. the minimum point of decline subsequent to this maximum issue was in 1907, when the amount of new insurance was only $1,345,147,040, subsequent to which there has been a gradual recovery in the business, and in 1910 the new issue was $1,822,260,287. the details of the new ordinary issue are given in table xv. the new industrial issue has increased from 7,904 policies in 1876 to 2,133,739 policies in 1890, and to 5,365,825 policies in 1909. considered by amounts, the new issue has increased from $727,168 of industrial insurance in 1876, to $793,216, 616 in 1909. the information by single years is given in table xvi. the financial statistics of life insurance companies include numerous items which cannot be dealt with in detail in the present discussion. the essential factors of financial progress, however, are conveniently available, and table xvii exhibits the required information, concerning the admitted assets, surplus, and liabilities of life insurance companies for the 50 year period under review. accord ing to the table, the admitted assets have increased from $24,115,g87 in 1860, to $524,706,436 in 1885; by december 31, 1910, the assets had increased to $3,875,877,059. the term “admitted assets” may be briefly explained in the manner that the insurance departments exercise a considerable amount of arbitrary judgment as to , what constitutes the value of certain classes of securities, or personal property, with the result that the true assets are somewhat in excess of the admitted assets, but the difference has no important bearing upon considerations of solvency, except in the case of small companies, with a comparatively short duration of business existence. the liabilities of life insurance companies are chiefly the policy obligations determined by actuarial methods of valuation, in conformity to the statutory requirements of the several states. in the nature of legal reserve life insurance, a surplus requires to be accumulated for contingencies or other purposes, including the payment of so called dividends in the case of mutual life insurance companies. the tendency towards surplus accumulation has been checked within recent years by the discontinuance of the issuance of deferred dividend policies, but the use of the term surplus in the case of dividends of this nature is hardly applicable, although it has been common usage to do so for many years. the amount of admitted surplus held by american legal reserve life insurance companies has increased from $6,955,814 in 1860, to $93,154,549 in 1885, and to $549,998,693 in 1910. the ratio of liabilities to each $100 of assets has in creased from $71 in 1860 to $82 in 1885 and to $90 in 1907. subsequent to this year there has been a slight decrease to $87 in 1908 and to $85 in 1909, due partly to the discontinuance of the writing of deferred dividend policies and the increase in non participating insurance. there has been a correspond ing decrease in the ratio of surplus to assets, from $29 in 1860, to $18 in 1885, and to $14 in 1910, the minimum point of $10 having been reached in 1907. the decrease is more apparent than real, on account of changes in methods of surplus determination, but there is a definite tendency towards the curtailment of surplus accumulation, in conformity to the contingency reserve law of the state of new york. with a constantly diminishing amount and proportion of insurance on the deferred dividend plan, there must, of course, be a decrease in the ratio of so called surplus to assets, although under a more restricted definition a considerable proportion of what is technically called surplus is in fact a contingent policy lia bility. the details of assets, liabilities and surplus by single years are given in table xvii. the assets of life insurance companies are invested in conformity to the varying statutory requirements of the several states, but on the whole a considerable degree of uniformity has been obtained in departmental methods of supervision and control. table xviii gives the admitted assets according to the nature of the investment, the same being grouped into real estate, bonds and mortgages, united states stocks and securities, other stocks and bonds, collateral loans, premium notes and loans, cash in ofice and banks, deferred and unpaid premiums, and all other assets. the table gives the information as returned by the new york insurance department for the period 1865 1910. in table xix, however, the corresponding information is given for all of the life insurance companies, subsequent to that year the amounts have fluctuated considerably, with a strong tendency towards the gradual elimination of this class of securities among the investments of life insurance companies.* in 1909 the amount held was only $1,200,000. in marked contrast, there has been a large increase in the investments in other stocks and bonds, chiefly railway bonds and similar underlying securities, from $6,291,648 in 1865, to $1,744,687,047 in 1910. in accordance with the legislation enacted by the state of new york in 1906, life insurance companies are no longer permitted to invest in stocks, and the existing investments of that kind require to be liquidated within a specified period of time. the amount invested in stocks of different kinds was relatively, however, never a factor of material importance, and the facts in detail are set forth in table xix, in which a distinction is made of bonds owned and stocks owned, in place of the former distinction of united states stocks and bonds, and other stocks and bonds. the distinction is of considerable practi cal importance, and it is shown for 1909 that the amount invested in bonds other than real estate bonds and mortgages was $1,615,844,321, while the amount owned in stocks was $145,560,549, which latter amount had further decreased by december 31, 1910, to $129,622,493. life insurance companies are permitted to invest in collateral loans, which usually yield a remunerative rate of interest. the amount invested in such loans has naturally fluctuated considerably in response to the varying condition of the money market. in 1865 the amount invested in collateral loans was $966,032, a maximum amount of $66,012,028 having been reached in 1903. since then there has been a decline in the amounts invested in collateral loans, in conformity to more restrictive statutory requirements, and in 1910 the amount thus held was only $14,070,127. life insurance companies may loan upon the reserve value of t,heir own policies, largely for the purpose of preventing needless lapses and surrenders. the rate of inter est charged is usually five percent., so that loans of this nature constitute a desirable and remunerative form of investment, provided the proportion of such loans does not become unduly large. the practice has prevailed almost from the beginning of life insurance experience and as early as 1865 the amount in vested in premium notes and policy loans was $14,118,881. the earlier practice of premium notes has, however, long since been discontinued. by 1885 the amount invested in premium notes and loans was $18,694,821, and in 1910 the amount was $465,949,433. the nature of the business, there is an urgent necessity for the holding of considerable sums in cash, or in the form of bank balances, drawing the usual rate of two percent. interest.* obviously it is of importance to reduce the amount of cash in ofice, or in the form of bank balances, to a reasonable and practicable minimum, but it is only within recent years that, partly in conformity to statutory requirements, there has been a decided tendency towards an actual and relative reduction in the amounts of cash in ofice and banks. the amount thus held increased from $2,725,639 in 1865, to a maximum of $106,909,393 in 1903. subsequent to this year the amount has gradually decreased to $59,661,648 in 1909, and to $55,707,611 in 1910. in conformity to law or departmental practice, deferred and unpaid premiums in course of collection are admitted assets of life insurance companies. the amount of assets of this form has varied considerably during the earlier years, but the tend *this m partly on account of the long established methods of most of the companies to pay claims on the day pmofa of death are received and in which the documentary evidence warrants the conclusion that the claim is a valid one. 692 statistical association. 126 ency in recent years has been towards a proportionate reduc tion. companies usually allow 30 days’ grace in the pay ment of premiums, which is taken advantage of to a consid erable extent. in 1865 the amount held in deferred and unpaid premiums was $4,633,698, increasing to a maximum during the earlier period, partly because of disturbed financial and industrial conditions, of $22,567,031, in 1870. the amounts decreased subsequent to that year, reaching a mini mum point in 1879. there has been a gradual increase since that year, to a maximum amount of $45,149,901 in 1905, and a gradual reduction since that year to $40,571,715 in 1909. the item of deferred and unpaid premiums is naturally a non interest bearing ledger asset. aside from the foregoing items, there are a few which cannot conveniently be given in detail and which are combined under the term “all other assets,” the amount of which has increased from $1,169,012 in 1865, to $47,707,799 in 1910. all of the foregoing observations have reference only to the business details of companies reporting to the new york insurance department. as has previously been stated, more complete returns are available since 1888 and are given in detail in table xix, which also shows the change previ ously referred to as to bonds and stocks owned since 1902. it may further be observed in this connection that the general financial statistics include both ordinary and industrial busi ness, since the assets pertaining to the two branches cannot be conveniently separated, nor is such a separation required by the insurance laws of the several states. summarizing the financial statistics for the 189 companies for which the information was available in 1909, and as given in table xix, it is shown that the total admitted assets of legal reserve life insurance companies on de cember 31 of that year amounted to $3,643,857,971. of this amount $166,712,430, or 4.6 percent., was invested in real estate, and $1,084,345,817, or 29.8 percent., in real estate mortgages. the sum of $1,615,844,321 was invested in bonds other than real estate bonds and mortgages, and $145,560,549 in stocks. the two items of bonds and stocks combined con stituted 48.3 percent. of the total admitted assets. the 271 life insurance progress. 693 amount invested in collateral loans was $19,547,873, 'or 0.5 percent. of the aggregate, while the amount invested in p r e mium notes and loans was $446,276,468, or 12.2 percent. of the total. the amount of assets represented by cash in office and banks was $71,854,128, and the amount represented by deferred and unpaid premiums was $47,692,111. the two items com bined constituted 3.3 percent. of the total admitted assets. all other assets amounted to $46,224,274, or 1.3 percent. of the total. the income of life insurance companies is primarily derived from the premiums paid by polic.yholders and the interest earnings on invested funds. most of the companies transact also an annuity business, which, however, in the united states, has never attained t,o very considerable proportions. the total income of life insurance companies increased rapidly from $5,866,758 in 1860 to $118,573,782 in 1873. following that year the total income gradually declined to a minimum of only $78,389,485 in 1880, as the result of the financial and industrial depression of the period and the lamentable failure of a number of important life insurance institutions.* only slow progress was made during the next ten years, but by 1890 the total income had increased to $196,938,069, which by 1909 had further increased to $748,027,892. the business has now attained to such enormous magnitude that an experience similar to that of the seventies may safely be considered impossible. since, in the nature of legal reserve life insurance, large sums are required to be accumulated for the ultimate dis charge of maturing liabilities, the proportion of premium to total income tends naturally to decrease on account of the increasing sums derived in the form of interest on invested funds. in 1860 of the total income, 81.2 percent. was received from premiums, against 74.9 percent. in 19.09. the propor tion of income received in the form of annuity payments was 0.1 percent. in 1860, reaching a maximum proportion of 2.4 percent. in 1881 and the same proportion in 1883. the amounts, as well as t.he proportion, have fluctuated consider ably from year to year, and a minimum point was reached in 1908, when the percentage of annuity income was only 0.5. in 1909 the proportion was 0.7 percent. the income from investments and other sources constituted $1,097,227 in 1860, or 18.7 percent. by 1885 the amount of income from these sources had increased to $27,353,922, or 25.5 percent. on account of the vast amount of new insurance written during the twenty five years following, the relative proportion of income from other sources than premiums and annuities under went a decline during some years, but by 1909 the proportion was 24.4 percent., while the actual amount received as income from investments or other sources was 3182,798,999. the details by single years are set forth in table xx. the total disbursements of life insurance com panies have increased from $2,908,936 in 1860. to $81,499,913 in 1885, and to $505,360,483 in 1909. of the disbursements during the year 1909 $172,280,388, or 34.1 percent., was on account of death losses, $41,213,252, or 8.2 percent., was on account of matured endowments, and $7,382,565, or 1.5 percent., was on account of annuity payments. united states is still increasing at such a rapid rate that the ratio of the returns to policyholders in proportion to premium or total income does not yet represent normal conditions, which cannot be attained for many years to come. in other words, it is in the nature of level premium life insurance that vast sums require to be accumulated in anticipation of future policy obligations as they fall due, and it is on this account that the ratio of expenses, including agents’ commissions, taxes, etc., is relatively large and accounted for by the extraordinary growth of the business during recent years. it may further be pointed out that the large sums paid to policyholders on account of lapsed, surrendered or purchased policies reflect most favorably upon the more liberal practice of life insurance companies at the present time, in conformity, however, to statu tory requirements, protecting by legal safeguards the interests of the insured in the reserve value of his policy in the event of voluntary discontinuance previous to maturity or death. the earlier discussion of new ordinary insurance issued by life insurance companies, including revivals and additions, the details of which are contained in table xv, requires to be amplified by a discussion of policy termina tions, concerning which the necessary details, by numbers and amounts, are contained in tables xxii and xxiii. policy terminations may be voluntary by surrender or lapse, or by change or decrease, and a relatively large number of policies are cancelled in this manner, although the proportion of such cancellations to the total amount of insurance in force is gradually diminishing. there is probably no problem in life insurance administration more generally misunderstood than the lapse question, which is one of equally serious concern to the company as well as to its policyholders. a considerable amount of new insurance is written in good faith, but subse quently, for a variety of reasons, the insured is either not able or willing to assume the policy obligations.* under modern methods of state supervision only the paid for business is required to be reported, but since every policy is in force from *the ratio of rejected applicants variea coderably with the different companies, the c h of applicants solicited, the territcwy operated, etc., but approximately from 10 percent. fh 20 pa cent. of life insurance applicants are declined for medid or otha resaons. the date of issue for the period of time for which the premium has been paid, the insured has received the full equivalent value in the form of insurance protection. it may safely be asserted that everything possible is being done by conserv atively managed life insurance companies to reduce the lapse and surrender factors to a minimum, but since statutory require ments favor liberal surrender values, the companies are at a disadvantage in meeting a situation which is unquestionably one of the most perplexing problems of successful ofice ad ministration. it is evident that in a time of economic dis tress the tendency towards voluntary policy terminations is materially increased, and this is brought out by the details of table xxii, which shows an actually and relatively large number of terminations during periods of financial panics or industrial distress. it is not possible, within the limitations of this discussion to deal with the rather complex conditions which account for the wide fluctuations in the rela tive distribution of policy terminations, voluntary or other wise,* but all the essential facts, by numbers and amounts, as well as their distribution on a percentage basis for the entire period for which the information is available, is contained in tables xxii and xxiii. it may be pointed out, however, that while on the basis of numbers the proportion of policies lapsed during 1909 was 82 percent. of the total number of terminations, the proportion lapsed on the basis of amounts was only 57.8 percent. other interesting facts are disclosed by the tables referred to, which emphasize a most important chapter in life insurance history. for the purpose of further emphasizing the termination factor, table xxiv has been included, which exhibits the termination rates from surrenders and lapses of 27 ordinary life insurance companies in the form of percentages of the mean number of policies in force for each of the years 1891 1910, inclusive. is in marked mntrsst to the methods of ssvinga banhs, which require the forfeiture of intereat in the event of withdrawal of the deposit pre.ious to a given date. doring periods of panic or financial year book,” which, unfortunately, does not contain the actual numbers used in arriving at the percentages stated. it, however, may safely be assumed that the table has been derived from the official returns made by the 27 companies referred to. according to the table the percentage of policies terminated of the mean number of policies in force has decreased from 9.31 during the five years ending with 1895 to 6.11 during the five years ending with 1910. the table, therefore, warrants the conclusion that the tendency of the business is towards a reduction in the rate of voluntary terminations and, in a gen eral way, this conclusion may be said to apply to the entire business of life insurance companies at the present time. there has also been included in the present discussion life insurance companies, based upon the mean amount of insurance in force during the period 1891 1910. this table has been derived from the “spectator year book” for 1911 and represents the returns of identical companies, which may safely be considefed as approximately representing the condition of the entire business of life insurance companies during the period under review. the expense rate considered by five year periods increased from 0.96 percent. during the five years ending with 1905, to a maximum of 1.00 percent. dur ing the five years ending with 1905, but during the last five years the rate has very materially decreased, to an average of only 0.70 percent. the maximum expense rate has been 1.03 percent. while the minimum has been 0.66 percent. during 1910 the rate was 0.69 percent. as far as it is pos sible to judge, the tendency of the business at the present time is distinctly towards a reduction in the expense rate, but is practically certain that, owing to the conditions under which the business must be carried on, a further material reduction in the expense rate is not to be anticipated. while, theoret ically, the agency system may seem to be an unnecessary burden upon the business, which perhaps should not need earnest solicitation for its widest possible development, it is true nevertheless that without the employment of agents practically no business would be transacted. this has been the experience of the british government in its life insurance branch of the post office savings rank department, and it has also been the experience of several english companies which have been in existence for many years.* life insur ance without agents is, perhaps, theoretically desirable, but in the light of past experience the agent or solicitor is an indispensable factor, whose proper compensation is, therefore, as legitimate an item of expense as is the labor factor in trade, industry and transportation. the discussion of general insurance finance (table xx) with special reference to the items of the income account from other sources than premiums and annuities, requires to be amplified by a brief discussion of interest earnings on the basis of mean ledger assets, less capital employed in the conduct of the business, as carried on by stock corporations. the most useful data on the subject are contained in the a’nnual publica tions of mr. benjamin brown, on life insurance economics, and table xxvi is included by the courtesy of mr. brown and it has been brought down by him from 1875, previous to which no information is convcniently available. according to the table referred to, the rate of interest earned by life insurance companies has decreased from an average above 6 percent. during the three years 1875 1877, and an average above 6 percent. during the period 1878 1893, to an average somewhat above 4% percent. during the last sixteen years of the period under review. a maximum rate of 6.81 percent. was earned in 1875, while the minimum rate has been 4.57 percent., which was earned during the year 1905. as far as it is possi ble to judge, the normal interest earnings are not likely to fall much below 4.5 percent. and the probability is that an aver age rate between 4.5 percent. and 5 percent. will be main tained at least for some years to c0rne.i *see table xiv in my dseussion of state pension and annuities discussion of the probable future rate of interest as an interesting reminder of the fallacy in forecasting the future rate of intereat, the following is quoted from a letter during the five years ending with 1908. the rate earned during 1909 was 4.37 percent. the rate of interest earned on mort,gage loans has decreased from 5.43 per during the five year period ending with 1895, to 4.89 percent.. during the five year period ending with 1008. in contrast to t,he decline in the average rat,e of interest earned on bonds and stocks and mortgage loans, the rate of interest earned on real &ate has increased from 4.41 percent. during the five years ending with 1898 to 5.47 percent. during the five years ending with 1903, and 6.21 percent. during the five years ending with 1908. during the year 1909 the rate of interest earned on this class of investments was 6.42 percent. the rate of interest earned on all other securities, including loans on collateral, policy loans and cash in office and bank decreased from 4.38 percent. during the five years ending with 1898 to 4.29 percent. during the five years ending with 1903. subsequent to this period the rate increased to 4.71 percent. during the five years ending with 1908 and to 4.82 percent. during the year 1909. considering all classes of invest,ments, the interest rate has changed from 4.92 percent. during the five years ending with 1898 to 4.66 percent. during the two subsequent five year periods, and finally to 4.74 percent. during 1909.* during 1909 the rate earned was 5.02 percent. sir percent. per annum, for some ages to come, with an ample capital staked on the careful selection of risks. the safety of investments, and the economy of expenditure, a sir percent.reserve, on rate that exceed the net at six percent., must be ample tor thesecurity of the policyholders.” in a letter of mi. david parks fackler to mr. clark, dated new york, may 2, 1871, occurs the statement that: “ it is pretty certain that money ean be safely loaned at over six percent., during this generation at least. and, if in the future interest should steadily decline, the reserve can thm be gradually increased by assuming ratea of interest somewhat lower than six percent., which will fully provide for the safety of the insured. the premium rates of life insurance companies have naturally varied more or less during the fifty year period under review. in the case of participating companies, an adjustment between the expected and the actual mortality is arrived at by the payment of so called dividends, represent ing an overcharge in the original premium, the excess of which is returned to the policyholder upon the basis of actuarially ascertained business results. in the case of non participating insurance, the normal death rate observed to prevail among the insured is assumed to be a sufficiently accurate basis in premium calculations. the present practice of most of the state insurance depart.ments is to require the use of the experience table and with interest not higher than 3+ percent. in calculating the net premium rates, which are increased by the necessary addition for expenses and contin gencies, the proportion of which is now fixed precisely by the insurance laws enacted by the new york legislature and other states during 1906 and subsequent years. all of the large companies verify their annual experience by valuations to ascertain the actual financial results of their own past mor tality experience. the results of investigations of this kind have been published by a number of companies and they have been amplified by the “specialized mortality experience,” published under the direction of the actuarial society in 1903. a new investigation, including a large number of special classes of risks, is at present in course of being completed and when available will aid in the further improvement of the practice of life insurance in essential matters of detail. a comparison of non participating and participating premium rates by decennial periods is made in tables xxviii and xxix, which give the required information by single years of life, together with the number of companies for which the information could be secured. age 40, for illustration, the non participating rate per $1,000 of whole life insurance was $27.75 in 1860, against $24.76 in 1880, and $26.65 in 1910. it is evident that the earlier rates were too high, while the rates during the middle of the period were too low, so that the present rates may be assumed to represent a more correct approximation to the true mortality rate prevailing among the insured population of the united states. comparative participating premium rates do not permit of an equally accuratc comparison, in that the rates, of course, are materially affected by the payment of subsequent dividends, the amount and proport.ion of which has naturally varied considerably during the half century period at present under review * at age 40 the average participating rate per 951,000 of whole life insurance in 1860 was $31.42, against $31.09 in 1880 and $32.01 in 1910. it is, therefore, shown that the non participating rates are somewhat lower at the present time than fifty years ago, while participating rates are slightly higher. subsequent to the 1egislative investigation of life insurance companies by the state of new york, laws were enacted in several states prohibiting companies from transacting at the same time a participating and a non participating business. required to make a choice of either plan, quite a number of stock companies made a selection of, the non participating plan, which, accordingly, within recent years has been much more generally developed than in former years. information is not available as to the amount of participating and non par ticipating insurance during years previous to 1906, but, in that year, of the companies reporting to the insurance department of the state of new york, 79.9 percent. of the business wa.s on the participating plan and 20.1 percent. on the non par * the most useful data relaling to actual dividends paid by me innuance companies mdng to the form or plan of insurance and including results under deferred dividend policies

annually by the name corn pony. 702 statistical association. c36 ticipating plan. by 1910 the proportion of participating insurance had decreased to 72.9 percent., while the pro portion of non participating insurance had increased to 27.1 percent.* since the amounts considered include industrial insurance, it requires to be pointed out that the two leading industrial companies are both on the non participating plan and the rapid growth of industrial insurance, to a certain extent, accounts for the actual and relative increase in non participating insurance. the details for recent years are given in table xxx, which has been derived from the returns of the new york insurance department. in this connection, it may also be stated that out of 214 companies in active operation on december 31, 1910, 171 were stock companies, while 43 were transacting business on the mutual plan. the total capitalization of the 171 stock companies was $43,446,277 representing an average of $254,072 of capital for each company. the distribution of companies by specified amounts of capital and the total capitalization by groups is given in table xxxi, which has been derived from the “spectator year book” for 1911. in continuation, shows the classification of companies, according to capitalization, paying dividends to stockholders during 1910, or not paying dividends, with the rates of dividends earned, according to size. it is brought out by this analysis that out of 171 stock companies, 105, with a capitalization of $19,603,836, paid no dividends to stockholders during the year. it is further shown that the 66 companies earning dividends paid at the average rate of 8.48 percent., the rate ranging from 6.33 percent., for companies with a capital of less than $50,000 to 9.07 percent. for companies with a capital of $250,000 or over. the amount of dividends paid to stockholders of life insurance companies is accurately known for a long period of years, but only with regard to the companies reporting to the new york insurance department. the rate has varied con *excluding the industrial business, it has been brought out by recent tabulatiom for the year 1910 that 43 companies had $10,134,210,495 of participating ordinary insurance in force. and $1,894,540,901 of non participating ordinary insurance, or, respectively, 84.2 percent. and 15.8 percent. according to a statement in thespecfator for october 12, 1911. 36 companies had w,470.078.408of participating ordi nary insurance on the annual dividend plan, and $4,098,699,510 on the deferred dividend plan. siderably during the last 50 years, a minimum rate of 2.9 percent. having been paid in 1860 and a maximum rate of 11.1 percent. having been paid during 1910. the rate for 1910 was, however, affected by the payment of a stock dividend in the case of one company, transacting a combined life, accident and liabilit,y business. the details of dividends paid on the capital invested by single years since 1860 are given in table xxxii, which has been derived from the “spectator year books” for 1910 and 1911. it is a matter of regret that full information is not available for a larger number of stock companies, but it may be stated that the average interest rate paid on the capital stock of life insurance companies reporting to the insur ance department of new york state has been 7.4 percent. during the last ten years. some of the companies, in fact, are limited by law to a dividend return of only 7 percent., while in some others either the statutory or the voluntary limitation is 10 percent. considering the enormous amount of busi ness transacted, as measured by the total annual income, or the aggregate amount of invested assets, the dividends paid to life insurance stockholders are relatively of no material importance. since in public discussions of the dividends paid to stock holders of life insurance companies the essential facts are often ignored, a few additional tables have been included to empha size the more important considerations, which require to be taken into account. in table xxxiia the data are analyzed according to the length of business experience, with the necessary division as to stock companies paying, and not paying, dividends in 1910. it is shown that 66 companies paying dividends returned to the stockholders on an average 8.48 percent. on the investments, the highest rate being paid by two companies organized during the decade ending with 1880 and for which the rate was 12.83 percent. for 31 companies organized during the decade ending with 1910 the average dividend to stockholders was 5.87 percent., while for 11 companies organized during the decade ending with 1900 the average rate was 6.54 percent. including the 105 com panies with a capital of $19,603,836 not paying dividends to stockholders during 1910, the average rate of interest paid on the total capitalization of life insurance companies during 1910 was only 4.66 percent. a further classification of the companics is made in table xxxiib, showing the distribution of the companies accord ing to the rate of dividends paid. according to this table only six companies paid dividends in excess of 10 percent. during the year, including one company transacting a life, accident and liability insurance business. the actual and relative earnings of capital invested in life insurance com panies represent, therefore, only a reasonable compensation for the amount at risk. in considering the progress made by * life insur ance companies during the past half century, it has not seemed necessary to make allowance in the various statistical tables for the amount of business transacted in canada and other foreign countries. although quite a number of companies transact business in canada, only a small number of canadian companies transact business in the united states. only four companies transact business in other foreign countries than canada and the business results for these companies have been brought together in table xxxiii, which, howevcr, are exclusive of the business trans acted by these companies in canada. the table is for the period 1885 1910 and it is shown that during a quarter of a century the number of policies in forcc in foreign countries other than canada has increased from 54,449 in 1885 to 430, 559 in 1910. it is also shown by the table that a maximum point was attained in 1905 and the subsequent reduction in the amount of insurance in force is partly the result of legislation hostile to companies transacting business in european countries, but largely because of the changes in business methods following the new york legislative insur ance investigation of 1905. with further reference to this mat ter it may be stated that the amount of insurance in force with life insurance companies in foreign countries other than canada was $187,689,531 in 1885, against $1,029,986,802 in marked contrast to the rather unsatisfactory recent development of the life insurance business in foreign countries the business of these companies in canada has increased uninterruptedly from 1885 to 1910. during the 25 year period the number of companies transacting business in canada increased from i2 to 16, the number of policies in force increased from 30,762 to 496,801, the amount of insurance in force increased from $49,440,735 to $217,956, 351, and the premium income increased from $1,723,012 in 1885 to $7,476,859 in 1909. in 1910 fhe premium income was $8,239,485. the results include the industrial business of the metropolitan and prudential, the former company having transacted business in canada for many years. the details by single years are given in table xxxiv. the infor mation has been derived from the annual reports of the cana dian insurance department.* the amount of insurance transacted in the united states by foreign life insurance companies is relatively small, for in 1910 there were only six such companies in active operation, including one transacting exclusively a re insurance business. the available information is for the decade ending with 1910, and the details are shown in table xxxv, in which the certificates of the re insurance company are considered as policies, and the amount of re insurance as insurance in force. according to the table, there were three foreign companies operating in the united states in 1901, having 13,307 policies in force and insuring $19,409,660. by 1910, the number of companies had increased to six, the number of outstanding policies, including re insurance certificates, to 35,052, and the amount of outstanding insurance to $65,568,084. the premium income has increased from $657,813 in 1901 to $1,977,594 in 1910. * the total premium income from canadian businem of all life insursnce companien trmmcbg ' busineas in canada in 1910 waa $29,791,707. of which $8,239.486, or 27.7 percent., wan received hy corn

although somewhat outside t.he scope of the present dis cussion, it has seemed advisable t’o include, for the purpose of convenient comparison, exhibiting the business of fraternal and assessment associations in the vnited states during the period 1885 1010. is not perhaps strictly accurate to refer to the business of these associat.ions as “insurance” in the sense of an exact definit.ion of the term, for the element of absolute securit.y implied in the theory of legal reserve life insurance is necessarily wanting. a discussion of fraternal and assessment insurance is subject the further and serious disadvaiit.age that the ret.urns are more or less untrustworthy, in that stat.ut.ory requiremenh concerning annual reports to insurance departrnenh and methods of official supervision and control have never been as rigid with respect to the business of fraternal and assessment associations granting insurance certificates as in the case of legal reserve life insurance companies issuing policies adequately protected by law. it is, therefore, with much diffidence that pub1icity is given to the available results, but subject to a necessary attitude of caution, the data are of considerable interest and value. it is shown by the table referred to that the number of organizations transacting so called fraternal or assessment insurance and differentiated fraternal orders, assessment life associations and stipulated premium companies has changed from 139 in 1885 to 817 in 1909. it is, however, safe to assume that the actual number of such organizations is much larger. the number of certificates in force has increased from 714,356 at the beginning of the 25 year period to 8,842,766 at the end. the amount of insurance in force has increased from $1,484, 224,883 in 1885 to $9,672,910,261 in 1909. recalling that the total amount of ordinary and industrial insurance in force on december 31, 1909, was $15,480,721,211, the present posi tion of fraternal and assessment insurance is by no means an un important one. it is hardly necessary on the present occasion* to emphasize further than has been done the fundamental difference between legal reserve life insurance, which requires *for a suggestive discussion of the fraternal beneficiary corprat.ions doing business in massachusetts. the accumulation of necessary reserve and surplus funds to absolutely secure to the policyholder the ultimate fulfillment of all outstanding contractual obligations, and so called fra ternal or assessment insurance, which aims rather to provide insurance protection at lowest current cost, without adequate security for the ultimate fulfillment of policy obligations fall ing due in years to come. the large number of associations is in itself an element of danger, in that the required skill and experience in management in the case of many of these with a small membership is necessarily wanting, but it is still more unfortunate that the past record of fraternal insurance should be one of failure and disaster on the part of countless institu tions which have gone out of existencc, to the serious disap pointment and loss of those who are most in need of adequate protection at death or in old age. the interests involved are of such far reaching social and economic importance that more effective methods of state supervision and control are imperatively demanded, and the present tendency is, fortu nately, in this direction.* among the many problems which have a direct bearing upon the,progress of life insurance in the united states, there is probably not one of greater importance than taxation the subject might have been discussed in connection with the expenditures of life insurance companies, but it has seemed best to present the facts in a separate tabulation, and this has been done in which exhibits the taxation of american life insurance companies during the period 1860 1910. it is shown that the actual amount paid in taxes has increased from $36,084 in 1860 to $12,126,470 in 1909. in proportion to the premium income, the tax rate paid to each $100 received in premiums has increased from $0.82 in 1860 to $2.15 in 1909. ‘the seriousness of the situation which confronts fraternal societies granting insurance certificates in best emphasized in the statement that, out of 689 orders and associations, according to the spectator year book for 1911. the number had been less than five years in active operation as 234, or 34 percent.; the number from five to nine years in operation was 132, or 19.2 percent.; from ten to fourteen yeam there were 100, or 14.5 percent.; from fifteen to nineteen pears there were 79, or 11.5 percent.; from twenty to twenty four years there were 49. or 7.1 percent.; and only 95, or 13.8 percent. of the total number, had been in operution twenty five yeam or more. for an excellent discussion of the present fraternal situation. 8ee the 4nnual report of the commissioner of insurance of the state of wisconsin, part 11. madison, 1911. see a h the annual reporta of the insurance commissioners’ conventions for recent years. in proportion to total income, the rate of taxation has increased from $0.65 in 1860 to $1.62 in 1909. the rate has necessarily fluctuated more or less during the long period of years, but the rates have been highest during the period following the panic and depression of the seventies, the spanish war, when federal stamp taxes were required to be paid by life insurance companies, and the last few years, when, in addition to increasing rates of state taxation, the companies have been burdened with a federal corporation tax. in 1910 the rate was $2.20 to every $100 of premium income and $1.67 to every $100 of total income. the general tendency of the tax rate is decidedly in an upward direction and a further increase must be considered a serious menace to the future interests of life insurance companies and their policyholders. it requires no argument to prove that contractual pecuniary obli gations cannot be subsequently modified in their terms, and that, therefore, the taxation of life insurance interests should be in conformity to the nature of the business and not in apparent defiance of sound principles of economics and public finance. in concluding this review of life insurance progress in the united states during the last fifty years, it has seemed advis able to include a few additional tables, emphasizing present day conditions and of these the distribution of insurance according to the state of domicile is of exceptional interest to the student of life insurance development in the united states. according to the largest number of active life insurance companies in 1909 were located in the state of indiana, while quite a number of states have only one or two companies of local origin. the number of companies, however, is no indication of the amount of business transacted, and while, for illustration, the 20 indiana companies had only 97,650 policies in force, insuring $186,212,266, the 11 com panies organized under the laws of the state of new york had 13,693,610 policies in force, insuring $7,511,225,442. many of the companies in southern and western states have bee11 organized during recent years, following the enactment of restrictive legislation by the state of new york, but, as has previously been pointed out, the actual amount of business 431 life insurance progress. 709 thus far secured is not a matter of material importance. it, of course, is entirely a question of the future as to whether many of the new institutions will prove successful, or, con form to past experience, become amalgamated with companies of earlier organization, or fail, to the serious disappointment of their policyholders. an equally interesting comparison is made in table xxxix, which exhibits the ordinary and industrial insurance in force by states on december 31, 1910. this table exhibits the local business transacted by companies, whether chartered by the states for which the information is given, or whether permitted to do business therein by authority of the respective state insurance dpartments. the information is not conven iently available as regards the total intra state and inter state business of companies by states of domicile, but a large proportion of the business of the principle companies is inter state and only a relatively small proportion is intra state.* the business of most of the smaller companies, particularly those organized within recent years, is largely intra state, but the tendency is constantly towards an enlargement of the field of operation, in conformity to the underlying principle of all insurance, that the best business results are secured from a reasonably wide distribution of risks. according to table xxxix, the largest amount of insurance, both ordinary and industrial, is in force in the state of new york, or $2,564, 749,541, or $281 per capita. the highest per capita is for the district of columbia, which, however, more properly falls within the definition of a city than a state. next to the state of new york, the most important development of insurance has been in the state of new jersey, where the per capita is $265, and the same per capita prevails in the state of massa chusetts. the lowest relative degree of development is met with in the state of arkansas, where the per capita of insurance in force is only $60, followed by mississippi, with $65, and new mexico and texas,t with $68. in the southern states, however, the per capita development is materially affected by the negro population, which is practically uninsurable, and the reluctance on the part of life insurance companies to en courage agency efforts in sections considered more or less unhealthy and other wise unsatisfactory from an insurance point of view. the development of life insurance throughout the united states as measured by the amount of insurance per capita, is of considerable interest, and according to table xl, the insurance per capita has increased from $5.47 in ls60 to $40.69 in 1885 and to $171.98 in 1909. during 1910, on the basis of the revised results of the census, the per capita was $179.14. if allowance had been made for the negro population, of about ten million, the per capita results would naturally have been much higher, since only a very small proportion of the negro population is insured with ordinary and industrial companies, chiefly on account of the excessive mortality rate prevailing among this element of the population. the details of ordinary insurance per capita are given in table xli, according to which the amounts have increased from $5.47 in 1860 to $38.11 in 1885 and to $139.01 in 1909. for 1910 the amount of ordinary insurance per capita was $144.45. the details of industrial insurance per capita for the period 1876 1910 are given in table xlii, according to which the per capita has increased from $2.58 in 1885 to $32.97 in 1909. in 1910 the amount of industrial insurance per capita was $34.69. an instructive statement of the aggregate results of reserve life insurance companies since organization up to december 31, 1910, is given in table xliii, which has been derived from the legal reserve life insurance companies have already received $1.07 for every $1.00 paid in premiums, so that the entire expense of management has been paid for out of interest earnings, rents and income from other sources, which, considering the relatively small average payments on account of life insurance premiums, would to a large extent, not have been accumulated as capital or surplus in any other form. it is one of the most important, though not directly measurable results of life insurance that it fosters systematic and periodical habits of saving, involving, as a rule, small average amounts, of which a considerable proportion would not be saved or set aside or invested in any other form. life insurance, to the extent that it aids in the accumulation of capital, now exceeding $4,000,000,000 of assets and surplus, a11 invested in first class interest bearing securities, advances materially the national welfare and fosters an increase in national wealth. life insurance is also one of the most useful and equitable met.hods of redistributing the wealth of the nation, and by providing adequately and se curely for the economic needs of those who without insurance would often be dependent upon others or the state; it tends persistently to raise the’level of social wellbeing of every ele ment of the population from the poor and fairly well to do to the prosperous and the rich. the progress of life insurance is, therefore, a matter d profound national concern. the present discussion makes available to the student of the subject accurate sta tistical information heretofore practically inaccessible, except to those immediately concerned with the administration and the development of the business throughout the united states. the amount of ordinary and industrial insurance combined is at present increasing at the annual rate of 9.2 percent. the rate of increase is 8.7 percent. for ordinary insurance only, and 11.6 percent. for industrial insurance. in marked contrast, the annual rate of increase in the popula tion of the united states is only 2.1 percent., the rate of increase in the assets of building and loan associations is 5.2 percent., the rate of increase in fraternal insurance is 6.1 percent., of savings bank deposits 7.0 percent., and of total bank deposits 11.1 percent. our exports during the last decade have increased at the annual rate of only 2.5 percent., while our imports have increased at the rate of 8.3 percent. the corresponding increase in our customs receipts has been 4.3 percent. and in the receipts of the post office department 11.9 percent. the amount of money in circulation has increased 5.1 percent. and the bank clearings of new york city 9.7 percent. it is, therefore, shown that the measurable evidences of life insurance progress as emphasized in the foregoing statistical discussion indicate conclusively the preeminent position and satisfactory financial condition of what has not inappropriately been called

Willcox","1908-1939"," of recent years and especially of recent months public opinion and political parties have been aroused, as they have not since the dred scot case, over certain judicial decisions and their relation to the public welfare. one outside both of politics and of law might think it prudent to be silent on this subject. but on a matter of such moment every phase of opinion is entitled to a hearing and we may have faith that “in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.” among that multitude i have heard none claiming to speak for the statistician. believing as i do that this small but growing group has a point of view which deserves attention, i shall venture this afternoon to present and defend their position, as i conceive it. what i have to say may be introduced with a quotation from a distinguished jurist who, in part, it may be, because of his work as a student in natural science and later his teach ing of law at three great universities, has a broader outlook and more familiarity with related fields of thought than is likely to be the lot of the lawyer or judge immersed in the routine duties of an exacting profession. professor pound in closing a recent series of suggestive articles in the harvard law review says: “not a little of the world wide discontent with our present legal order is due to modes of juristic thought and juridical method which result from want of ‘team work’ between jurisprudence and the other social sciences.” the “juridical method” is primarily deductive, deriving conclusions from the principles of the law applicable to the case at bar. philosophical jurisprudence subjects those principles to a critical analysis, discovers the large empirical element they contain, and, by showing how they alter with growing experience and with changes in the implicit political or social presuppositions upon which they are built, under mines that almost religious faith in their permanent social value common among lawyers and judges. but even philosophical jurisprudence, like a great part of economics and of sociology, as exemplified by my distinguished colleague this afternoon, devotes much time to the definition, elucidation, and criticism of terms and conceptions and to deduction from principles, intellectual processes in which the lawyer and the judge are already trained. if the lawyer should turn to economic history and statistics, which are perhaps the most inductive branches of social science, he would find a change in method sharply marked. the contrast between the mental characteristics exercised, on the one hand, in stating legal principles neatly and clearly and applying them convincingly to a given or assumed state of facts, and those exercised, on the other hand, in the patient investigation of the facts as they have been and are is of the widest. for this reason an intelligent and sympathetic com prehension of the methods of ascertaining social fact would be of the first value to a judge as supplementing the somewhat excessively deductive training he usually obtains from his profession. it may be said in reply that the facts are given to the appellate court, that in previous trials they have been admitted or established and that all the judge has to do is to apply his principles. but this statement i am compelled to challenge. the very contrary is often the truth. in the great majority of decisions belonging to the class in dispute the court has by implication, if not by direct statement, passed upon questions of fact so important that if they had been differently viewed the verdict also would have been changed. in other words, my main contention is that many, perhaps most, of the court decisions which have aroused dissatisfaction and criticism have turned on questions of social fact, and fact often imperfectly apprehended or established. in order to avoid controverted matter at the start, i will draw my first illustration from a decision neither made by a court nor arousing any considerable dissatisfaction, that rendered by the anthracite coal strike commission of 1902 03. one claim made before that commission by the union mine workers, the only one with which i am now concerned, was for an increase of 20 percent. in their wages. for this claim the following reason, among others, was assigned: “the rate of wages in the anthracite coal fields is insufficient to compensate the mine workers in view of the dangerous character of the occupation in relation to accidents, the liability to serious and permanent disease, the high death rate and the short trade life incident to this employment.” the commission found and reported that anthracite coal mining “should be classed as one of the dangerous industries of the country, ranking with several of the most dangerous.” no evidence was introduced and i believe no important evidence could then or can now be found regarding the comparative liability of anthracite coal miners “to serious and permanent disease, a high death rate and a short trade life,” and yet these points seem to go to the essence of the miners’ claim. in determining the total death rate and the length of trade life accidents are usually a minor factor. in the eyes of the public and probably in those of the miners they bulk much larger than the facts, if known, would warrant. to show this, let me turn to some foreign statistics, not assuming that they would hold true for pennsylvania, but believing they point to a line of evidence which we sorely need for this country. let us suppose a demand for a 20 percent. increase of coal miners’ wages had been made in england, supported by similar claims, and examine the evidence there available to aid in its solution. during the years 1900 02 figures were carefully gathered showing the death rates from accidents and other causes among nearly half a million coal miners. the figures show that fatal accidents were more than twice as common among coal miners as among all occupied and retired males of like age. thus, if an inference from england to pennsylvania were allowable, the finding of the commission that anthracite coal mining is “one of the dangerous industries ” already well supported by pennsylvania figures seems confirmed. but looking to the death rate from all causes, a much more significant evidence of the length of trade life, the death rate of english coal miners at ages 25 64 was between eleven and twelve percent. below the average for all working males. why does coal mining, at least in england, notwithstanding the frequency of fatal accidents, seem to be a healthful occupation? because the very high mortality from accidents is more than neutralized by the low mortality from certain forms of disease, notably consumption. how far these results would apply to anthracite coal miners in pennsylvania, no one can tell. the second case of which i wish to speak is the well known bake shop case.* the new york law under discussion was one of the earliest statutes restricting the hours of men’s labor. the work of bakers was limited to ten hours a day or 60 hours a week and the statute, although a part of the labor law, was defended and justified as protecting the health of the consumers of bread, or of the bakers themselves. nineteen judges passed upon the statute, ten thinking it constitutional and nine unconstitutional; but, as five of the nine were members of the united states supreme court, the last and binding decision was adverse. from the numerous opinions in the case it is possible to derive this general conclusion. if the occupation of a baker as then followed in the bake shops of cities in new york was so harmful to those engaged in it or through its products was so injurious or menacing to the general health as to invite special legislation, then the statute was an admissible exercise of the police power. but if neither of these conditions was met, the statute was unconstitutional. thus judge parker of the court of appeals wrote: “the published medical opinions and vital statistics fully justify the section under review as one to protect the health of the employees”; and justice vann, defending the same conclusion, wrote: “ i do not think the regulation in question can be sustained unless we are able to say from common knowledge that working in a bakery is an unhealthy employment.” on the other hand, justice bartlett of the same court admitted that the state might regulate the hours of labor in any vocation pursued at the risk of health, but ex pressed his belief “that the occupation of a baker did not fall within that class” and so voted against the validity of the statute; and justice peckham of the united states supreme court in writing the prevailing opinion said: “there can be no fair doubt that the trade of a baker in and of itself is not an unhealthy one to that degree which would authorize the legislature to pass such a statute.” other justices, like harlan and holmes, upheld the statute on the ground that whether the occupation was healthful or unhealthful was a question of fact upon which the court should accept the opinion of the legislature implied in the passage of the law. on the whole, a study of the opinions warrants a belief that the law would have been held constitutional by every one of the judges if either of the following conditions had been met: if the judge had accepted the opinion of the legislature affirming the unhealthful character of the baker’s occupation as conclusive; or if, on independently reviewing the evidence offered in support of that conclusion, he had found it convincing. this decision thus turned on a question of fact. upon that question the evidence cited by the judges consisted of a series of opinions from medical writers and vague references to vital statistics. mulhall’s dictionary of statistics, that bbte noire of careful statisticians, was cited four times. i doubt if any member of this association would hold that the evidence mentioned in the numerous opinions of the judges warranted a confident answer either affirmative or negative to the question, was the occupation of a baker in the cities of new york state a very unhealthful one? if a similar question had arisen in england the answer to it would have been clear and probably convincing, the death rate of bakers 25 64 years of age in 1891 and in 1901 was to the death rate of all males at the same ages as 92 is to 100; in other words, the occupation was somewhat more healthful than the average. during the decade 1890 1900 the death rate of bakers fell, the improvement being greatest in the case of consumption and diseases of the.respiratory system. whether similarly a low death rate and rapid improvement in the health of bakers in this country or in new york state would appear, if the facts were known, no one can safely assert. the even division of the judges arose largely from the circumstance that most of them felt bound to reach a conclusion of fact when the evidence was inconclusive and about equally balanced. the third and last case of which i wish to speak is the one in which the new york court of appeals last year unanimously held the workmen’s compensation act of 1910 unconstitutional.* the statute was based upon a classification of occupations under which eight especially dangerous kinds of employment were selected for protection by a new system of compensation in case of accident. to this classification no serious objection was raised by the court. the central question decided in this caae, as in the bake shop case, was that the statute was not a legitimate exercise of the police power, that is, “the power of promoting the public welfare by restraining and regulating the use of liberty and property.”i on this point the court said that the statute “does nothing to conserve the health, safety or morals of the employees,” and, elsewhere, that it “contains not a single provision which can be said to make for the safety, health or morals of the employees.” from the context of these passages we may infer that if the court had taken a different view, if it had believed that the statute did make for the safety or health of the employees, it would have decided that the statute was a valid exercise of the police power and constitutional. now the striking thing about these positions of the court, like those in the other two cases, is that they are not conclu sions of law but statements of fact. as such it requires no special training in the law to examine them. the united states is believed to have an extremely high accident rate, but our statistics to confirm or correct the opinion are meager, if not inconclusive. one of the main purposes of the law declared unconstitutional was to. lower that accident rate in those industries as well as to assure compensation. the court seems to assume without giving its reasons that this purpose would not be realized. the general testimony of students of accident statistics in foreign countries, where legislation aiming at the same end has for years been in force, is to the effect that the proportion of accidents to one thousand employees has increased, that the proportion of serious accidents to one thousand employees has been stationary or has decreased but that this decrease, i f it existed, has been offset or more than offset by the ap parent increase of minor accidents. thus an examination by of the accident statistics of germany, austria, and great britain, published in the quarterly publications of our association for last march, concludes that “the progress in the movement for reducing the risk of industry has resulted in distinctly reducing the risk of death or permanent disablement, but has not yet diminished the risk of temporary disablement.* i quote also the statement of m. a. fontaine, the french director of labor, presented a few weeks ago before the international congress on hygiene and demography at washington: “if, in order to eliminate the influence of the increase of the number of workmen, one refers the numbers of accidents to one thousand workmen, it is a p parent that there has been no increase in severe accidents, that the actual danger of the industries has not augmented, but that there is a characteristic and important increase of minor accidents. this change is attributed to the increasing care with which accidents are reported and still more to the legal modifications which influence the workmen to prolong short, temporary disabilities in order to get their remuneration. ”t the usual and probably the correct explanation of this fact in other countries also is that many minor accidents formerly were not reported at all but now are registered. if this explanation be accepted, then the tendency in foreign countries has been towards a real decrease of serious accidents and perhaps towards a real decrease of all, though not of reported, minor accidents. on the same point the opinion of the commission recommending the law appears in the following sentence of its report signed by thirteen of the fourteen members. “it is the opinion of a great many of the employers testifying before us on the subject that the compensation system will have the effect of making the employers more careful and with that we agree, nor does it seem in any way probable that the compensation system would have any effect on making workmen careless.”* this opinion of the commission was in line with evidence showing that under the present system in three eighths of the cases of fatal accidents investigated nothing was paid to the surviving rep representatives of the deceased, in one eighth only the funeral expenses were paid, and in nearly three eighths more the payment was less than $500. in cases of partial disability, temporary or permanent, the proportion receiving no compensation was even higher. this evidence, carefully considered by the commission and presented in its report, seems fully to justify its opinion. if the amount to be paid out by employers for accidents were to be increased several times, as the proposed system would do, the motives leading the employer to try to diminish the number of such accidents would be correspondingly strengthened. the conclusion of the new york commission has been recently supported by that of the massachusetts commission on compensation for industrial accidents. it recommended an elective compensation law and with the new york decision in hand it unanimously rejected the conclusion of that court regarding the effect of such legislation upon the safety and health of employees and reported the following finding: “no one can study the history of this subject in other countries without being impressed by the fact that the operation of compensation laws in several of them has materially reduced the number of injuries in factories and workshops, especially those resulting from machine operation.”t on the basis of this experience as well as other evidence, the massachusetts commission added: “under the terms of the new law the employers will realize that it is of the utmost consequence in a financial as well as a humanitarian way to prevent the injury. it is believed that it will be possible to decrease very largely the number of accidents and this aspect of the law is regarded as its most important part.”* the new york court seems to believe that an indirect method of decreasing the number of accidents, namely, by increasing the employer’s pecuniary interest in preventing them, is unjustified. it hardly realizes that in securing social change indirect methods are often the most effective. the opinion of the legislature, also, that the new law would diminish accidents seems to be clearly indicated by its passage of the bill. we have then, upon one side of this issue of fact, the conclusion of statisticians regarding the probable effect of similar laws in foreign countries, the conclusion of the new york commission and the massachusetts commission and the statistical evidence upon which they based that conclusion, and the opinion of the legislature which passed the law, and upon the other, the unanimous decision of the new york court of appeals. another line of evidence also leads to the belief that the decision in question is entitled to scant consideration except from such courts as are bound to accept it as authority. the evidence is rather psychological than statistical, but still it may be sanctioned as supporting the argument that courts are ill adapted to deal with these questions of social fact and that a speedy development of sound statistical work in this field is of capital importance for courts, judges, and legislatures. if a statute passed in the exercise of the police power is attacked as unconstitutional, the court usually admits the existence of a presumption in favor of its constitutionality. as justice harlan put it in his dissenting opinion on the bake shop case: “if there be doubt as to the validity of the statute the courts must keep their hands off, leaving the legislature to meet the responsibility for unwise legislation.” a court approaching such a question and feeling bound to review the judgment of the legislature might be expected to describe briefly the existing conditions, the evils which the statute was designed to remove, and the changes that had resulted or would result from it, before approaching the discussion of the constitutional objections to the new system. in that discussion an obvious desire to find the law constitutional would be natural. in the present case the opinion begins with a paragraph reciting the facts and praising “the industry and intelligence of this commission.” the second paragraph begins the argumentative part with a most significant sentence : ‘(the statute, judged by our common law standards, is plainly revolutionary.’) on the lips of a lawyer and judge fifty seven years of age the word “revolutionary,” like the word “socialistic,” is a term of reproach or opprobrium and not of argument. with his opening sentence as a clue to the writer’s frame of mind, the following phrases scattered through the opinion gain new meaning: “the radical character of this legislation,” (‘this departure from our long established law and usage,” ‘(this indictment of the old system,” “the new statute is totally at variance with the common law theory,” “the theory is not merely new in our system of jurisprudence but plainly antagonistic to its basic idea.” from these pas sages one not familiar with the law would be almost sure to infer that there is a strong legal presumption against a “revolutionary” statute “totally at variance with the common law theory.” a careful reading of the decision shows that the court at another point of its discussion grudgingly admits what i take to be unquestioned, that the legislature has the right to revolutionize the common law, if so, the common law no more furnishes any standard by which a statute changing it should be judged, than the decision of a lower court furnishes a standard by which the reversal of its decision by a higher court should be judged. then what is the use of this lengthy discussion of the common law theory? apparently it reveals a frame of mind somewhat like this, the statute is so totally at variance with the common law that it probably violates also some underlying constitutional provision. and to that conclusion the court comes when it says: with all due respect to the members of the commission, we beg to observe that the statute enacted in conformity with their recommendations does not stop at reversing the common law; it attempts to reverse the very provisions of the constitution.” and the court finds it unconstitutional because it is not a health law, or in its own words: “this statute contains not a single provision which can be said to make for the safety, health or morals of the employees.” the evidence already presented seems to indicate that it was a health law in the sense that its intended effect was, and probably its actual effect would have been, to diminish or check the increase in the number or proportion of accidents in the industries affected. these three cases agree among themselves and represent many others in that each tribunal passed upon an important question of fact involved with the questions of law and in so doing decided the case. each was a question of social fact, or fact about a group average, the average duration of trade life, the average healthfulness of an occupation, the average effect of a given method of compensation upon the frequency of industrial accidents. even if the view taken by many judges should finally be accepted by all courts and the decision of these questions of fact made by the legislature in enacting a statute should be left in all but extreme cases without judicial review still the difficulty of drawing a line between these extreme cases and other cases would be no less serious, though it might arise less often. if the court should refrain, the decision of the legislature would be final. if an appeal on such questions of fact from the decision of the state court of last resort to the voters were permitted, as has been proposed, the voters would face the same problem. with whichsoever of these three, legislature, court, or people, the final decision tests, there is great and growing need of perfecting our agencies for ascertaining social fact and of these in my judgment the main one is social statistics. it is the lack of convincing social statistics upon such problems which has made it impossible to answer with confidence many of the questions judges and legislatures have assumed or felt bound to answer. it might be said that the need for statistics is not clear, that the brilliant work of mr. brandeis in defending the oregon ten hour law for women, which illustrates just what is needed, is far from statistical. such work was probably the best that could be done under the conditions, but in many fields it could not be duplicated and like any collection of opinions it is open to challenge as mere opinion. even expert opinion is a poor substitute for an inductive and exhaustive study of the fact. our political mechanism for the inductive determination of social fact is immeasurably inferior to our mechanism for deductive application of legal principles to assumed states of social fact. many courts, wisely or unwisely, have felt bound to review and decide upon such issues of fact and in doing so have often traversed the judgment of the legislature and sometimes of the public and at the same time have revealed a lack of desire or ability to investigate for themselves or do more than weigh the evidence submitted by the parties in the light of their own convictions or impressions. such cases are sure to multiply and the criticism of the courts aroused by their decision seems likely to increase. in such cases a developed system of social statistics should ascertain the facts and present them in a convincing way. it should render upon these multiplying questions of social fact somewhat the service that the jury system does upon questions of individual fact. our methods of ascertaining social fact are on the whole less developed than in any other great industrial country; *more and more our courts are find ing it necessary to decide such questions of fact; our national attitude towards the courts is apparently changing from one of perhaps extravagant laudation to one of perhaps excessive criticism. these facts seem to me to be interdependent. the ascertainment and proof of the social facts should not be left to the individual parties to whatever suit may arise. the facts in the case at bar may be anything but typical and it is by typical, representative, or average facts that the court should be guided to a decision. into this field of exploration our statistics seem destined to advance and by so doing to supplement a defect in our judicial system.

clearly accentuated than now, of problems that reach into the fundamentals of our social and national existence, it may seem rather remote to speak about statistical ideals before an audience of economists and sociologists, containing but a sprinkling of professed statisticians. it would be far fetched were i to indulge in speculations about the ultimate possibilities of a sublimated application of the statistical method. some problem peculiar to the science of statistics could properly be discussed, but it might interest only a few. although being concerned with ideals, i intend to touch upon practical subjects of general importance. economists, sociologists all of us have at least this in common that we require that ground work for theory as well as for practical endeavor which statistics provide. gradually a recognition of this, the universal need of fact bases, is becoming more and more pronounced among us. the statistician welcomes this trend toward finding out the truth about things, instead of fancifully speculating about them, for it marks an approach to the ideals he professes. the general attitude towards statistics, and one perhaps especially characteristic of this country, is curiously paradoxical. we cry aloud for facts; there is a voracious and indiscriminating appetite for figures, or rather for the nourishment they afford to argument and propaganda; statesmen, teachers, preachers, publicists, and men in the street exemplify it. it is a dyspeptic appetite, if you please, because of the ill assorted wares upon which it feeds. on the other hand, there is an almost equally common and more or less outspoken distrust of statistics or of the widespread application of the statistical method as a means of obtaining working knowledge. whether it roots in a lack of appreciation of facts or frequently signifies merely an aversion to the alleged cut and dried, tedious processes by which statistics are evolved matters not. there is a common state of mind in this country which is typified by the remarks of a certain turkish official in a reply to an english seeker after statistical information: ""the thing you ask of me is both difficult and useless. although i have passed all my days in this place, i have neither counted the houses nor inquired into the number of the in habitants; and as to what one person loads on his mule and the other stows away in the bottom of his ship, that is no business of mine. but above all, as to the previous history of this city, god only knows the amount of dirt and confusion the infidels may have eaten before the coming of the sword of islam. it were unprofitable for us to inquire into it. oh my soul! oh my lamb! seek not after things which concern thee not! god created the world and shall we liken ourselves to him in seeking to penetrate into the mysteries of his creation? shall we say behold this star spinneth around that star, and this other star with a tail goeth and cometh in so many years? let it go! he from whose hand it came will guide and direct it!"" one can sympathize with contempt for a useless prying into things that concern us not, which unfortunately marks not a little of so called social. investigation there is much statistical delving which merits ridicule because it simply denotes a stale industry applied to matters that profit no one, an inability to distinguish between essentials and unessentials, or an unwholesome curiosity about the purely trivial. yet the prevalent disrespect for that fact presentation which we call statistics has a deeper cause. it is not solely the too frequent neglect of the wise maxim that only persons of good repute should be permitted to officiate as statisticians, which accounts for low standards in valuing statistics. nor is the trouble only with the inaptitude or unintelligence of the consumers of statistical products. perhaps we shall get closer to the truth by asking, is from sir a. hyard's ""nineveh and babylon."" 31 some statistical ideals. 353 there enough conscientious endeavor to cultivate the science of statistics? let the schools and universities answer. where can one turn, confident of getting competent training as a statistician? i mean not merely a smattering of theory or cleverness in making diagrams, but a training that fits a man for the difficult task of mass observations of fact, so that he is equipped to meet demands in positions of high responsibility in public or private service. it were ungracious to probe far and deep for an answer. we can find a sufficient one in the circumstance that as a rule our professional statisticians are self taught or get their training, which often may be imperfect and one sided enough, by the aid of others whose only school master had been experience. in an exceptional office one may have the good fortune to come under the tutelage of a man of broad views and unswerving high aims, and at least imbibe certain statistical ideals. but this is a rare exception. the incontrovertible truth is that our universities do not take the lead in this respect which rightfully belongs to them. the step motherly treatment generally accorded statistics as a discipline, i need not specify. there are the curricula you know them better than i they speak for themselves. where is the leadership of our schools of learning in actual statistical work? take by contrast a country which is not precisely popular in the united states at the present time, but which at least is giving abundant evidence of marvelous efficiency. one may venture so far as to say that its efficiency rests in no small part upon training in assembling and interpreting facts. in germany, it is the herr professor and doc tor, himself trained in the schools, who directs statistical activities whether at the head of national undertakings or as the principal of municipal statistical bureaus or in other similar capacity. of other countries, france, italy, austria hungary, and many smaller ones, the same is true, if perhaps in a lesser degree. it would be an evasion of the issue to say that our conditions do not afford opportunities of a similar character. the truth is rather that our universities do not provide men to seize the opportunities at hand. at bottom lies the fact that the training is not afforded which fits for leadership. only the unusual man is capable of attaining it without the preliminary guidance which might equip those of lesser native talent. perhaps one reason, but hardly an adequate excuse, for the neglect of statistics in our learned schools is the difficulty of teaching the subject. yet it can be done successfully so as to serve the double purpose of training statisticians and preparing others to become discriminating consumers of statistics. it is an ungrateful task to point out these commonplace grievances; but if we are to speak of ideals it is necessary first to account for some perfectly obvious shortcomings of the present day. the unreasoning attitude many take toward statistical work is all too explicable. the spurious article parading under the name of statistics circulates without let or hindrance. perhaps later on its lack of genuineness may be revealed, but then the mischief is done. it is not merely a question of hunting down these statistical untruths, an almost hopeless chase, but of their effect upon our habits of thought. then there is a singular superstition that anyone, no matter how completely lacking in training, and even ordinary aptitude, may be employed in pretentious statistical undertakings. the schools of learning are not guiltless in this respect, nor are the private organizations that profess a certain leadership. under such circumstances it is hardly becoming to blame severely the appointive powers when they so frequently place men in offices of high responsibility to whom statistics is a meaningless term. it is not open to dispute that, speaking generally, we have a statistical output which is as lacking in quality as it is truly appalling in quantity; that a multitude of so called investigations show still born results; and that other statistical in quiries simply weary the student because they yield nothing worthwhile and therefore fail to instruct. what wonder that there is more or less articulate protest against the waste of time and effort in statistical work, coupled at times with an emphatic condemnation of efforts to pry into affairs that concern us not! why wonder at the prevalent skepticism toward statistical statements, although some of those who exemplify it would by no means be deprived of the opportunity for making such statements! and, lastly, what wonder that the profession of statistics has not quite attained the honorable place in this country which is its right! much of this may sound trite and elementary but mu& be reiterated until better conditions emerge. here, then, are indicated some of the modest statistical ideals toward which we should strive. the basic requirement is that the schools of learning should do their duty in affording a training that will enable men not only to become students of statistics but to engage in the profession of statistics. the demand for qualified workers grows more and more insistent, while efforts to meet it continue to lag. the urgency of the situation is almost too patent for discussion. under the tutelage of the universities as well as of statistical offices of recognized standing, the pretentious tribe of incompetents who bring the very name of statistics into disrepute would be supplanted by trained observers of and earnest seekers after facts. we should no longer witness the distressing spectacle of well meaning but untrained men and women being set at tasks which profit not and spell waste of public and private money. the profession of statistics would attain that dignity and public confidence to which it is entitled. and under the conditions sketched it seems reasonable to expect that the present attitude of the consumer of statistics might be happily modified. he would learn to cultivate an appetite for whole some things and be saved the ills of a statistical indigestion which now only the wary can escape. lastly, there would be put at the disposal of men of the learned professions the material that is so necessary in much of their work. if there is abundant reason in this country to ask forgiveness for statistical shortcomings, there is as ample cause to seek for wisdom and intelligence in order to do much needed work well. to enumerate all of it would be tedious and a repetition of the fairly obvious. i will, however, venture one suggestion. we must learn to show greater patience in acquiring elementary facts in the wide domain of statistics. this is one of the greatest needs; the refinements can wait. our proneness to reason and act, through legislation and otherwise, upon insufficient fact bases, to make a fetish of theories without subjecting their value to the simplest test, do not make for intelligent progress, no matter what political or social problem is involved. passing by the wide fields of fact which need to be industriously explored, i wish to direct your special attention to the question of organization for statistical efficiency. without doubt a large part of the existing confusion, and the uncoordinated and often disappointing results of much statistical work are to be sought in defects of organization. i am of course here referring chiefly to official statistical offices, and am not concerned with details but with certain general principles. let me illustrate by an example. the tremendous statistical machinery operated by the federal government is known to us all. its growth has been somewhat haphazard; the parts do not all fit; there is duplication of work, unnecessary friction, and waste. in short, it is not the effective engine it should be and can be made. various reasons may be as signed for this. statistical offices are sometimes filled with an eye to politics rather than to fitness; proven ability may not lead to promotion or adequate compensation. but far more vital has been the absence of a competent guiding hand in shaping the activities to be set in motion. the situation demands improvement. and the means? let us assume that there were created by congress a central statistical commission composed of the heads of government departments and bureaus that have important statistical work to do, reinforced by a specified number of men drawn from societies like the economic, sociological, and statistical associations, the actuarial society, and perhaps other learned organizations, and with other members adequately representing the professions of medicine and law and special branches of learning like biology. assume also that such a commission be given adequate advisory powers to deal with all that pertains to statistical organization, planning, and work within the federal government. ought it not to become a powerful agent for smoothing out defects, raising standards, cultivating the now bare spots in the statistical fields, and thus bring us a little nearer the ideal service? i offer you no new idea. suggestions similar in nature have already been brought to the attention of officialdom. and outside of germany and engiand there is to my knowledge not a single country without a central statistical commission upon which uniformly men of the highest distinction and attainment are known to serve. i cannot find any valid reason for believing that we should fail if the experiment were tried. that anyone among us should refuse the honorable place upon such a commission is unthinkable. but unless the impulse toward its establishment comes from us, we shall expect it in vain. hitherto we have as a body largely been content with fault finding, which has had its uses, no doubt, but of course has lacked constructive force. the stake is too large to permit us any longer to remain outside as passive critics. we have a duty and cannot divest ourselves of responsibility. the principle of participation in official statistical work, just alluded to, is as applicable to state and municipal activities as to those of the federal government. at least in some states there are men and institutions sufficiently qualified to exercise an advisory leadership in statistical undertakings which too often miss fire for want of it. just now, for instance, several states are preparing for censuses. whether their results will measure up to expectations should be our concern from the moment of the first preparation for the work. here and there are signs of a new feeling of responsibility in these things, but concerted action is still wanting. has not the time come to organize for it? i address this question chiefly to members of the statistical association, but also to the economists and sociologists. i am conscious of having taken the unwelcome part of a critic, that i have dwelt on somewhat obvious elementary conditions and needs, perhaps with a tinge of preachment. probably i shall be forgiven for the sake of those still unattained ideals which we all profess and toward which, i trust, we are slowly moving. in germany, many of the different competent statistic organizations more the empire brought them into closer confederation. the imperial statistical office largely supplies the need of a central commission. the annual meeting of the american statistical association, held in boston, february 13 and 14, 1914, took the form of a special celebration of the seventy fifth anniversary of the organization of the association in this city in 1839. the association was founded by serious minded men for a serious purpose, and this celebration was so planned and carried out as to fittingly exemplify the ideals of the founders and the well established traditions of the association. three sessions were devoted to the discussion of the progress of statistical science and statistical achievement during the period covered by the existence of the association, and of the present status of such work, particularly in the united states. it would be impossible to adequately present in a brief summary the substance of this discussion or even the conclusions of the authors of the several papers. some of these papers appear in this number of the quarterly publications and the rest will be printed in subsequent numbers or in the memorial which is to be prepared in commemoration of this event in the history of the association. it was a source of gratification to the members of the association to learn that the association is not only almost as old as the science of statistics, but that it has had no little part in shaping and promoting the wonderful development of statistical work during that past three quarters of a century. the meetings were not devoted exclusively to business and serious discussion. considerable opportunity was afforded for social intercourse among the members and guests at the headquarters, in the hotel copley plaza, and the final session took the form of a banquet at the Algonquin club, which was attended by a larger number of ladies than had been present at the other sessions. the extent of the interest aroused by this meeting is manifested in the unusually large attendance of members. there were over one hundred present, many of them coming from a considerable distance. in addition to members the following official representatives of other associations and institutions of learning were in attendance",136,21.3235294117647,4.96068965517241,0.353448275862069,2900,1025,17.1514178498986,12.1514178498986,100,2.19871305548178,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15225445.1915.10503630"

Dana Durand","1908-1939","the greatest phenomenon of recent times is the present european, war. that war is, in considerable measure, the outgrowth of present or anticipated pressure of population upon means of subsistence. the problems which are most seriously engaging the attention of the present federal administration are the maintenance of our rights as a neutral nation, the increase of armament, the expansion of export trade, and the improvement of rural credit facilities. all four of these problems arise largely from population growth. though economists and sociologists very generally recognize that increase in population brings serious problems in its train, the same is by no means true of the great majority of the people. even though little that is new can be said on the subject, its vital character makes repetition and emphasis from time to time desirable. one of the most striking features of modern history has been the rapid increase in the numbers of the white race, or what may be called the european stock. the white population of the earth approximately trebled during the nineteenth century. in europe itself the increase has been great, but there has been an enormous overflow into other continents. most of all has the european stock found room for expansion in the united states. but elsewhere in the americas, in australia, in south africa, and in north asia, it has also settled in considerable numbers. no equal period of time ever witnessed such an amazing rate of population growth on such a large scale. this phenomenon of the expansion of the world's white population has been the more remarkable because there occurred at the same time a 1na:kecl advance in the stand are of living of that population. instead of feeling a growing pressure of numbers on natural resources, the european stock enjoyed increasing abundance for the average man. prosperity reigned. people grew to laugh at the gloomy forebodings of malthus as to the effects of population growth. but the past offers n6 guarantee for the future in this respect. the coincidence of enormous increase in numbers with a rising standard of living was due in part to rapid progress in methods of production both in agriculture and in other industries, but in at least equal measure it was attributable to that geographical expansion to which reference has been made. obviously such geographical expansion must ultimately find its limit. already, in fact, the point has been reached where further geographical expansion meets with increasing difficulty. at the beginning of the nineteenth century, a large part of the fertile temperate regions of the earth was still virtually unoccupied. discovery and improvements in transportation brought enormous rich areas suddenly into the service of the european stock. hundreds of millions of acres of excellent land in the united states, in canada, in the argentine, and elsewhere were brought into cultivation by european settlers and their descendants. this new land for the most part was quite as productive as the best of europe itself. geographical expansion of agricultural production for a long time involved no descent to inferior lands with consequent diminishing re turns to labor. within the most recent years, however, the extension of agricultural areas has begun to invade less eligible fields. the temperate regions of the globe, within which only has the white race found it possible to live in large numbers, offer no further prospect of such magnificent additions to agricultural resources as took place during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. it is true that there are in the temperate zone enormous areas of land which are but thinly populated, which are as yet un used or but slightly used for agricultural production. the areas in which there is any considerable density of population are but a small fraction of the total land surface of the earth or even of the land surface of the temperate regions. but the great bulk of these undeveloped lands is seriously handicapped in one way or another. there are vast regions which are entirely desert and only a small fraction of which can ever be reclaimed by irrigation. other great regions are too mountainous or rocky ever to contribute greatly to agricultural production. there remain, to be sure, hundreds, if not thousands, of millions of acres which are more capable of agricultural use, but for the most part even these are decidedly inferior to the better parts of europe and america. they suffer from partial aridity, from cold, from lack of drainage, from poverty of soil, or from unfavorable configuration. very little of the un occupied area of the temperate zone can be compared for a moment with the splendid mississippi valley, for example. broadly speaking, in that zone labor of a given grade of efficiency will hereafter produce less per man with each further geographical extension of agriculture. moreover, apart from the question of production, the comfort of human life in these areas remaining for settlement will in general be much lower than in present regions of large population. consider for a moment the characteristics of some of the largest temperate areas which remain undeveloped. first of all, the united states. only one fourth of the total land area of this country is under cultivation, and less than half is in farms at all. nevertheless, the unused or slightly used lands are either permanently deficient in some of the qualities essential to the best agricultural results, or they require great investment of capital to make them satisfactory agents of production. in fact, such geographical extension of agriculture as has taken place in this country in the last decade or two has for the most part been under distinctly unfavorable conditions. from 1900 to 1910, 64,000,000 acres were added to the im proved farm land of the united states an increase of 15 percent. of this total, 54,000,000 acres, or fully five sixths, were west of the 95th meridian; that is, west of the first tier of states on the further side of the mississippi river. the great bulk of this new uncultivated land was in fact west of the 100th meridian. that meridian marks substantially the limit of normal humidity. west of it, irrigation or dry farming is in most cases necessary ta make land productive. irrigation, save in a few favored localities, requires very heavy investment of capital; the results of the more recent projects have not been altogether encouraging. dry farming gives far less yield per acre per year and usually less production per man than farming under conditions of normal rainfall. the increase of our agricultural production through geographical extension during recent years has been accomplished only at increasing unit cost. great areas in the west and in the north of that country can un questionably be brought under cultivation. but in much of this territory the rainfall is not sufficient to assure the regular production of good crops, and in most of it the cold is a serious handicap both to production and to comfortable living. the life of the farmer in a region where for months the days are exceedingly short and the cold intense often falling to 40 or 50 degrees below zero can hardly be considered a thing of joy. even more unfavorable are the conditions in the vast unsettled areas of siberia. turning; to the southern hemisphere we find a great proportion of argentina, of south africa and of australia cursed with drought. in fact, it is evident that, were there anywhere in the temperate regions large areas of good land still available for settlement, the people of the united states would scarcely be extending their agriculture into regions so ineligible as those where lie the greater part of the recent additions to our own cultivated area. another evidence of the fact that high grade agricultural lands are no longer readily being added to the world’s use is found in the great advance in the prices of farm products and of farm lands, particularly in the united states. grounds appear for the suspicion that in the last decade or two the standard of living of the working classes in this country, other than the farm owners themselves, has ceased to rise, if it has much is expected of the enormous area of Canada. not actually fallen, and that this change in tendency is due essentially to the filling up of our territory. everywhere we hear bitter complaints of the high cost of living. by this is meant, of course, higher cos$ of living, decreased h y in g power of income. prices have advanced rapidly, but advance in prices per se does not mean higher cost of living. it is un equal advance for different classes of commonalities, or disparity between increase of wages and that of commodity prices, which gives real ground for dissatisfaction. the general advance in prices has been due primarily to the increased production of gold. the general tendency of wages and salaries to lag behind commodity prices when the supply of money is augmented, is the source of much of the higher cost of living. but no small part of it, at least in the united states, is due to the fact that agricultural products have risen faster in price than other products. the figures represent average index numbers of wholesale prices, duly weighted, for 1912 and 1913, the base in each case being the average prices for 1890 to 1899. the year 1914, in which prices of farm products were much higher still, is not used because of the possibly abnormal conditions due to the war. the data are compiled from the latest bulletin of the bureau of labor statistics on wholesale prices, in which the methods of computation have been revised and made more scientific. under the heading, “farm products,” in this table are included a number not so classed by the bureau of labor statistics itself but which are placed it in the group of food products. these include eggs, beans, mill; rice, onions, and potatoes, wholly unmanufactured products of strictly farm origin, and also butter, cheese, prunes, currants, and raisins, which, though in a sense manufactured articles, have been subjected to but slight change and that often on the farm itself. most of the articles classed as farm products in this table are used directly or indirectly as human food, but a few, such as cotton, hides, and hay, are used for clothing or other purposes. the remaining articles classed by the bureau of labor statistics as food products have been divided into two groups: the accompanying table brings out the situation. the first includes manufactured articles derived from the products of domestic agriculture, such as flour, bread, meat; the second includes fish, mineral food substances, and imported food products, sugar, tea, coffee, cocoa, spices, etc. this table shows a far greater price advance for domestic farm products than for most other classes of commodities. their average price for 1912 and 1913 was 58 percent. higher than the average for 1890 1899. for manufactured foods derived from domestic farm products, the increase was 42 percent. as might be expected from the rapid exhaustion of our aboriginal forests, the increase for the group of lumber and building materials approaches that for farm products. confirmation of this great advance in the prices of farm products in the united states is afforded by the census of 1910. according to the reports of the farmers themselves, the average increase in the prices of their crops, duly weighted, was no less than 66 percent. between 1899 and 1909. a comparison of the movement of wages with that of retail prices of food yields similar results. such a comparison can be made only with difficulty; but in a recent careful analysis of the data of the bureau of labor statistics, has reached the conclusion that in the short period from 1907 to 1912 the purchasing power of an hour's wages, expressed in cost of foods, decreased about 10 percent., and that for a considerable number of years before 1907 there had been no advance in such purchasing power. the extraordinary advance in the prices of farm products has naturally caused a still greater advance in the price of land itself. anticipating still further increases in earning capacity, holders of land have marked up its price by leaps and bounds. from 1900 to 1910 the average value of farm land per acre in the united states as a whole advanced by no less than 108 percent. in some of the best agricultural states like illinois and iowa, farm land values rose even more rapidly. no doubt to use the extraordinary relative advance in prices of agricultural products and of land in the united states since the nineties as a measure of the increase in pressure of population on agricultural resources in the area of european settlement generally, would involve exaggeration. the middle nineties were years of abnormally low prices for farm products in this country. the imperfect data available for european countries show much less disparity in movement between the prices of agricultural and those of other commodities than the data for the united states. however, the prices of farm products in this country in recent years are not higher than during the nineties; they are the highest in gold ever known. moreover, whatever may have been the movement of prices elsewhere and whatever the increase in the production of agricultural staples in the world as a whole, the filling up of the lands of the united states and the rapid advance in prices of agricultural products here can scarcely fail to indicate the near approach of a time when, for the world in general, pressure of population on agricultural resources can no longer find ready relief in geographical expansion. the united states represents a large fraction of the temperate zone and conditions here cannot but reflect themselves elsewhere. thus far, in discussing the future geographical expansion of agriculture, reference has been made only to the temperate zone. while a considerable part of the tropical zone is desert. there are large areas which are fertile and capable of great agricultural production. tropical asia and oceania are densely peopled, so densely, in fact, that they have often suffered from famine, but the tropical regions of america and africa are sparsely settled. the question arises, therefore, whether a large further expansion of the white population of the world may not find its food supply in these regions. it is a well known fact that hitherto the white race has found the climate of the tropics an all but complete bar to permanent residence. the inhabitants of the tropics consist almost exclusively of colored races or of persons of mixed blood. save only in asia and some of the adjacent islands, these colored inhabitants of the tropics have, whether by reason of the pressing influence of the climate or otherwise, failed to develop much efficiency or to subdue in any appreciable degree the exuberant forces of nature. it is conceivable that scientific progress and large investment of capital may enable the white race so to modify conditions in the tropics as to permit its members to dwell there in large numbers. the clearing of forests and the drainage of lands would much mitigate the injurious effect of the tropic heat. could a large population of intelligent people maintain its efficiency in the now thinly settled tropics, it could ably make them produce abundantly. at the same time, it must be recognized that the difficulties are great and that, at least for a long time to come, the prospects of such white settlement of the tropics are scarcely promising. it has been suggested by some that the solution of the problem of utilizing the fertile tropics is to be found in developing there a large colored population under the direction and super vision of the whites. the success of the dutch in the management of java is often cited as an evidence of the possibilities of large production through colored labor in the tropics generally. in order that such a colored population should work assiduously and produce a surplus for exportation to the temperate zone, something more or less approaching slavery would apparently be necessary. labor in java is virtually compulsory, though of course it is free from the abuses of complete enslavement. the white race can scarcely look forward with entire satisfaction to the prospect of having its increase in numbers depend upon the exploitation of colored peoples in the tropical zone. we must conclude, then, that geographical expansion of agriculture ‘in the future, whether in the temperate or the tropical regions of the earth, is likely to confront far greater difficulties than during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and that such difficulties will constantly become more serious. it is urged, however, that scientific progress will permit a great increase in agricultural production and thereby furnish the means for a continuance of the growth of population. no doubt much is to be expected from scientific progress. it will help to render available lands which are now unsuited to efficient agriculture. it will do much to increase the yield per acre of lands already in use. moreover, the improvement in productive processes in non agricultural industries may, by setting free labor to turn to the soil, serve to increase the out put of food. but have we any right to assume that such progress will be sufficiently rapid to permit population to grow at the present rate and still advance its standard of living? is it not usually the case that the earlier inventions and discoveries in science, art, and industry are relatively more important economically than the later? can scientific seed selection and plant breeding, proper rotation of crops, efficient maintenance of soil fertility, or all the other improvements in agricultural methods which are now being studied and inculcated accomplish more for agriculture in a given length of time than did the introduction of horse drawn and automatic machinery for planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops during the nineteenth century? we are sometimes misled into undue optimism as to the possibilities of agriculture by knowledge of the fact that in certain parts of the world enormously greater yields per acre are obtained than is the case elsewhere. we know, for instance, that the yields of the standard grains are twice as high in western europe as in the united states or canada or argentina. we know that in china and japan the cultivation of a single acre often supports a family. we are too likely to overlook the fact that a large part of the excess in productivity is due to greater application of labor and only a much smaller part, if any, to superior methods. the output of each tiller of the soil is usually less in regions where the production per acre is high than where it is low. intensive agriculture constantly bumps up against the law of decreasing returns. it may be, of course, that the improvement in methods of production will be not slower hut faster in the future than in the past. we have, however, no right to assume that such will be the case. a nation, like an individual family, is rash which multiplies its numbers in the blind confidence that “the lord will provide.” it is easily possible for population to outstrip agricultural production. should the area of european settlement ever become as densely inhabited as china or india, it could hardly fail to mean a much lower standard of living than we now enjoy. if a continuance of the present rate of population growth of the european stock as a whole portends the possibility of lower living standards, how much more must this be true of countries already so densely populated that they must rely on other lands for much of the necessaries of life? several european countries have reached this stage. further growth in their population with maintenance of present living standards is possible only by increasing dependence on imported foods and raw materials. a large part of the enormous increase in international trade in recent decades has been due to the exchange of manufactured products of such countries for the raw products of less densely settled regions. the great economic problem of england, germany, belgium, and even france is usually expressed as the problem of finding markets for their surplus manufactures. this is but a euphemistic manner of $laying that their problem is to find outside sources of food and other essentials. the search for those to whom to sell is really the search for those from whom to buy. if present rates of population growth continue, other countries must one by one be added to the ranks of those dependent on outside sources for necessaries of life. this process of building up population on the strength of resources somewhere else cannot go on forever. when enough nations have come to rely on the outside world for means of subsistence, there will be no outside world. there is danger that the end of the rope may be reached with a certain degree of suddenness. from what lands can any great increase in supplies of food and other necessaries for the leading manufacturing countries be expected? certainly not from the already overcrowded countries like india or china. for some time to come the more thinly settled regions, despite the handicaps under which most of thein suffer, will doubtless have increasing surpluses of agricultural products to export. but these regions are rapidly filling up. sooner or later they will require most if not all of their agricultural products to support their own population. increasingly, moreover, they will come to manufacture their own more advanced commodities and there will be a consequent reduction in the demand for imports of manufactured articles. indeed, the capitalists of the great industrial nations are themselves hastening the extinction of export markets by investing capital in factories and other industrial enterprises in the more thinly settled countries as well as in countries like china and india. some day the great manufacturing countries are likely to be thrown back upon their own agricultural resources resources which could not even support their present population without a serious decline in the standard of living. the increasing dependence of certain nations on outside sources of food and other necessaries is a fertile seed of international discord. it is largely because of such dependence that england and germany are today grappling in desperate conflict. a nation that is primarily devoted to manufactures and that can maintain its standard of living only by exporting them largely in exchange for food and materials naturally seeks to secure to itself exclusive sources of supply or, in the more common phrase, exclusive markets for its products. it looks with jealousy and fear upon the growth of the trade of another industrial nation with such sources of supply. pressure of population in a crowded nation results in constant and strenuous efforts to control markets. it is all but inevitable that this industrial and commercial struggle should ultimately result in war. nations which find themselves dependent on outside sources for necessaries of life are naturally disposed toward great armaments. the navy of england, the army of germany, represent the effort to protect their sources of supply. they result from the desire to permit a steady increase in population without a fall in the standard of living. indeed, there is a vicious circle in the policy of these nations. germany, for example, wishes greater population that she may have more soldiers; she wishes more soldiers that she may expand her foreign trade and her territory; she wishes more foreign trade and more territory to support an increasing population. the sphere of woman, says the german kaiser, is expressed in the four k’s with emphasis on the kinder. in the dependence of england and germany on the outside world lies, too, the explanation of those violations of previously established principles of international law which have aroused such bitter complaint from our own country and other neutrals in the present war. in days when each belligerent was able to provide itself from within with food and necessaries of civilian life, it was natural that the list of contraband should be confined essentially to articles designed primarily for military use. no important effect on the results of the war could be secured by a wider extension of the list of contraband. now conditions have so changed that to shut off sources of supply for an entire population may mean victory over the enemy. under these circumstances belligerents can scarcely be expected to refrain from seeking that object or from adopting hitherto unaccustomed and unsanctioned means to accomplish it. the old rules of international law are hardly likely to be obeyed when the whole economic situation of belligerents is new. the united states is already approaching the gateway of the path which england and germany are treading. she is becoming primarily a manufacturing nation. the great decline in our exports of agricultural products and the great increase in our exports of manufactures are striking evidences of the change that is going on. prior to 1900 we had been exporting over one third of our wheat crop. for the three years ending 1912, the proportion was less than one eighth. fresh beef, which had furnished a large fraction of the consumption of the united kingdom at the beginning of the present century, wholly disappeared from foreign markets only a decade later. the exportation of cured meats fell off greatly. in the last two or three years the united states has itself been importing considerable quantities of fresh meat from argentina. it is true that during 1914 and 1915 exceptionally favorable weather conditions resulted in very large grain crops in this country and that our exports of agricultural products, stimulated by the unusual demand, have again increased greatly. there is, however, no reason to suppose that this condition will continue. meantime our rapidly increasing population has devoted itself more and more to elaborative industries. our exports of manufactures have increased by leaps and bounds. most boast of these changes. the politician has become accustomed to gauge the progress of the nation by the growth of manufactures and of exports of manufactures. up to a certain point it was in fact an advantage to our country to develop in this direction. so long as growth in manufactures served to free us from dependence on older nations for the more advanced commodities, so long as it served to increase the variety and raise the quality of articles of consumption, it was most beneficial. so long as expansion in export trade served to bring us a greater range of imports and to place at our service things which our own land is incapable of producing, that expansion was advantageous. but that which is up to a certain limit a gain may become an injury when once the limit is passed. we are rapidly approaching the time when me shall find it necessary to export manufactured commodities in order to supply ourselves with those very essentials of life which we have been accustomed to produce in abundance. if population in the united states continues to increase at the present rate and continues, as at present, to devote itself more and more to manufacturing industries, we shall soon become dependent on the outside world in the sense in which england and germany are dependent. we shall be threatened as they are threatened with a decline in the standard of living due to the possibility, if not the probability, of the drying up of outside sources of supply. we shall be drawn into trade conflicts which will threaten our peace. our statesmen are already turning their attention toward policies which indicate a sense of impending pressure of population on agricultural resources. they are beginning to talk of the necessity of finding wider markets for our manufactured products if labor is to be kept steadily employed. we are urged to take advantage of the disturbance of the foreign trade of the warring nations to strengthen our grip on the markets of south america, of africa, of asia. various measures of governmental aid in the extension of markets and in the transportation of products to them have been taken or are now under consideration. it is being urged that combinations and trusts which in internal business would be unlawful should be permitted and even fostered for export business. i am merely urging that we give serious consideration to the conditions and tendencies which lie back of them. if we cannot change the direction in which we are going, we should at least know what that direction is. we should not pride ourselves in pursuing a path which leads into danger. the disastrous effects of overcrowding of population are not likely, under the institutions and laws existing in our country and in most other countries of european settlement, to be equally felt by all classes in the community. on the contrary, as long as natural resources are allowed to remain without restriction in private ownership, growth of population tends greatly to increase the disparity of wealth. it plays into the hands of owners of land and other natural resources. it is those that have no share in the ownership of resources whose standard of living is threatened. it is a familiar truism that increase of population creates economic rent, monopoly value, unearned increment. in the early days of the single tax agitation in the united states stress was laid chiefly upon the injustice of leaving in we shall feel forced to maintain great armaments. i am not quarreling with any of these policies. private hands the unearned increment of urban land, of mineral land, of water power, of railroads, and of similar forms of property. it was maintained that the greater part of the value of agricultural land, at least in the united states and countries of similar character, was not inherent in the land itself, but was a creation of the labor and capital of the farmers which should, according to these exponents of the doctrine, be free from taxation. within the last decade or two this situation has changed. economic rent for farm land in huge amount has emerged in the united states. a new agricultural problem has arisen as the direct result of growth of population. reference has already been made to the extraordinary $increase in land values in the united states in recent years. without increasing in any way his labor or his investment of capital, without adding in the slightest to the quantity of products raised, the owner of farm land in the better agricultural sections might see his income rise immensely by reason of the advance in the prices of agricultural products. fortunately in this country the great bulk of the agricultural land is held by relatively small owners and five eighths of it by those who actually till the soil. the enormous un earned increment of land value has thus been widely distributed. yet to the still more numerous landless class it is no great comfort that several millions have shared in that increment. a certain amount of the increment of land value may properly enough in a new country be allowed to go to the pioneers and their immediate offspring. it is a fitting reward for initiative, compensation for hardship, stimulus to development. but in many parts of the united states the time has already arrived when justice to the landless classes demands that a large part of any future increment in the value of farm land should, by taxation or otherwise, be taken for general public use. confiscation of values already existing would doubtless cause undue hardship and be unjust to recent purchasers, but further increments in the value of already valuable lands should no longer go to any single class. a result of the unearned increment of farm land in the united states is that a rapidly increasing proportion of the land is no longer cultivated by owners. tenancy has assumed large proportions and is steadily advancing. so long as farm land commanded but little economic rent the owner, unless his tract was decidedly large, had to contribute his own management and physical labor to obtain a living from it. today in many cases he can afford to live in idleness, to reap what others sow and tend. in the united states as a whole 26 percent. of the farms were operated by tenants in 1880, 28 percent. in 1890, 35 percent. in 1900, and 37 percent. in 1910. even more significant, however, are the data for the northern sections of the country. the problem of tenancy in the south, profoundly serious as it is, is in part a relic of slavery days. in the east north central division, the proportion of tenant farms increased from 20 percent. in 1880 to 27 percent. in 1910; in the west north central, from 20 percent. to 31 percent. these are our best agricultural sections. in illinois and iowa, the banner farming states, tenants in 1910 formed 41 and 38 percent., respectively, of the farm operators. in one illinois county out of five more than half of the farms are tenant farms. while in a good many cases present farm tenants are sons or sons in law of retired farm owners and may themselves later become owners, nevertheless a distinct tenant class is rapidly developing. the tenancy problem is essentially the result of population growth. it is in no small measure the increase of tenancy that has given rise to the present agitation for better facilities of rural credit. except in newer and poorer agricultural sections, farm owners already enjoy reasonably satisfactory conditions of credit. they can borrow all they want at fairly moderate interest rates. it is very commonly stated that the real problem in the better agricultural sections is to devise means by which the tenant, the hired farm laborer, the immigrant, or the city dweller can obtain enough credit, at sufficiently low rates, to enable him to acquire and equip land. unfortunately in large parts of our country no such means can be devised, for the problem is only half a credit problem. the most ideal credit facilities would not alone suffice to the figures as to tenancy are familiar enough. enable the landless to buy high grade land. the price of the land is too high and will remain too high so long as the unearned increment goes to the owner. anticipating further advance in the price pf farm products, the owner of agricultural land holds it at a figure such that its present output at present prices must necessarily be insufficient to give living wages to the farm operator and a normal rate of interest on the value of the land. it is very generally the case that the present earning capacity of the higher priced lands is only 2 or 3 percent. of the value at which they are held. the farm owner capitalizes the present earning capacity at say 5 or 6 percent. and then doubles the capitalization in anticipation of future advance in earning capacity. the poor man cannot afford to be a land speculator. he cannot buy and wait for an advance in earning capacity. he must pay interest on the cost of his land out of current earnings. better credit facilities alone would do little to help him. in fact a probable result of a material reduction in interest rates on land loans would be further to advance the price of farm land. owners would very likely capitalize earning capacity on the basis of the lower rate. the landless man would therefore be substantially in the same position as before. it was not without reason that the national conference on rural credit held at chicago in december, 1915, included in its resolutions a recommendation that, in connection with any new system of rural credit, steps should be taken to prevent it from causing further advance in land values and inuring to the benefit of land speculators. unless we properly attack the problem of unearned increment a further increase in farm tenancy in the united states is bound to occur. not only so but it is highly probable that the ownership of farm land will become increasingly concentrated and the economic rent more and more go to limited numbers of persons. it has ever been the case that monopoly values tend to be absorbed by the relatively few. when our multimillionaires come to realize the possibilities of unearned gain through farm land ownership, they will more and more seek control over such land, and their enormous resources will enable them to acquire wide reaching control. only passing reference may be made to the effects of increase of population in creating other forms of unearned increment. in the last decade or two there has been in the united states an immense addition to the value of urban land; of deposits of iron ore, anthracite coal, the better grades of bituminous coal, petroleum, copper, and other minerals; of water powers, forests, and similar limited natural resources. the great bulk of this unearned increment of value has been permitted to remain in private hands, and unfortunately in a very much smaller number of hands than in the case of farm land. further additions to the value of these resources are bound to occur with further growth of population. in the case of railroads and to some extent in the case of other public service enterprises, public regulation has checked materially the unearned increment due to population growth or, to put it more accurately, has taken that unearned increment in whole or in part for the public generally. charges have been reduced or have been prevented from advancing in proportion to increase in operating expenses due to the generally higher level of prices and wages. had there been no such rise in operating expenses, the railroads, for example, would, on the basis of an unchanged level of rates, have seen their profits enormously swelled during the past 15 or 20 years. the volume of traffic has grown very much more rapidly than the additions to investment. the more or less accidental fact of general advance in the level of prices and wages has enabled the people to absorb the unearned increment of the railroad business merely by holding rates substantially to the previous level. it seems to me of fundamental importance that we in the united states should radically change our attitude toward growth of population. so long as we had vast resources scarcely scratched, rapid growth in population was eminently desirable. the scattered settlers in a new and rich country find their well being distinctly promoted by the growth of numbers. but the pride in population growth and the desire for it engendered by such primitive conditions tend to persist after the conditions have utterly changed, and undoubtedly exercise a considerable influence in actually stimulating increase in population. further growth at the present rate threatens to lower our standard of living, to increase our dependence on other lands, and to widen the already perilously wide gulf between rich and poor. the rate of growth of population tends to adjust itself to resources. where population is already overcrowded and the standard of living low, famine and disease must increase. in a population with a high standard of living a voluntary restriction of the birth rate tends to take place whenever pressure on resources is felt. indeed, such restriction of birth rate may be practiced with deliberate intent actually to raise the standard of living. in this country this salutary tendency is, unfortunately, checked in some measure by that unreasoning pride in population growth to which reference has been made. too often, moreover, both here and elsewhere, it is opposed by rulers and by leaders of thought and sentiment. the underlying motive of those who favor a high birth rate is usually the desire to increase military strength. sometimes it finds support on supposed religious or ethical grounds. sometimes the propaganda for a high birth rate is directed only to the middle and upper classes, who do, in fact, too often restrict their numbers unduly. the trouble is that those for whom the incitement to multiply is not intended are more apt to be influenced than those at whom it is aimed. indeed, the danger of undue population growth lies largely in lack of prudence in respect to birth rate on the part of the poorer and less intelligent classes in the community. the effect of a high birth rate among such classes in increasing population is less subject to check by a high death rate in advanced countries than in semi civilized countries. our modern feeling of sympathy and our public and private donations for relieving distress protect the less prudent against the consequences of their multiplication in numbers. in our own country the natural growth of population is greatly augmented by immigration. had there been no immigration from 1900 to 1910 our population would have increased about 14 percent. as it was, it increased 21 percent. immigration accounted for one third of the addition to our numbers. moreover, of the natural increase in the population a disproportionate share was attributable to the presence of the foreign born, of earlier migration. with their lower standard of living they have larger families than the older native stock. if the admission of multitudes of foreigners to our shores served to relieve the pressure of population in the countries whence they came, we might at least congratulate ourselves upon a philanthropic action in opening wide our doors. as a matter of fact, it seems likely that the possibility of sending surplus population elsewhere tends to stimulate the birth rate in those countries. the policy of the united states and of various other nations in failing to restrict immigration, or even encouraging it, probably increases the rate of population growth in the world as a whole. however that may be, it is hard to be patient with those who believe that further large immigration will be beneficial to our own country. we no longer have a great over plus of unused resources clamoring for development. it is {principally into the manufacturing industries that present day immigrants are entering. hardly an eighth of the foreign born added to our population during the last census decade went upon the land; the great bulk of them crowded into our cities. the flood of immigration is simply hastening the time when we shall become dependent on the outside world for the very means of subsistence, when our standard of living will fall, when we shall be forced into militarism, when the masses of our people will be virtually the serfs of the few owners of natural resources.

Young","1908-1939","our national participation in the war has brought with it an enormous demand for prompt and exact statistical information. such a demand is, of course, an inevitable accompaniment of a war waged under modern conditions. war has come to be a conflict of directed masses, of aggregates. men, money, munitions, food, railways, shipping, raw materials, and manufactured products in great variety are impressed into the service of the nation. the problems of the effective control and use for war purposes of these varied national resources is intimately dependent upon a knowledge of their quantities, that is, upon statistics. like chemistry, physics, and the applied sciences, statistical knowledge aid the statistical method have come to be important tools of modern warfare. just as this war is our largest national undertaking, so its statistical demands constitute, in the aggregate, the largest statistical problem with which we have had to deal. the statistical activities of the federal government in times of peace cover in the main only those phases of national life which are deemed to be of public and especially of political moment. our census of population is taken primarily to afford a basis for congressional apportionment; our census of manufactures and our foreign trade statistics still bear the marks of tariff controversies, and our federal statistics of wages and prices may be traced back to the same origin. in other fields, as diverse as immigration and railway transportation, our federal statistics are at once a by product of federal control and a guide in the exercise of that control. in the fields of federal finance, money, and banking, our statistics are largely administrative by products. the statistical work of the department of agriculture is a recognition, inadequate as yet, of a public interest which is probably only in small part political, and so with the statistical work of the geological survey and the bureau of mines. the work of the bureau of the census in the field of vital statistics is the most noteworthy example of the recognition of a large social interest which is not primarily either economic or political. thus the federal government, in its statistical work, has touched the current of our national life at only relatively few points, and at some of these only intermittently. for the most this current flows on in its own channels, free from disturbance or questioning or measurement by the government. except to the tax gatherer, a large part of the productive and business activities of the country have not been deemed to be matters of public concern, even as group aggregates. the changes brought by our entrance into the war have been profound. other activities have had to be subordinated to the necessities of the efficient and successful conduct of the war. this subordination, we may well believe, is only imperfectly realized as yet. if the war continues it is certain that the field of activity over which the public interest will be deemed to extend must be much further widened. our national problem, in its essence, is that of directing our efforts and output into new channels, of focusing all of our national energies on the one supreme task before us. individual desires and whims are no longer masters of our economic life. instead of doing what it is most profitable to do, men are beginning to do, and to do willingly, what they are bidden to do. this new ordering of life works through such diverse forms as the drafting of men, the commandeering of ships and work shops and supplies, the control of prices and output, the restriction of exports and imports, the supervision of the processes of market distribution, the regulation of consumption, the coordination and administration of transportation agencies, the solution of labor difficulties, the raising of vast sums of money through taxes and loans, and the creation of priority rights. the successful execution of such a program calls for a degree of national self knowledge far beyond anything that we might have imagined necessary or possible in the past. we have been suddenly thrust into a situation in which we find our selves in urgent need of a complete inventory of our national assets and a complete record of our productive activities. in this need we find the explanation of that enormous demand for prompt and exact statistical information to which i have ref erred. in this emergency we turned first to our existing stocks of statistical information and to the current statistical output of our government bureaus, and have realized, perhaps for the first time, how woefully incomplete and inadequate our federal statistics are. with our latest population figures seven years old, our latest statistics of manufacturing output three years old and it is surprising to find how antiquated and how useless for present purposes this latest manufacturing census is and with no information whatever respecting important fields of trade, we were in a state of statistical unpreparedness. under these conditions a war statistical service had to be improvised. with no centralizing and coordinating agency at work, the boards and commissions created to take charge of the various fields of war work have had to procure for themselves, as best they could, the statistical information needed for their purposes. in part, it is true, these inquiries have taken the form of assembling information furnished by other organizations, and more especially by the permanent statistical offices of the government. but there is scarcely a war board or commission in washington that has not had to make independent statistical investigations of its own, involving the collection, tabulation, and analysis of necessary facts. in many instances this work has been of sufficient magnitude to lead to the organization of separate statistical bureaus or divisions within these war organizations. a few of these rival in the size of their staffs and of their statistical output the larger of the permanent statistical offices. i shall not attempt to describe in any detail the work of these new statistical agencies. hurriedly organized, con fronted by really formidable tasks and by the necessity of getting quick results, it was inevitable there should have been much misdirected energy. in particular there has been, admittedly, much duplication of inquiries. each war organization, needing information of a kind not immediately avail able, has very naturally proceeded to obtain it at first hand by direct investigation and inquiry. because there is a large measure of overlapping in the statistical needs of the different war organizations there has been some overlapping of inquiries. business men and trade organizations have found themselves required to furnish information, essentially similar, but with just enough differences to require the work to be done over again, for two or more washington agencies. these wastes are now becoming smaller, as a result of increasing knowledge on the part of each war organization of the activities of others. a less excusable form of duplication has come from the neglect on the part of some of the new organization to inform themselves fully respecting the work of the established statistical bureaus, or, at any rate, from their failure to make use of the material that these permanent bureaus might easily have furnished them. as for the work of these permanent bureaus, out of my own experience in the work of one of the war organizations, i can vouch for their unfailing attitude of helpful and generous cooperation. certain of them, in fact, have taken on heavy additional burdens in this way. thus one may cite the more adequate and more promptly published statistics that are now available for the production of minerals and metals, and the prompter tabulation of foreign trade statistics. these are merely examples, for there is hardly a statistical bureau in washington that has not been called upon for some new or increased service. it must nevertheless be said that some of these bureaus have not risen to the full recognition of their opportunities. with so much that needs to be done, and so much that is being badly done by others by reason of insufficient experience or inadequate equipment, some of our permanent bureaus are giving virtually all of their energies to routine work, much of i which is of relatively little present importance, or are merely marking time. what i have just said should not be taken as imputing any blame to the men who are immediately responsible for the policies of these bureaus. most of them are handicapped by inadequate appropriations and find it difficult for that reason to arrange for any considerable increase in their functions. and in many instances the available appropriations are for specific purposes and cannot be transferred to new under takings. not only has it been easier to obtain funds for the new war offices than for the established organizations, but the new offices have been encumbered by fewer restrictions respecting the precise way in which they should use their funds. in this way they have virtually been compelled to do for themselves what might, in many cases, have been more economically and efficiently done by one or another of the permanent statistical bureaus. in statistical work, as in other fields of government activity, the new war organizations have been superadded to the preexisting administrative machinery rather than merged with it, a policy which has its disadvantages as well as its advantages. returning now to the topic of the work which has been done and which remains to be done by the different war statistical bureaus, it is to be observed that despite the differences in their tasks, a common thread of interest runs through their work. they are all concerned, fundamentally, with the general tasks which i have mentioned earlier in this discussion: the measurement of our national resources, whether in men, money, or goods; the determination of our actual and potential output of the immense variety of things that are important, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the war; the gauging, so far as may be, of our own needs and those of our allies and of the other countries that have to be recognized as in some measure dependent upon us. the problems of raising and equipping a fighting force, of providing ships and munitions, of food and fuel control, of the regulation of exports and imports, of the organization, of transportation, of industrial priority, of the adjustment of labor difficulties, of national economizing, and of war finance, are all inextricably interwoven. back of all these special problems is the general problem of the relative urgency of different national needs, the problem of priority in the widest sense. here not only successful administration but even the right choice of policies depends upon full and accurate knowledge, and in particular upon statistical knowledge. it is partly, perhaps, because this statistical problem is usually discussed in terms of its parts, rather than as a whole, that its enormous importance has not been fully realized. when compared with our aggregate annual expenditures for war purposes, our expenditures for statistical purposes are seen to be almost pitifully inadequate. it is easy to see the wastes and the duplications in such statistical work as has been done. it is harder, perhaps, to realize the indispensable character of most of this work. it is even harder to visualize the real advantages and economies that would result from the organization of statistical inquiries on a vastly greater scale than now obtains. many of the mistakes that have been made and some of them have undoubtedly been very costly have been due to the lack of full and exact statistical information. our expenditures for statistical purposes are not a thousandth part of our aggregate war expenditures. it might easily be wise economy to increase them ten or twenty fold. this much at least is certain: in range, in completeness within the fields which they cover, and in accuracy, the statistics now available furnish a wholly inadequate basis for the most efficient conduct of the task in hand. our statistical apparatus has not expanded in any such degree as the field of public interest has grown. confronted 8s we are by the necessity of making the most effective disposition of our national energies, we have not at tempted to secure anything like a complete and accurate statement of the forces at our disposal. in some special fields our knowledge may be fairly complete, but in other fields it is either incomplete or non existent. most of all we lack the materials for a picture of the whole economic situation, in valuable as it would be as an aid in the shaping of national policies. to make the point clear, imagine, if you will, what might have been accomplished if, when we entered the war, or even when our participation in the war came to be a serious possibility, there had been created a central statistical commission, instructed to develop a scheme for a comprehensive war statistical service. in the light of the experience of the other belligerent force there are few elements of novelty in our own war problems the greater part of our statistical needs might have been foreseen. plans for the utilization and extension of the work of existing statistical bureaus, as well as for the creation of new ones for special purposes, would very likely have been made. to begin with, there would have been a complete census of population, with inquiries respecting sex, age, marital condition, citizenship, nationality, occupation, and income. the schedule would have been simple and the tabulations would have been merely those which threw direct light upon the problems in hand. among other things this would have afforded a definite basis for a genuinely selective draft and for the right construction of a war income tax. then there should have been a general census of production, covering extractive as well as manufacturing industries, especially for the whole field of staple products, neglecting some of the customary inquiries, but putting special stress on such points as stocks and consumption of raw materials, stocks and output of finished products, capacity, existing contracts foreign and domestic and number of employees. similar inquiries might advisably have been made in the field of market distribution, at least so far aa the wholesale, jobbing, brokerage, commission, and storage trades are concerned. in the second place, provision should have been made for keeping much of this information up to date, through some system of weekly or monthly reporting, thus doing for important fields of industry and trade what is already done for agriculture and mining. the population census, even, might well have been used aa a starting point for continuous local population registers, under the charge of the police or of local registration officials. in all of this work it would be sufficient if the general tabulations showed classes )only, but information respecting individuals and firms ought to be available, by means of proper formalities, to the appropriate branches of the war administration. this may seem to be an ambitious statistical program, but, in view of the unprecedented magnitude of the interests involved, it is perhaps unduly modest. certainly it' would have to be supplemented, in any adequate scheme, by provisions for a more elaborate centralization of statistics of railway operations and of the general movement of goods, for very much more detailed statistics of foreign trade than we now have, for more comprehensive official records of wages and prices, and for the compilation of all available statistics bearing upon economic conditions in other countries. i have left out of account the enormous mass of information that has to be gathered with reference to individual persons and firms and transactions, rather than to groups or aggregates, aa primarily non statistical in character. i have also omitted reference to the use of statistics in purely military operations, as a subject apart. it may be worth noting, however, that napoleon put as much emphasis upon the value of complete statistics as a basis for military strategy as he did upon their use in the administration of civil affairs. under such a scheme of organization as i have in mind the central statistical commission would have other functions than that of planning and apportioning the work to be done. it would remain as a centralizing and coordinating body, a clearing house for the national war statistical service. as new statistical demands arose they would be referred by it to the bureaus best qualified to secure the desired information. it would confer with the organizations asking for statistical service and with the bureaus furnishing this service respecting such practical matters as the best construction of schedules and the best tabulation of returns. upon it would devolve the duty of making synthetic statistical studies of the whole national situation, the importance of which i shall try to indicate later. i hope that i shall not be interpreted as meaning that no separate war statistical organizations should have been created, that all of the work should be done by established bureaus under the general direction of the suggested central commission. this would be manifestly undesirable and impossible. some war organizations need statistical divisions for compiling and tabulating the records of their own activities. some of them need special statistical inquiries or special statistical information that is of importance and interest only to themselves. in many instances, too, statistical material, wherever obtained, has to be combined and organized so as to meet the special needs of a particular organization. the purpose of the suggested central commission would be, not to displace, but to coordinate and especially to supplement such statistical work as would naturally and necessarily be done if no such commission existed. nor is the matter of economy through avoidance of duplication the most important factor. the inevitable duplication of work on the part of bureaus that are concerned primarily with their own particular problems is a matter of relatively small moment compared to the fact that no number, no matter how large, of isolated bureaus will adequately cover the whole field of necessary statistical information, so far as that field is one in which their interests are common. each separate organization may cover the field in which its own interests are special, but this is no guarantee that it will be able to find anywhere or to provide for itself such fundamental statistics as are of common interest to itself and to other organizations. the difficulties under which war statistical work has been carried on in washington have come very largely from the absence of any organization with power to formulate the statistical problem &s a whole. but apart from the particular advantages which the existence of this fundamental general statistical information would give to the separate branches of the war administration, there is the yet larger gain that would come from a comprehensive view of our national assets, and more especially of our annual national product. this kind of view is essential to the wisest national strategy, to the most effective use of our available powers. only in this way can we find the materials for an estimate of our possible national savings not in terms of money, but of labor and resources and goods. only in this can we gauge the maximum amount that the government may wisely spend for war purposes as indicated by the part of the national product and of the national productive forces that it can divert to its own uses. such a statistical survey would indicate not only the foods, but also the raw materials, finished products, and classes of productive agents of which the supply is short as well as those of which there is a surplus. it would suggest, at least, where national waste exists. in short it would point the way, as i have already suggested, to the most effective marshalling and redistributing of all of our national energies. to summarize: our governmental statistical work has been largely concerned with such affairs as have happened to be matters of public or political concern. war not only enlarges the field of public interest, but it also creates a new set of values. these new values are not the outcome of the normal forces of supply and demand, but are, or should be, the expression of conscious decision respecting the relative worth of different things and different activities for the dominant national purposes. these values can be effectively recognized and expressed in action only on the basis of a far more comprehensive mass of statistical information than has been available or is likely soon to be available. a practicable if not the only method of planning for and obtaining these statistics on an adequate scale is through the agency of a central statistical commission. the cost, however great, would be small as compared merely with the magnitude of the economic problems dependent for a right solution upon the knowledge such statistics would give, and wholly negligible in view of the larger interests involved. what light does this review of the problem of statistical organization in war time throw upon the problem of statistical organization in time of peace? it is not to be presumed that after peace is to be concluded we shall continue to want precisely the sorts of statistics that are now needed, that the field of public interest will be wholly unchanged. nor is it to be presumed that we will be interested, as a nation, in just the things that were deemed most important before the war. the boundaries of the field of public interest will be narrower, undoubtedly, than they now are, but they will not be just what have been in the past. the lapse back from a thoroughly awakened national consciousness will not be complete. however large the measure of freedom restored to individual enterprise and to the individual conduct of life, we shall realize, as we have not in the past, the possibilities of doing things on a national scale, of rationally adapting the mechanism of national life to fit national ends. and there will be new national interests springing from our new participation in world affairs. there will be, in short, new fields of statistical inquiry. it is possible that there will not be a ready and general acceptance of a premise implicit in what i have said: namely, that the organization of national statistics should, in fact, correspond in scope to the field of public interest. is no weight to be given, it may be asked, to purely dispassionate and scientific interests? i confess to being somewhat skeptical with respect to the reality of a what is sometimes appropriately called idle scientific curiosity. there is an interest in technique and there is an interest in problems, and may it not be that our idle scientific curiosity is merely a name for an interest in technique strong enough to make the choice of problem a matter of indifference. but without venturing further on disputed and dangerous ground one may safely observe that the function of a national statistical service is primarily that of securing and purveying statistical information; that is, in a large sense, of answering questions and of providing the material for the solution of problems. as statisticians i fear that we have sometimes permitted our interest in technique to blind us to the social importance of the right choice of the problems to be covered in our federal statistical service. there is much satisfaction to be derived from doing our best with bad statistical material, from replacing the missing facts by careful inference and shrewd conjecture. one can even sympathize with the scholar who complained that the modern wealth of printed bibliographies had destroyed scholarship. but as a guide to the choice and administration of national policy, verifiable facts are infinitely better than estimate and conjecture. if statistics is not to be merely an occult science, statisticians must interest themselves in enlarging the scope of their sources of information and particularly in what we may describe as the national choice of statistical problems. although before the war our national statistical activities could be explained in terms of past and present phases of public interest, it cannot be said that all important phases of public interest were adequately represented. even then, i think we shall all admit, our national statistical service had not kept pace with the fast flowing current of economic and social change and with the accompanying development of new national interests. and with yet more profound changes impending in the near future, some form of method of statistical reorganization and adjustment will be urgently needed. this is because, in general terms, the formulation and administration of wise national policies must depend upon the national self knowledge that only statistical information, gathered on a much larger scale than we have been accustomed to think possible, can give. nor must the importance of an elastic and comprehensive scheme of statistical organization aa an element in preparedness for war be forgotten. a committee of this association, cooperating with commit tees of other associations, has been studying the problem of the organization of statistical work in washington. i am informed that it has given favorable consideration to proposals looking toward the creation of a central statistical commission. it is to be hoped that its efforts will help to secure tangible progress toward that end. but the functions of such a commission ought to include more than merely introducing some measure of coordination into the work of the existing washing ton offices. it should be empowered to make recommendations to congress for the inauguration of new statistical activities, utilizing either established offices or new ones, according to the circumstances of the particular case. it should control some discretionary funds, to be used in special inquiries made by its own staff or, more frequently, by one or more of the established statistical bureaus. its fundamental interest should be less in the statistical work that is being done than in the work that is not being done. it should try to eliminate some of the statistical dead wood that now cumbers the reports of many of the washington bureaus. it should not refrain, even, from attempting to introduce an element of national prophecy as well as of national history into our statistics. if the statistical problems brought sharply into the fore ground by the war hold any lesson that has a significance for times of peace, it is that we have not yet begun to realize the possibilities of federal statistics as a general scheme of national accountancy, or the responsibilities which the future holds for the statistician.

Mitchell","1908-1939","since the statistical association was founded in 1839 no year has brought such stirring changes in statistics as the year now closing. the war forced a rapid expansion in the scope of federal statistics and the creation of new statistical agencies. what is more significant, the war led to the use of statistics, not only as a record of what had happened, but also as a vital factor in planning what should be done. the war also brought an unprecedentedly large number of statisticians into government employ. probably there are few professional societies which have had so considerable a proportion of their membership engaged in war work as this association. tonight we feel a just pride in the service our fellow members have rendered. we cherish the hope that what they have helped to accomplish during the war toward the guidance of public policy by quantitative knowledge of social fact may not be lost in the period of reconstruction through which we are passing, and in the indefinite period of peace upon which we are about to enter. to forward that hope the association may seek a more active share in the work of federal statistics in the future than it has ever taken in the past. it is my pleasant task tonight to speak of these things our work in the year that has gone, our hopes for the years to come, and what we may do in the present toward achieving these hopes. a review of federal statistics in our memorial volume shows that before the war there were more than a score of statistical bureaus in washington publishing thousands of pages of figures each year. but there was no coordinating agency, no bureau whose duty it was to consider the statistical needs of the government as a whole and to formulate systematic plans for supplying these needs. hence, there was duplication of work, no one knows exactly how much; many important fields were imperfectly covered, or not covered at all; the results of different bureaus could not be compared or combined readily because of differences in units used, in periods covered, and in classification; finally, the cost of federal statistics was needlessly high. to remedy these defects of organization committees on federal statistics appointed by this association and the economic association had endeavored to secure the appointment of a central statistical commission; but they had met with little encouragement. as one member of these committees, i confess that our efforts had not been vigorously pushed. the war revealed the defects of the federal machinery for collecting statistics with startling suddenness; for war imposes a strain upon statistical offices quite as much as upon steel mills, or shipyards. as professor young said in his presidential address last year, war has come to be a conflict of directed masses, of aggregates. men, money, munitions, food, railways, shipping, raw materials, and manufactured products in great variety are impressed into the service of the nation. the problems of the effective control and use for war purposes of these varied national resources is intimately dependent upon a knowledge of their quantities, that is, upon statistics. just as this war is our largest national undertaking, so its statistical demands constitute, in the aggregate, the largest statistical problem with which we have had to deal. we were not prepared to cope with this problem. it is not to be expected, of course, that the statistical output of peaceful years will include all the data required for waging war. but it is to be expected that a governmental organization for gathering statistics will grasp a new statistical problem promptly and prepare plans for treating that problem with vigor. this test our federal bureaus failed to meet. the fault was emphatically a fault of organization rather than of individual officials. whatever charges of incapacity are made against the officials themselves properly should be made against the system under which federal statisticians are chosen and rewarded. for they are not chosen with an eye single to technical skill and administrative capacity; they are not paid salaries sufficient to attract and retain men of un common ability and ambition; the inadequate salaries are not compensated by public recognition of efficient service. we had, indeed, many federal statisticians better than our treatment deserved, men who served the country with zeal and intelligence. but, scattered through numerous small bureaus, prescribed a set routine of departmental duties, granted scanty appropriations, these men had little chance to consider the vast new problems of the war. they certainly did not, perhaps they could not, come forward with an efficient war program. for this shortcoming of our statistical organization we paid a heavy penalty. the time we spent in framing our war organization and getting it started might have been substantially shortened had anybody in washington been able to put before the responsible authorities promptly the data they needed concerning men and commodities, ships and factories. what did happen made an admirable exhibition of national energy and patriotism, but not a good exhibition of national intelligence. the war boards which the government set up to supplement the regular departments faced stupendous tasks. they were led and manned for the most part by men inexperienced in public administration, and unacquainted with the duties and resources of the federal departments. while these men were in the throes of laying their plans, and forming their staffs, they had also to find out that they needed statistics, what statistics they needed, and how to get them. although the federal government entered the war with twenty or more statistical agencies, the council of national defense, the food administration, the fuel administration, the shipping board, the war trade board, the railway administration, and the war industries board, sooner or later set up each a new and independent statistical agency to meet its special needs. the war department and the navy department followed suit. and these agencies, like the war boards which created them, had to be manned with people inexperienced in government work and unfamiliar with washington. although i was one of the raw recruits pressed into emergency work for the government, i cannot forbear speaking of the fine qualities which the new statistical staffs showed. each group studied the particular needs of the board which it served, and threw itself ardently into the task of collecting data. the new men worked with passionate intensity. they were appalled by no obstacles. where they could not get de finite data, they did not hesitate to estimate. the motto adopted by one of the leaders expressed the spirit of all: it cant be done? but here it is. yet the statistical work of the war boards as a whole showed precisely the same defect as the organization of the old statistical bureaus, and showed that fault in an aggravated degree. each new agency worked by itself for a separate board. hence there was much duplication of effort, and at the same time many important fields remained unworked; the results reached by different agencies could not be readily com pared or combined: and the cost was needlessly great. further, the energy of the new statistical agencies and the haste in which they worked magnified a minor fault of the old system to large proportions. these new agencies wanted to get their fundamental data from the original sources; so they sent out questionnaires to business men in a veritable flood. many manufacturing plants got elaborate papers which they were asked to fill out and return by the next mail in tens and in dozens. frequently, different questionnaires covered nearly the same ground, and usually they required not a little investigation within the plant to collect the data asked for. considerable expense and serious irritation was caused throughout the country by this obvious failure of organization in washington. this questionnaire evil brought back a flood of complaints, echoes of which reached the responsible heads of the war boards. the efficiency of economic mobilization seemed threatened; that was a more serious matter than the waste of public funds. the men who were most keenly aware of the lack of coordination in statistical work now had a strong talking point. steps were presently taken to remedy a fault which had been patent for a generation or more on a peace basis. the head of the division of planning and statistics of the shipping board was put in charge of the bureau of research of the war trade board, and then of the division of planning and statistics of the war industries board. thus three of the new statistical agencies were brought under a single direction. later the same man became chairman of the statistical committee of the department of labor, and finally he was authorized to form a central bureau of planning and statistics. the central bureau set up a clearing house of statistical activities, appointed contact men to keep touch with the statistical work of all the war boards and certain of the old departments, and began to supervise the issuing of questionnaires. when the armistice was signed we were in a fair way to develop for the first time a systematic organization of federal statistics. for the first few weeks after the fighting stopped, it seemed as if what had been gained in statistical organization might be lost almost at once. the rapid demobilization of the war boards threatened to sweep with it their statistical bureaus, or to scatter the new statistical bureaus among the old departments and leave us again in statistical confusion making figures in abundance but having no general statistical plan. but at a critical moment president wilson approved a plan by which the central bureau of planning and statistics was made the single statistical agency to serve the conferees at the peace table. thus, the central bureau was granted a reprieve for some months. it still remains to be seen whether this bureau or some successor serving the same centralizing functions will be made permanent. in speaking next of our hopes for the future, i am speaking merely as one member of the statistical association. yet i believe that most members of our association believe that the social sciences in general and social statistics in particular have a great service to render to government and through government to mankind. the episode in statistical organization which i have sketched, the effect of the war upon our attitude toward the use of facts for the guidance of policy, links the present stage of civilization with man's savage past. anthropologists have come to recognize that catastrophes have played a leading ro1e in advancing culture. the savage and the barbarian are such conservative creatures that nothing short of a catastrophe can shake them out of their settled habits, make them critical of old taboos, drive them to use their intelligence freely. in physical science and in industrial technique, it is true, we have emancipated ourselves largely from the savage dependence upon catastrophes for progress. for in these fields of activity, we have developed a habit of criticizing old formulations, of testing what our fathers accepted, of experimenting. we keep discarding the good for the better, even when not under pressure. the result is a fairly steady rate of advance, advance so regular that we count upon it in laying plans for the future. today we are sure that ten years hence our present scientific ideas and our present industrial machinery will be antiquated in good part. in science and in industry, we are radicals, radicals relying on a tested method. but in matters of social organization we retain a large part of the conservatism characteristic of the savage mind. a great catastrophe may force us for a little while to take the problems of social mobilization seriously. while under stress we make rapid progress. but when the stress is past we relapse gratefully into our comfortable faith in the thinking that has been done for us by our fathers. i know that there are ardent folk who will challenge these contentions at least for the present. they trust that the outburst of patriotic fervor brought by the war will carry us triumphantly forward for a generation. they count on the generous self sacrifice which all classes have shown, the fine discipline that our soldiers and war workers have maintained, to solve the problems of peace as they solved the problem of war. certainly we shall never be again precisely what we were before the war. but just as certainly we shall not remain what we have been during the war. we are all subject to emotional reactions, and, as john dewey has pointed out, the state of mind produced by the return of peace differs from that produced by the outbreak of war just as widely as peace itself differs from war. no, we cannot depend on any carry over of war psychology to organize democracy in peace. the social reformer we have always with us, it is true. or rather most of us are social reformers of some kind. and we all admire the qualities that go to make the leaders in social reform warm sympathy for the oppressed, courage to face ridicule, flaming zeal in the face of indifference, tact and energy in conducting crusades. but an indefinite succession of campaigns to secure this, that and the other specific reform is what we have been having for a long, long time. many of the re forms on which our grandfathers, our fathers, and our youthful selves have set their hearts have been achieved. yet the story of the past in matters of social organization is not a story that we should like to have continued for a thousand and one years. reform by agitation or class struggle is a jerky way of moving forward, uncomfortable and wasteful of energy. are we not intelligent enough to devise a steadier and a more certain method of progress? most certainly, we could not keep social organization what it is even if we wanted to. we are not emerging from the hazards of war into a safe world. on the contrary, the world is a very dangerous place for a society framed as ours is, and i for one am glad of it. the dangers are increased by our very progress in industry and in democracy. not long ago an english physicist reemphasized the fact that modern christendom is using up at an ever increasing pace the energy stored during long ages in the coal fields, and pictured the doubtful fate of human kind as hanging on the race between science and the atom. has not the time come to apply our intelligence to taking stock of the resources that the earth still holds and to developing methods of utilization that will protect our future? as for democratic progress, we know that men who can read and vote make restless citizens in a state where their work is not interesting to them and where their rewards do not satisfy their sense of justice. and such is the present state of affairs with millions of aggressive. they can be counted upon to change things by turmoil if things are not changed by method. taking us all together as one people in a group of mighty peoples our first and foremost concern is to develop some way of carrying on the infinitely complicated processes of modern industry and inter change day by day, despite all tedium and fatigue, and yet keeping ourselves interested in our work and contented with the division of the product. that is a task of supreme difficulty a task that calls for intelligent experimenting and detailed planning rather than for agitation or class struggle. what is lacking to achieve that end, indeed, is not so much good will as it is knowledge above all, knowledge of human behavior. our best hope for the future lies in the extension to social organization of the methods which we already employ in our most progressive fields of effort. in science and in industry, i have said, we do not wait for catastrophes to force new ways upon us. we do not rely upon the propelling power of great emotion. we rely, and with success, upon quantitative analysis to point the way; and we advance because we are constantly improving and applying such analysis. while i think that the development of social science offers more hope for solving our social problems than any other line of endeavor, i do not claim that these sciences in their present state are very serviceable. they are immature, speculative, filled with controversies. their most energetic exponents are still in the stage of developing new viewpoints, beginning over again on a different plan instead of carrying further the analysis of their predecessors. in part the social sciences represent not what is so much as what their writers think ought to be. in short, the social sciences are still childish. nor have we any certain assurance that they will ever grow into robust manhood, no matter what care we lavish upon them. there are blind leads of speculation in which past generations have mined industriously for ages with little gain. perhaps the social sciences will prove more like metaphysics than like mechanics, more like theology than like chemistry. the race may always shape its larger destinies by a confused struggle in which force and fraud, good intentions, fiery zeal, and rule of thumb are more potent factors than measurement and planning. those of us who are concerned with the social sciences, then, are engaged in an uncertain enterprise; perhaps we shall win no great treasures for mankind. but certainly it is our task to work out this lead with all the intelligence and the energy we possess until its richness or sterility be demonstrated. the social sciences, however, cover an immense field, and it is not probable that we shall encounter failure or success in all its parts. the parts where effort seems most promising just now are the parts in which this association is particularly interested. measurement is one of the outstanding characteristics of science at large, whether in the field of inorganic matter or life processes. social statistics, which is concerned with the measurement of social phenomena, has many of the progressive features of the physical sciences. it shows forthright progress in knowledge of fact, in technique of analysis, and in refinement of results. it is amenable to mathematical formulation. it is capable of forecasting group phenomena. it i$ objective. a statistician is usually either right or wrong, and his successors can demonstrate which. statisticians are not continually beginning their science all over again by developing new viewpoints. where one investigator stops, the next investigator begins with larger collections of data, with extensions into fresh fields, or with more powerful methods of analysis. in all these respects, the position and prospects of social statistics are more like the position and prospects of the natural sciences than like those of the social sciences. above all, social statistics even in its present state is directly applicable over a wide range in the management of practical affairs, particularly the affairs of government. and this practical value of statistics is readily demonstrable even to a busy executive. once secure a quantitative statement of the crucial elements in an officials problem, draw it up in concise form, illuminate the tables with a chart or two, bind the memorandum in an attractive cover tied with a neat bow knot, and it is the exceptional man who will reject your aid. thereafter your trouble will be not to get your statistics used, but to meet the continual calls for more figures, and to prevent your con vert from taking your estimates more literally than you take them yourself. we may well cherish high hopes for the immediate future of social statistics. in contributing toward a quantitative knowledge of social facts, in putting this knowledge at the disposal of responsible officials, we are contributing a crucially important part coward achieving the gravest task that confronts mankind today the task of developing a method by which we may make cumulative progress in social organization. what can the statistical association do toward realizing these hopes? of course, that is for the association to decide; but i venture to submit certain recommendations to the association's judgment. my plea is that the association seek to play a more active r61e in public affairs than it has played in the past. we are holding our eightieth annual meeting few learned societies in this country are so old. through all these years we have been mainly a learned society, cherishing our particular subject, criticizing those who neglect or misuse it, occasionally proffering advice, summing up experience, but not participating aggressively in the rough and tumble of statistical practice. all this kind of work has been serviceable. certainly conditions in washington and the state capitals have made participation by outsiders in official statistics exceedingly difficult. but conditions have changed somewhat and if we do our part with vigor they may change more. one is the active share that many members of the association have taken in war work. these men will not entirely lose their interest in federal statistics when they leave washington. for the next few years at least we shall have a corps of workers who know a good deal about conditions under which government figures are compiled and used. these men will help to make the association practical in any advice it may tender. be two changes seem to me especially promising. cause of them we have greater capacity to do serviceable work now than we ever had before, the association can be more helpful because it knows more and cares more about what the government bureaus do. the second change is in the attitude of washington officials toward the work of outsiders. just as those of us who have been in government service temporarily have gained a sympathetic insight into the difficulties faced by the permanent statistical bureaus, so the members of the permanent bureaus have become better acquainted with the viewpoint of outside statisticians. they have listened to our criticisms; in turn, they have criticized many of our suggestions for improving their organization and practices. as a result, they know how to utilize our services better than they did before the war. and they are, i think, not unwilling to annul the divorce between working statistician and academic critic and enter into a new relationship of mutual understanding and cooperation. one symptom of this new attitude is so gratifying that i cannot forbear calling especial attention to it. the secretary of commerce has asked the president of the economic association and the president of the statistical association to appoint each a committee of three to advise with the director of the census on matters of statistical principle and on the selection of statistical experts. this arrangement, it is hoped, will be no formal affair; but a working plan by which the producers and the consumers of statistics can cooperate effectively to improve the products in which both parties are interested. to provide the two committees with working facilities an office and a secretary have been furnished them by the director of the census. if we do our part toward making this arrangement a success, it may perhaps lead to the establishment of other bonds between the associations which represent the statistical public and the offices in which statistics are prepared. there are several practical measures toward which we may contribute if we like. for example, we may use our influence whenever opportunity arises to secure more adequate salaries for government statisticians. the scale of pay was too low before the war; the increased cost of living has made it shockingly inadequate. unless increases are granted many experienced men who would be glad to continue in public service will be compelled in justice to their families to look for openings elsewhere. now that the war is over, we cannot justly ask these men to stint their children for the rest of us. the profession of the statistician demands ability and training not less than those needed by accountancy; yet from what i can learn, the average remuneration of statisticians is decidedly lower than that of accountants. as representing the statistical profession, it is certainly the right of this association to urge vigorously a higher scale of salaries. we may also take a definite stand upon the continuation of the new statistical activities begun during the war. the war boards found it necessary to obtain monthly figures of stocks of certain commodities on hand, and monthly figures of the production of other commodities. these figures were collected in a variety of ways, by the census office, by trade organizations like the tanners council, or by sections of the war boards themselves. the results are of interest not only to the industries concerned, but also to the government and to the general public. the permanent maintenance of this service, perhaps in a modified form, is a measure that promises to command increasing support from business men. if systematically extended this work might well develop into a continuing census of production, simple in form, inexpensive; but of great value in forecasting business conditions and directing public policy. once more, there is the question which i mentioned in the first section of this address, whether the central bureau of planning and statistics is to be continued or disbanded when the peace conference has finished its work. some centralizing agency to consider the statistical needs of the government as a whole, and to lay systematic plans for meeting these needs is our greatest statistical lack. on a question of this character, is it not the duty of the statistical association to speak its mind? in any action we take we shall do well to distinguish clearly between two types of statistics the statistics that are used aa a record of what has been and the statistics that are used as a basis for planning what &all be. of these two types record statistics are the more familiar. they constitute the figures that go into annual reports, that are analyzed minutely by the student, that are quoted long after by the historian. such figures have an influence in shaping public policies; but that influence is vague and intermittent. the average administrative official cares little about what happened day before yesterday, his thoughts are obsessed by what is happening today and what should happen tomorrow. any one of us in his position would develop that frame of mind if he succeeded at all. what the administrator needs to guide public policy, what he will quickly learn to use if he gets them, is well organized planning statistics. planning statistics to be of service must be strictly up to date. they must show the vital factors in the situation. they must be presented concisely, in standardized form, both in charts and in tables. the data must be simple enough to be sent by telegraph and compiled overnight. rough approximations will serve the purpose. what we need practically at present is to develop statistical agencies for obtaining such planning statistics and putting them before the men whose decisions are important to the country, whether these men be administrators, legislators, or voters. as students our concern will continue to be chiefly with record statistics they must not be neglected, indeed they must be extended and improved. but men interested in affairs, our emphasis must be put upon the development and the use of planning statistics. the policy of active participation in shaping statistical work which i am urging seems to me justified by the circumstances of the day. during the war we learned that many things which seemed impossible were easy of accomplishment if at tacked with vigor. doubtless, the situation has already crystallized in part; but many matters of governmental policy are still in a fluid state. some changes will have to take place; the question is, what shall these changes be. if we put our practical knowledge and our practical experience at the disposal of the nation, we may increase our influence for years to come, and, what is vastly more important, we may help to make quantitative knowledge of facts a potent factor in government.

and if there is one hope that we as statisticians cherish more than any other, it is that we may obtain a good census. to forestall a possible misunderstanding, it may be well to say at the outset that the question which i am going to consider in this connection is not primarily what must be done in order to obtain such a census, but rather what are those features or characteristics which a census must possess before we can pronounce it good. to this question the most probable answer, i imagine, would be that a good census is one which is accurate and complete; and no one certainly will deny that accuracy is a primary essential. but it is not all that is needed to make a good census. it might be said that accuracy in a census is something like honesty in a confidential employee. no other qualities, however excellent, will compensate for the lack of it, but while essential it is hardly sufficient. regarding the importance of accuracy, there is in fact no room for differences of opinion. the only question in this connection that might be open to discussion, but one which i shall not stop to consider, is just how accurate a census must be to fulfill the requirements of a good census; for we all recognize that absolute accuracy in a census is neither possible nor, fortunately, necessary, a certain margin of error being permissible as well as inevitable even in the best of censuses. taking accuracy for granted, however, what are the other features of a good census? the taxpayer might suggest economy; and it is unquestionably of great importance that a census be economically conducted even though waste or extravagance may not impair the value of the finished product. one may well be disposed to view the increasing cost of the census with some dismay. the first census, that of 1790, was little more than a count of population a very rudimentary census, we should now consider it, which cost the modest sum of. the census of 1850, which may be regarded as the first comprehensive census, covering in detail population, agriculture, and manufactures, as well as some other subjects, cost. the estimated cost of the twelfth census, taken 50 years later was nine times that amount. the thirteenth census cost approximately. of course some part of this great increase in the cost of census taking was a natural and inevitable result of the growth of the country in population and resources. but that it was mainly due to the expansion of the census as regards the number of subjects covered and the greater elaborateness of the tabulation is evidenced by the fact that the per capita cost, as well as the aggregate cost, has greatly increased. the primitive census of 1790 could have been paid for by a contribution of one cent from every person enumerated. by 1850 the per capita cost had increased to 6 cents. it showed no appreciable advance in 1860, but reached 83 cents in 1870, 113 in 1880, and 18 in 1890. that was the maximum. but the reduction to 16 cents at the next census, that of 1900, is fully accounted for by the fact that the decennial census had been relieved of a number of statistical inquiries which previously had been attached to it, but were now either dropped altogether, as was the case with the mortgage investigation, or deferred until the main census was completed. so as a result of this readjustment certain inquiries which were formerly chargeable to the decennial census are now charged to the permanent or intercensal work of the census bureau. this readjustment having been effected, the cost of the census resumed its upward course, the per capita in 1910 being 17 cents, as compared with 16 in 1900; and beyond a doubt the census now being taken will cost much more than the census of 1910 for those reasons which make the costs of any enterprise or undertaking and also the costs of living so much greater at the present time than ten years ago. the great increase in the cost of the census is easily paralleled by the increase in the cost of other governmental functions or activities; and it may be of interest to inquire whether the expenditure for the census expressed as a fraction of the total disbursements of the federal government is any larger now than it was formerly. as the census is taken only once in ten years, the comparison may appropriately be based on the total governmental disbursements for the ten year period beginning with and including the census year. on this basis the census of 1850 represented a cost of about $248 per $100,000 paid out by the federal government during the ten fiscal years 1850 to 1859, inclusive. the corresponding figure for the census of 1880 was $222 per $100,000; that for the census of 1890 was $298; and that for the census of 1900, $229. before computing the ratio for 1910, we must take into consideration the fact that the government disbursements during the decade which began with that year and is now just completed include the enormous extraordinary expenditures for the war. for the purpose of a fair comparison i have, however, taken the disbursements for the first five years of the decade, or the years 1910 to 1914 inclusive, doubled this total, and accepted the result as indicating roughly what the expenditures of the government would have been under normal conditions. comparison of this figure with the cost of the 1910 census gives a ratio of $239 per $100,000. the figures here presented indicate that the cost of the census has at any rate not mounted more rapidly than the general expenses of the government; and i venture the prediction that the cost of the 1920 census, whatever it may be, will represent a diminishing fraction of the total governmental disbursements. before leaving this phase of my subject, i may give myself the satisfaction of pointing out that these computations mean that out of every $100 paid out by the national government in the course of ten years, about 25 cents is set apart and expended for the census. these figures are of interest in aiding one to view the cost of the census in its proper perspective. but, of course, they prove nothing regarding the question of whether the cost is justified. an expenditure of $20,000,000 (and the current census will cost more than that) is no trifling sum, no matter how small a fraction it m w be of the total expenses of the government, or how small a quotient may result when we use as a divisor the total population of the united states. i take it for granted, however, that the census of the united states is worth twenty millions provided we cannot get it for less. in other words, the census cannot be said to cost too much unless it can be shown that the cost is more than is necessary and that a census equally comprehensive might be taken for less money. to what limit the cost might mount before reaching the point where we should feel obliged to forego the census or reduce it to a mere count of population required by the constitution or otherwise materially curtail it, it would be idle to inquire. we may rest assured, i think, that the people in general, as well as the statisticians and economists, will insist on perpetuating the census. but that does not make it any less essential that the census should be economically and efficiently conducted; and economy is quite as important from the standpoint of the statistician or the user of statistics as from that of the taxpayer. for the less the census costs the easier it will be to extend and improve the statistical work of the federal government; the easier it will be to obtain, for instance, authorization and an appropriation for a quinquennial census of population and agriculture, or an annual census of production, or an adequate compilation of statistics of crime, not to mention other statistical inquiries not yet authorized but greatly needed. in general, the improvement and extension of statistical investigation are conditioned upon economy and efficiency in the organization and conduct of the work of gathering and compiling the basic statistical data. the introduction of electrical machinery has, as is well known, effected a very great economy in the tabulation of census data. this, however, has been manifested not in any reduction of expenditure, but in a greater output in proportion to expenditure. with the aid of the electrical tabulating machinery we are doing things today that we could not think of attempting if the tabulation had to be carried on by hand, as was the case 60 years ago. here, as in other fields, the introduction of labor saving machinery has not reduced employment, but has resulted in increased production. no corresponding advance or improvement has been made in the method or process of collecting the basic data, or in other words, the field work; and the field work in 1910 cost over $7,000,000, representing 45 percent of the total cost of the census. the compensation of enumerators alone aggregated which represents about 30 percent, or nearly one third, of the total cost. the method of taking the census or of obtaining and recording the basic data is essentially the same as it has been for the last fifty years or more. the enumerator or census taker makes a house to house canvass of his district, addresses the questions orally to the inhabitants, and enters the answers with pen and ink on a sheet schedule, having one line for each individual enumerated. it is doubtful whether any improvement over this process can be devised which will result in any material economy. the distribution of advance schedules or lists of questions to be filled out by the inhabitants before the enumerator calls, a procedure which was followed to some extent at the census of 1910, probably insures greater accuracy, but results in no appreciable saving of expense. the use of a punch card by the enumerator has been considered and tried out to a limited extent, but has not yet proved to be a success. the card punched in the field cannot be used for tabulation in the office. for the latter purpose a more perfect card of a smaller size is necessary and the punching must be done with greater precision than is possible in using a hand punch. there are other draw backs to the use of a punch card from the standpoint of economy, and it is also a question what the effect would be upon the accuracy of the returns. still it is possible that the punch card may be used by the enumerator at another census. economy, however, does not necessarily involve a reduction of expenses. it may be manifested in obtaining a better service at the same cost or even at an increased cost; and with regard to the field work of the united states census the most important problem is not, i believe, that of reducing expenses so much as that of improving the quality of the enumeration, in the direction of greater accuracy, completeness, and reliability. if we are to continue to take the census by the method now followed, the main problem is that of securing a good class of enumerators and placing them under efficient inspection and supervision. ode obvious way of obtaining better enumerators is to increase their compensation. the enumerator is employed for about two weeks in the cities and about one month in the rural districts. the average compensation of the enumerators in 1910 was about $70. it will be more than that this time, but the increase probably will not be so great as that which has taken place in the general scale of wages since the last census. to increase the enumerators pay, however, is seen to be an expensive method of improving the census when we reflect that an addition of $10.00 to the average pay of the enumerator means an increase of almost $1,000,000 in the total cost. is there any other effective appeal than that to the pocketbook? can we educate the public to regard the taking of the census as a public service, in which the individual is called upon to assist as a matter of public duty justifying and demanding some degree of sacrifice on his part? we remember in this connection the voluntary and uncompensated services which the citizens of this country cheerfully performed in connection with the draft. can we successfully appeal to the same motives of patriotism in calling for assistance in taking the census? probably not. the average , i think, is decidedly of the opinion that a government which is collecting more than h5,000,000,000 of revenue annually can afford and ought to pay for any peace time services which it may require from its citizens. if any material improvements in the field work of the census either in the direction of greater economy or greater accuracy are possible, they must come through better organization and greater efficiency rather than through reduced pay or volunteer services. so far as the present census is concerned, however, the question is purely academic; but it may be well worth thinking about in the course of the next ten years. taking accuracy for granted and having achieved economy, what are the other requisites of a good census? one, i should say, is expedition. a census is not a good census unless it is taken and completed promptly. but promptness, like accuracy, is relative or approximate. no census can ever be strictly up to date in the sense of representing exactly the conditions existing at the time the census is published. a certain period necessarily elapses between the date to which the census relates and the date of publication, and in that interval conditions change to some extent at least, so that if, as has been said, the census is a snapshot of the population and resources of the united states, we must recognize the fact that some little time is needed for the development of the plate. but the time spent in the dark room should not be unduly or unnecessarily prolonged, nor, i will add, unduly curtailed at the cost of marring the picture by underdevelopment. opinions may differ as to the period within which a census ought to be compiled and published, and the question when a census can be said to be completed is also open to discussion, as there are varying degrees of completeness. but with regard to the census of the united states, the former question has been authoritatively settled by legislation, the law prescribing the period of time within which the census reports shall he completed. it must be assumed that the period is a fair and reasonable one. therefore, one requisite of a good census in the united states is that it should be completed and published within the period of time prescribed by the law. the statutory limitation of the period within which the census must be completed was first introduced in the act providing for the twelfth census, or the census of 1900. the need of some such limitation was probably suggested and emphasized by the length of time it had taken to get out the reports of the previous censuses. most of the main reports of the census of 1880 were not issued until near the end of the year 1883, although the population volume and the two volume compendium appeared in the early months of that year. in the case of the census of 1890, there was even greater delay; none of the main reports was issued much before the close of the year 1894, while the second population volume, containing the occupation statistics, did not appear until 1897. in this matter of expedition the twelfth census, taken in 1900, made a good record; and yet the claim that it practically complied with the new requirement of the law limiting the period within which the reports must be issued is not fully justified. it is true that on july 1, 1902, the date of the termination of the census period, three of the ten main volumes had been published, and six more had been released for printing; these appeared within the next two months, and the remaining volume was published the following October. but the abstract was not issued until january; 1903, and the statistical atlas not until october of the year; the special occupation report, which was virtually as much a part of the twelfth census report as any of the numbered volumes, did not appear until june, 1904, practically two years after the termination of the period within which the reports of the twelfth census were by law to have been published. in fact, the permanent force of the census office was largely employed in finishing the twelfth census work for more than a year after the termination of the census period.* the thirteenth census, judged by any criterion except that of expedition, can, i think, be termed a good census, on the whole the best that was ever produced. but in the matter of expedition it was a sad failure. at the termination of the census period, not one of the main volumes had been issued, and of six series of state bulletins only three had been completed, the publication of the other three having hardly been begun. the first main volume to appear was issued in december, 1912, six months after the termination of the thirteenth census period as defined by law. the abstract appeared in february, 1913, and the other volumes at intervals throughout that year, with the exception of the general report on population, which went over into the next year, appearing on january 5, 1914, and the occupation volume, which was not issued until july, 1914. but to revert to the other question previously suggested, when can it be said that a census is completed? if not until all the basic data obtained have been duly tabulated and adequately exploited, then it can hardly be said that any census has ever been completed. indeed every census, at least since that of 1850, has contained questions which have never been tabulated at all. i am referring now to the main census subjects. i am not considering the various secondary investigations which were formerly tied up with the main census and which included numerous interrogatories that never bore any statistical fruit. the most striking recent instance of the neglect or failure to utilize all the available data obtained through the census is afforded by the question asking the number of children borne by each mother and the number still living at the date of the census, a question which appeared on the population schedule in 1890, 1900, and 1910, but remained unutilized with the single exception that some of the 1900 data covering a few small selected areas were tabulated by the immigration commission and published in its reports. the question of completeness, as i have said, is one of degree. it is not merely a question of making some use of every class of data on the schedules. it would be possible to tabulate the answers to every question and still have a census which would rightly be considered very deficient. we might, for instance, show ages for the total population only, without any distinction as to sex, color, or nativity; or show occupations without any age or sex distinctions. we might present a given classification for states only and not for cities, or for states and cities but not for counties. the question of completeness is thus a question of elaboration, of cross classification, or correlation, of detail. the possibilities of detail and of elaboration in tabulating the results of the census are almost infinite. but it must be assumed, i think, that when congress in the law providing for the twelfth census prescribed the period within which the census reports must be completed and published, it had in mind the established standard; or in other words, it had in mind reports having about the same scope and detail as those published in connection with the censuses of 1880 and 1890. the bureau of the census at any rate cannot undertake to do more than that within the census period; and it will do well if it does that. will the census office be debarred from making any further study or use of the fourteenth census data by this requirement of the law that the reports upon the inquiries shall be completed and published before july i, 1922? when that date arrives and the main census reports have happily been completed and published, must the schedules be relegated to the dust of storage to be referred to only when someone for a good and legitimate reason affecting, perhaps, property interests, wants to know whether john smith of smithville was a married man in 1920? it is one feature of a good census, surely, that the data obtained by it at such great expense should be fully utilized, exploited, and interpreted, or, in other words, that we get out of the census all that there is in it. otherwise we fail to realize on our investment. i obviously am assuming that the data on the original schedules are not adequately exploited when the main reports are issued. experience justifies that assumption. i have already called attention to the fact that at every census certain questions on the schedules have been entirely neglected; but quite aside from this, the need and opportunity for further tabulations have been made evident regarding questions or classes of data which were not entirely neglected, but were covered in a general way by the main reports. for instance, the preparation of the twelfth census report on occupations involved a further tabulation of census data after the main reports were completed. this is also true of the special reports on women at work and on child labor. the supplementary analysis does not belong in quite the same class because it was simply a study, analysis, and reclassification of statistics already published in the main reports, and did not involve the utilization of any unpublished data. the statistics used as the basis of this work were, therefore, available to any one who wished to make use of them. nevertheless, it is safe to say that no private individual, and probably no institution other than the census office, could have under taken the work involved in the preparation of that volume. it required the equipment of an organized statistical office supported by the resources of the federal treasury. another illustration of the fact that the census data are only partially exploited in the main reports is afforded by the plan which was considered at both the twelfth and the thirteenth census for a tabulation of data relating to the family. in the main census reports, the unit is the individual. no facts are shown regarding the family beyond the mere number of families, classified by size and by the tenure of their homes. in the projected report, all the significant census facts regarding the family, such as the occupation of the head of the family, the number of children the number at school and the number at work the presence or absence of boarders or lodgers, were to have been tabulated. at the twelfth census cards were actually punched for the family tabulation. it is by no means always necessary to go back to the original schedules to find new and interesting information not contained in the main reports of the census. frequently it is a question simply of another run of the punched cards through the tabulating machines. suppose, for instance, that it is desirable as i think it is that the facts regarding sex, age, marital condition, illiteracy, and ability to speak english should be shown not merely for the foreign born population as a whole, as is done in the main reports of the census, but for each foreign nationality separately, the germans, the irish, the italians, the swedes, etc. another run of the cards would furnish this information. it is fairly evident, then, that the data obtained by a decennial census cannot be fully exploited or adequately analyzed and presented within the period of a little over two years allowed by law for the completion of the reports. that, as director north truthfully said in his first report following the termination of the twelfth census period, is physically impossible. either the data must be abandoned or buried when only partially utilized, or we must continue the tabulation, study, and analysis of the census after the census period has terminated. i can, i think, take for granted that the audience i am addressing would advocate the second of these alternatives; and the census office since it became permanent has, in fact, as i have already pointed out, supplemented the main reports by special reports or studies prepared and published after the termination of the census period. but it has never done all that it has planned to do in this direction, has never, in my opinion, planned to do as much as should be done, and has felt compelled to apologize more or less for doing as much as it has done, the apology being intended to forestall criticism for issuing delayed reports and publishing figures alleged to be out of date. it is highly desirable that the further exploitation of the census data be continued after the termination of the census period as defined by law, and that the public should be brought to appreciate the importance of this work, as it would be, i think, if in accordance with the recommendations of the census advisory committee representing this association, a series of supplementary census studies, wisely planned and carefully prepared, were published soon after the completion of the current census.

Doten","1908-1939","not long ago i glanced through a book that i had read with very keen interest when it came from the press some twenty years ago. this was richmond mayo smiths statistics and economics. the thought occurred to me that it might be of interest to both economists and statisticians to review the progress that has been made in this field during the first two decades of the twentieth century. you will recall that mayo smith had great hopes concerning the service that statistics could perform for both sociology and economics. have these hopes been justified by subsequent developments? it is obvious that this is not the time or the place for one to present a thoroughgoing review or a detailed analysis of all of the work that has been done during the past twenty years in economic statistics. i shall therefore deal in a general way only with the changes that have occurred. the subject under consideration naturally divides itself into two parts: what is economics, and what is service? i shall not be foolhardy enough to attempt in the presence of so many experts to propound or defend a new definition of economics. generally speaking, economics is the science which explains or attempts to ex plain economic life or economic phenomena; but there is not so clear cut a distinction between the facts of economic life and the theories that are held with regard to them as there is in the natural sciences or even in some of the other sciences pertaining to man. for example, the motions of the stars have not been affected by astronomical theories. the properties of matter have not been changed by the developments in the science of physics, and chemical research has not altered the chemistry of nature. on the other hand, much of the economic life and structure of the world is the product of mans thought and conscious design. there have been attempts to trace the effects in economic life of special theories and of great leaders of economic thought, but too often the attention of the student has been given to the theories set forth in formal treatises. in other words, economics has been regarded as the writings of the economists. even at the present stage of the worlds history, when thousands of college students are voluntarily or otherwise engaged in the study of the texts which the economists write for each other to read and when even business men sometimes read literature of this sort, the extent to which formal economics finds its way to the popular mind is very limited indeed. yet in spite of all this every man who is not an idiot is an economist. that is, he has an economic philosophy of some kind which not only determines his votes on great economic issues such as the tariff, taxation, government ownership, ship subsidies, and social insurance, and his attitude toward labor unionism, cooperation, profits sharing, and so on, but which also guides him in his personal efforts and contacts in doing business. as the greater part of a mans time is devoted to getting a living, so the greater part of his thought is taken up with economic problems. the economics that prevails in the world today, in spite of the great increase in the tribe of professional economists in the one hundred and fifty years since adam smith, is still, as it always has been, the com mon garden kind which every man grows for himself, and not the highly developed hothouse exotic which we school men have been so carefully cultivating. naturally, the kind of economic theory which the individual develops for himself is largely the product of his environment, that is, his business and social contacts and associations. thus we have trade union economics, farmers economics, manufacturers economics, bankers economics, exporters economics, and so on. from the school mans point of view, each one of these species of economics is full of fallacies, and yet what have we been able to do about it? we ridicule the lump of labor theory and proclaim that higher wages depend upon increased productivity without visible effect upon labor union policies or theories. we point out the true advantages of international trade, but the old mercantilist conception of a favorable balance payable in money everywhere holds sway. we say that a tax on economic rent cannot be shifted, and yet the little band of single taxers who under the leadership of henry george embarked upon a crusade to popularize this doctrine is still a voice crying in the wilder ness after forty years of devoted endeavor. so we might go on and show in detail how the theories of the professional economists have failed to make a dent in the protective mental this is too narrow a view. the addendum to this article has been inserted at the end of this volume armor of the practical business men. it is true that the man on the street makes use of language that sounds like that of the economists and that he often proclaims his belief in the science by asserting that economic laws cannot be abrogated. when pressed to mention the laws he has in mind he usually falls back on supply and demand. thus we find that economics is of two kinds that of the small body of professional economists, and that of the great mass of the people and both kinds split up into several varieties. my second question was: what is meant by service? how can statistics serve economics? the best service that statistics can perform is to bridge the gap between the two kinds of economics that i have mentioned. statistics, on the one hand, can make some of the theories of the economists more intelligible to the man in the street, and, on the other hand, can be used to expose some of the fallacies in the theories of the man who cannot or will not study the textbooks. statistics provides a common language that both can use. statistics, to use a much overworked term, will sell economics to the business world. it is not my purpose to attempt to show that every phase of economic theory is susceptible of statistical demonstration, though it is a fact that mayo smith succeeded fairly well in giving a statistical content to every chapter in a formal treatise on economics. twenty years ago statistics, outside of governmental departments and some of ,the great insurance companies, occupied a limited field, and there were only two or three books in the english language dealing with its technique in a comprehensive manner. the membership of the statistical association numbered less than three hundred after over sixty years of active existence, and not more than half of the members were engaged in any kind of statistical work. today the membership is four times as large, and nearly all of those who have come in recently are active statisticians. thirteen years ago the policy of holding joint sessions with the economic and other associations was inaugurated. i have noted, as no doubt you have, that the programs of the economic association have in the intervening years grown more and more statistical. in fact, at the meeting at atlantic city last year it was difficult at times to determine by listening to the papers and the discussion whether one was in a session of that association or of the american statistical association. this same tendency may be noted, though to a somewhat less marked degree, in the economic review. on the other hand, among the statisticians there have been marked changes going on. a rapidly increasing number of persons are engaged in business research. now business research means essentially economic statistics. for several years most of the quarterly meetings and a considerable part of the program at each annual meeting of the american statistical association have been devoted to this kind of statistical work. may i digress for a moment to point out the significance of the fact that this new field of endeavor is called business research and not economic statistics? this choice of terms was not due to a mere whim or fad, but is based upon a real conviction that both economics and statistics were handicaps in dealing with business men. here is food for thought for both the economists and the statisticians, though the latter may find some little comfort in the fact that the term business supplanted economics long before statistics was abandoned in favor of research. it would be interesting to inquire into the causes of the low esteem in which economics and statistics were held until quite recently by business men, but it would take us too far afield. it is more important to consider present tendencies and to note that business men are gradually coming to have a greater appreciation of the services of economists and statisticians. this change has come about to a considerable extent in the last ten years, and it has been especially marked during and since the war. among the numerous causes for this change of attitude may be mentioned the facts that the business men of the present generation are more largely college men, that business is on a larger scale, and especially that the practical aspects of economics have been given greater emphasis in college curricula and in the writings of economists in recent years. in some institutions departments of economics have been practically transformed into schools of business, and in other institutions separate schools have been established; but everywhere banking, transportation, industrial relations, industrial organization and management, and other courses of this sort have been developed to a greater extent than those concerned with pure theory. coincident with these changes in the teaching of economics have been striking developments in the business world. scientific management, production engineering, cost accounting, employment management and personnel work have opened up new fields of investigation, new professions, and a new literature, all of which are economic in their nature. they also make large use of statistics. but large scale business needs not only the services of these specialized economists and statisticians in its internal organization and management, but it needs also large and extended markets. this affords an opportunity for another set of practical economists and statisticians to develop the possibilities of advertising and salesmanship. to meet the needs of business for statistical, economic, and industrial information a considerable number of service organizations and publications have come into existence. whether these agencies are purely commercial or really scientific, in the best sense of that term, their growth and successful operation imply the existence of a pressing demand for the information which they can supply. in practically every industry operators as well as operatives have some organization. many of these organizations are nation wide in their extent, like the iron and steel institute, the national cotton manufacturers association, and the association of general contractors. then there are still more inclusive organizations, such as the national manufacturers association. and so the list might be extended to include mining, farming, stock raising, commerce, and trade, all of which have participated in the great organization movement that has swept over the country in the last twenty years. another somewhat older type of organization among business men, the chamber of commerce or board of trade, has shown remarkable vitality and wonderful growth in recent years, especially since the chamber of commerce of the united states was formed. thus every city and, one might almost say, every village has its chamber or board, so that the whole country is covered by local, state, and national associations. nearly all of these organizations and associations have developed research bureaus or statistical departments of one sort or another. the same is true of the great banks, transportation companies, and other large commercial and industrial corporations. in carrying on the work of these bureaus and departments, economists have become closely associated with business men, to their mutual benefit. this has come about through volunteer work on committees and advisory boards, as well as through the employment in these enterprises of young economists taken from college faculties and of statisticians from government service and other fields of statistical work. but more important than all of these undertakings in the line of associated effort was the great war. in washington and in all the industrial centers business men and economists worked side by side. some were in uniform and some were dollar a year men. some were in the greatly expanded personnel of the war and navy departments, but more were in newly created agencies like the war trade board, the council of national defense, the war industries board, the fuel, the food, and the railroad administrations, the shipping this is distinctively an age of associated effort. board, and the war labor board. in all of these activities the technical training of the economist and statistician supplemented the practical knowledge of the business executive, and each came to know and esteem the other. acquaintanceships and attachments were formed which will tend to increase cooperation and mutual understanding in the years to come. economists and statisticians may well feel a degree of satisfaction at the progress indicated in this very imperfect sketch. but let us not deceive ourselves. the battle is not yet won, and this is no time for complacency and inactivity. under the stress of hard times business men are inclined to curtail expenses, and these new activities are naturally the first to be cut down or abandoned. the federal government has been the great agency that has gathered most of the fundamental data used by economists and statisticians in the economic field. government service has been also a splendid training school. bur, low salaries and the high cost of living in washington have driven many out of government work, and the conditions are such that academic men cannot afford to make the sacrifices involved in accepting even temporary employment in the various bureaus. it is probable that this situation cannot be changed while the demand for retrenchment and lower taxes is so insistent, but with the hoped for lessening of the burden of armaments there will come the opportunity to press for larger appropriations in other lines. when this time comes congress must be educated, as the business world has been, to see the importance of economic research. in concluding, i cannot deny myself the privilege of making something like an appeal to the members of these two associations. i feel very keenly the necessity for continued and possibly aggressive activity. the two associations, through a joint committee appointed at the re quest of the secretary of commerce, have been cooperating for almost three years with the director of the census in the great task of the fourteenth decennial census. this same committee has been made use of also by secretary hoover in certain other matters, especially in connection with the recent unemployment conference. the success of this arrangement has been such that i am convinced that it should be regarded as only the beginning of a much more extensive co6peration with governmental agencies. we cannot accomplish much by passing resolutions at our annual meetings. we must have committees charged with the duty of following up all matters that we are interested in at washington. these committees should be given the right to speak for the associations unsatisfactory conditions exist in another quarter also. whenever they deem it necessary. in other words, we have as much right as the anti saloon league, the labor unions, and the multitude of commercial organizations to seek to guide legislation and to promote more efficient administration. but in the final analysis the obligation rests upon each of us individually to do his part. we must interest ourselves in what goes on in washington. if we are to have the kind of information that we want, we must keep calling for it. bureau and department officials need strong support in dealing with congress. get in touch with them personally or by correspondence. praise them for their good work. criticize their errors, if need be, but dont forget or neglect them. let them know where to look for advice and help when they need it, and when they call for assistance try to respond promptly even if it means some personal sacrifice.

Rossiter","1908-1939","since the organization of the statistical association nearly a century ago, problems affecting the modern state, society, and industry have multiplied in number and gravity. most of them have arisen directly or indirectly from the extraordinary increase in the population of civilized nations during this period. hence, in some degree to measure these problems, the collection of statistics in increasing detail and with increasing accuracy has become indispensable in our time. statistics is a scientific method. it is the characteristically modern way of collecting and marshalling facts. these facts in turn become the raw material of the economist, but from the standpoint of this association i rejoice that modern economics is tending to become more and more inductive and statistical. in each field, however, there remains much independent work to be done, and the statistician may find at hand, wherever he turns, material from which it is possible to construct reliable statistical tabulations, often of surprising interest and importance. i shall ask you this evening to follow a brief account of the phenomenal increase of population of european blood which occurred in one century, inquiring especially whether any resemblances exist between population changes in europe and those in the united states; if so, to what extent, and to what these increases appear to lead. it is not probable that the immense increase during the century which elapsed from 1810 15 to 1910 20 in the number of human beings of european blood residing in europe and elsewhere had a counterpart on any considerable scale at any other period of human history. this sudden and phenomenal growth is a fact of profound importance. it is the result of far reaching influences, all of which are not yet fully spent or understood. already it is a population adventure. economics is a definite and important science. the future to further adventure, limitless in its possibilities for the human race. this century of great human increase was bounded at its beginning and its ending by the greatest wars known. in 1815, just as the napoleonic wars ended, the population of europe, including the number or equivalent of persons of european blood in the americas and elsewhere throughout the world, probably did not much exceed persons. a century later, as europe wen entering upon a great war exceeding in misery and costliness all earlier conflicts, the population of europe, and again including persons of' european origin in the americas and elsewhere, approximated. it is necessary at the outset to emphasize the radical difference in the rates of increase of population before the nineteenth century as compared with those of our own time. confining ourselves to europe, it is hard to realize in this swiftly moving age how small a change in the number of inhabitants probably occurred in a hundred year period. these early centuries in europe, let us say from the year 1000 to 1700, were hand power centuries. human beings were comparatively few in number; they tilled the soil, utilized beasts of burden and to a limited degree, wind power, and engaged in public and private warfare as their principal occupation. change from century to century was thus very gradual. one estimate places the growth of european population from 1570 to 1670 at one third. if we waive the important matter of variation in percentage of increase and accept as constant from the year 1000 the liberal one third estimated for the seventeenth century, then a population in round numbers of 19,000,000 for all europe would have been required at the earlier date to furnish. the 194 millions, the known approximate population, in 1815. in that event, the increase in 800 years would have been less than one half of the increase in the number of persons of european blood which took place during the single century 1815 to 1920. it is possible, however, that in the year 1000 the number of in habitants in all europe was greater than 19,000,000, and that the increase for several centuries at least was less than one third, but that the proportion tended to increase up to the one third suggested as existing from 1570 to 1670. this was an increase of approximately one third percentury for part of the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and part of the sixteenth centuries. in 1782 the population was an increase at the rate of about 50 percent percentury for part of the sixteenth, the seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth centuries. in 1880 the population of geneva city was 76.197, an increase during the nineteenth century period at the rate of about 200 percent. a little later, in 1701, a fairly well established approximation exists for england and wales, by which the population was set for that year at 6,121,525. this figure, compared with 8,892,536 the known population in 1801 suggests with somewhat increased signs of accuracy an eighteenth century increase of 45 percent. sets the population of europe in 1747 at. from this figure we find that the 63 year increase (1810) was about 30 percent. with such slender basis of fact, i venture to suggest for your approval, or at least for your consideration, the likelihood that (1) the population of europe in the year 1000 must have been between eighteen and thirty millions; (2) population increase was extremely slow, but tended century by century to gather headway; and (3) an increase of possibly 33 percent per one hundred years was reached by the seventeenth century, and of 50 percent by the eighteenth century. in this unsatisfactory way only are we able to establish a background for the figures, meager enough to be sure, available for 1815, and in particular to contrast early growth in what we may call the hand power period prior to 1815 with the astonishing growth and its attending phenomena that have characterized our own period. you are familiar with the beginnings of census taking in Europe. the first enumerations made at the opening of the nineteenth century in france and britain, inspired to some degree, it is pleasant to believe, by the proof which our own first census a decade earlier must have afforded that a nation wide enumeration was practicable; and you recall the. fact that estimates of population in other western nations were becoming more and more frequent and reliable. estimated that in 1810 15 the total population of europe, including european russia, was about. including the balkan states, the total population in 1810 15 appears to have been approximately 194,500,000. half a century later, 1860, this total had increased to 293,000,000, and after another half century, 1910 15, it had reached 454,000,000. here was an increase of 51 percent during the first half and 55 percent during the second half of the century, in absolute figures, 98i millions and 161 millions respectively. in 1815 the condition of the nations of europe seems to have resembled rather strikingly that of their descendants a century later. of the fifteen nations here specified, nine had then just emerged from the welter of conflict more or less continuous for a decade or more. almost all of them were prostrate and deeply in debt. in fact, the actual indebtedness of the six leading nations, including that part of france's obligations later repudiated, a total easily equivalent to two or three times that amount in our own time. it is significant that some of this great amount, especially that portion of the british debt represented by permanent government securities, is actually in effect unpaid today. yet, in 1815, with many new boundaries, huge indebtedness, comparatively limited population, and seemingly a discouraging outlook for economic recovery, europe nevertheless was actually on the verge of an immense industrial awakening, with corresponding stimulus to human increase. the influence of this awakening was everywhere felt. it was most marked, however, in those countries which took the lead as distinctly industrial states. of the approximate hundred million increase in the population of europe up to 1860,41 millions were contributed by great britain and the two germanic empires, 29 millions by russia, and the remaining 284 millions by some twelve other nations, including the present balkan states. population all over europe tended to increase even more liberally as this distinctly industrial and commercial century advanced. the passage of the second half emphasized the growth, first, of those states which had taken the lead in manufacturing and commerce, such as great britain, germany and austria, and second, of a number of nations previously having rather sluggish population increase, such as italy, holland, spain, and several of the smaller countries. in absolute increase nearly all the countries of europe showed stimulated increase from 1860 to 1910 15 as compared with corresponding figures for here, however, we are inclined to ask whether the noteworthy growth of european nations during the past century affected urban and rural areas to the same extent, or whether the extreme industrial development of the period decreed greater urban increase. it is difficult to ascertain the population of many large cities in europe in 1810 15 out side of great britain and france. it can be determined' that a group of twenty five including most of the great cities, had a population of approximately three and a quarter millions (3,215,000), about 1800 15. in 1910 15 the corresponding total was twenty two and a quarter millions (22,276,000). this was an increase of nearly 600 percent. the conclusion seems reasonable that if the population of twenty five large cities expanded about sevenfold in a century, the population of the other principal cities of europe increased at about the same rate. in 1910 15, in great britain and upon the continent of europe, there were 369 cities each having not less than 50,000 inhabitants? the aggregate population of all these cities was seventy four and one fourth millions (74,315,684). if the increase for the century in this entire group had corresponded to the increase already noted for 25 of the number, then these 369 cities had an approximate population in 1810 15 of but 10,750,000 and they together represented less than 6 percent of the total population at that period as compared with nearly 17 percent in 1910 15. but if the population of europe, exclusive of the large cities, increased during the century here considered a little more than 125 percent, and if the large cities by themselves increased nearly 600 percent, clearly showing the control and stimulation of industrial and commercial activities, what of the united states? are we in this country revealing population changes at all resembling those of europe, or are we following independent lines of growth? turning backward a century from our last census, in 1820 the population of the united states was slightly over nine and a half millions (9,640,000). during the next fifty years (to 1870) there was an increase of approximately 300 percent. during the next half century, from 1870 to 1920, the population of the united states increased approximately 165 percent. the population of europe, on the other hand, increased 51 percent from 1810 15 to 1860 65. half a century later, at the end of the period we are considering, the increase was 55 percent. here is a surprising dissimilarity in the two half century increases in the united states, caused by slowing down of increase, and a surprising resemblance between the two half century increases in europe. thus far in our analysis there appears to be no resemblance between the increases shown by the old world and the new. in 1810 15 the population of europe was native of native parentage and race. in 1860 and again in 1910 15 the population was native, and thus strictly comparable. in 1820 the white population enumerated in the united states was almost exclusively descended from the colonial settlers. so true was this that the element foreign born and of foreign parentage in 1820 was estimated in 1850 to have been no more than 360,000. the negroes were of more recent arrival, but most of them were born of born parents. half a century later, 1870, the total population was nearly forty millions (39,818,44g2). what part of that total (1870) was here a new consideration presents itself. comparable with the population of the united states in 1820? on the other hand, what part of the population in 1870 was not only foreign born but of recent european parentage, and thus justly entitled to be classed at that period as europe’s product rather than the product of america? it has been my privilege during the past year to prepare a publication for the federal census bureau which contains a study of native and contributed stock.’ it enables us to approximate the number of per sons of european birth or origin arriving after 1820 who were enumerated in 1870. this number was approximately 10,250,000, of whom possibly 8,000,000 ought to be credited to europe in 1860 65, in order to appraise accurately europe’s increase. upon making this credit, the percentage of european population increase from 1810 15 to 1860 65 advances from 51 to 55, and the corresponding increase in the population of the united states (1820 70) shrinks to 230 percent. these percentages, though much closer than the gross figures first quoted, still bear no resemblance at that period, and none, indeed, should be expected. it is with the second or last half century that we are principally concerned. in 1920 the white and colored population of original stock in the united states (corresponding to that just established for 1870) was approximately fifty eight and a quarter millions (58,219,000) ; and the element of our population belonging to europe’s increase had grown to forty seven and a half millions (47,491,000). crediting this element to europe as a just part of europe’s increase for the half century preceding 1910 15 results in a european increase of 71 percent for the second half century, as compared with 101.6, to which figure by this adjustment the increase for the united states 18’70 to 1920 now shrinks. during this half century, however, europe’s contribution was liberal to south america and to other distant lands. doubtless these contributions also should be included in europe’s human product during the period considered. by making this added credit, the percentage of european increase rises to about 76, as compared with the distinctly increase previously stated as 101.6. thus it appears probable that if european increase were merely to remain stationary, the marked slowing down of increase long in evidence i:n the united states would mean a constantly closer approach to the same rate of increase for both continents. turning to a comparison of the rate of increase of the urban population of europe with that of urban increase in america, we are again confronted by the fact that the increase shown by the cities of europe, 1 increase of population in the united statea, like that of the entire continent, was contributed almost exclusively by the natives of the lands in which the cities themselves are located. in london, for example, the foreign born element in the population is only about 3 percent. on the other hand, much of the extraordinary growth of cities was secured by appropriating a good share of europe's increase. the total population in 1920 of 122 cities of the 144 having 50,000 or more inhabitants was thirty one million (30,910,552), and the corresponding total for 1870 was six and three quarters millions (6,850,693). this was an increase from all sources of more than 300 percent. what was the percent of increase of european cities during the corresponding half century? since they were unaided by extensive foreign immigration, the rate of their total in crease must have been much lower than that recorded by cities. of the 369 cities previously referred to as having 50,000 or more inhabitants in 1920, the population in 1860 65 can be ascertained with out undue search for 169. this, however, proves to be a representative group, since practically all the countries of europe are included.' these 169 cities increased from nearly twenty two millions (21,880,343) to fifty four millions (54,451,513), or 149 percent. this is approximately half the rate of natural increase reported by cities when reinforced by a continuous stream of immigration. obviously no real comparison can be made with that sort of increase. what was the normal growth of cities in the united states during the half century from 1870 1920, when divested of european aid, since such aid must be regarded as merely a temporary and an artificial means of increase? in 1870 the number of native whites was recorded by the census. this class is reasonably comparable with the class, native whites of native parents, returned by the census half a century later. had this proportion amounted to 20 percent, the increase from 1860 65 to 1910 15 of the 169 cities here considered, resulting from crediting these persons to the group, rises to about 155.1. it thus appears that the rates of increase of urban population in the united states and europe, when sources of increase are made reasonably comparable, prove to be nearly the same. this similarity suggests that industry and commerce influence rates of population increase to about the same degree upon both sides of the atlantic. if the two great sections of european blood the inhabitants of europe and America are combined, the percentage of increase proves astonishingly uniform. the aggregate population of europe and the united states increased during the first half of the last century, 1810 20 to 1860 70, 63 percent, and during the second half, 68 percent. population changes in europe and america are, after all, much alike. the percentages of increase shown by each are tending to become substantially the same, as merely relating to parts of one great race the contribution, on the one hand, of separated sections or national entities, on the other, of a great conglomerate drawn from these separate nations and fused in america. if the increase during the coming century in the population of europe, north america, and the estimated number of persons of european blood elsewhere were to be placed at the one third percentury rate already suggested as likely to have prevailed for the period prior to 1800, the number of persons of european blood in 2020 would be 860 millions; but if the rate of increase shown for the past century by europe and the united states combined were to be maintained to 2020, the number of persons of european blood living in that year would reach the amazing total of 1,980,000,000. inspection of these possible totals creates the impression that shrinkage of increase back again to an absolute of not over one third for a century is more likely to occur than continuation of the exceptional rate of increase shown from 1810 15 to 1910 15, which would lead to a total number of persons of european antecedents greater than all the present inhabitants of the globe combined. the former would represent a population capable of living with no very radical modification of our present conditions of existence; the latter would represent an adventure in population growth almost beyond comprehension, and also would mean changes in a11 the activities of life probably much more radical than those which have occurred since 1815, resulting in an al most inevitable lowering in the scale of living. consideration of the general figure of growth in number of' persons of european blood seems, if this be accepted, what of the future? therefore, to tend toward this conclusion: increase during a century extremely prolific in humanity appears to be slowing down in europe and america and to lean again toward earlier rates of growth. any upward variation shown is likely to come from continents and islands still awaiting development. here, clearly, we reach the confines of the statistician’s domain. the adventure of future population increase belongs to the food specialist, the sociologist, biologist, and economist. we have already noted that so vast is the population of european blood today that in the short space of the 100 years reaching to 2020, two equally possible rates of increase may lead to a total population of european blood differing, according as the one or the other rate is employed, by more than one billion persons. two factors will chiefly determine the liberality of future increase. they are the food supply and the quality (both intellectual and physical) of the race. i venture, in closing, to invite your attention to the opinions of four distinguished students who have recently written upon aspects of these two subjects, from the standpoint respectively of food expert , historian, eugenist, and biologist. professor j. russell smith in his volume, the world’s food resources, published just after the war, observes: food we can have in abundance if we devote our time to the conquest of the earth and to the utilization of nature, rather than to conquest of each other. we have become dependent on a great fabric of trade. when it is destroyed, we die. it is only in the last hundred years, the century of steam and a sea clear of pirates, that man has begun to possess and utilize the earth to any great extent, and we are only at the beginning of the possibilities of such utilization. science every day enables us to have some new commodity where before there was waste. because of this creation, there is good reason to believe that the available resources of the world are increasing quite as rapidly as the population, and that they will continue to do so for a number of generations, if man devotes himself to science and industry rather than to war. professor smith further points out the necessary tendency toward a larger proportion of grains and vegetables and fish as population increases, and emphasizes the immense food possibilities of indian corn and sea life such as small floating mollusks. from such an exhaustive study as that made by professor smith a strong impression is created that limitation of population by lack of food is remote, though later generations may come to corn meal porridge. i confess, however, to some furtive doubts as to the virility and creative power of europeans a couple of generations have subsisted on mush and mollusks. but what of the quality of the race, what of its power and virility, its ability to grow by creating new means of subsistence, its ability to achieve? and achievement, let us remember, has been the dominant note of the past century. in europe, during the creative period just closed, the vast industrial awakening and development of transportation aroused the nations and inspired growth in all directions. in america, on the other hand, says the historian, in this instance the fluidity of life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating character. our early history is the study of european germs developing in environment. the transformations through which the united states is passing in our own day are so profound, so far reaching, that it is hardly an exaggeration to say that we are witnessing the birth of a new nation in america, these changes have been long in preparation, and are, in part, the result of world wide forces of reorganization incident to the age of steam and large scale industry. the future alone can reveal how much of the courageous creative spirit can be carried over in the new age which is replacing the era of free lands by complex industrial development and increasing resemblances and connections between the old world. these comments of the historian imply some solicitude for the future. there is a note of anxiety lest the man power of the republic, without the great objective of a continent to break and states to erect, and confined in thickly settled areas, may go stale. from a different point of view, the eugenist, professor samuel j. hoimes goes further. he quotes lapouge as asserting that “as civilization becomes more advanced, the evil effects of the various forms of social selection become more intense,” and then says : everywhere the nemesis of degeneracy hangs threateningly over the organic world. the attainment of any degree of complexity or perfection of organization is no guarantee against deterioration. there is not the slightest ground for believing that man himself is in any degree shielded from its insidious influence. of all our national resources, the most important is our supply of men of superior stock, and we are approaching a period in which the problem of the conservation of this resource is becoming more and more pressing. the trend of racial development has changed but however the process of racial fusion may work out, it is evident that the growing amalgamation of races and peoples, and the extension of civilization over the earth, will leave no room for the replacement of decadent products of civilization by superior stocks which have not yet been overtaken by culture. that civilization has a profound effect upon our biological development is a conclusion that cannot be escaped. in all countries increase of population has sooner or later to come to a standstill. increased means of production may for a while keep pace with growing numbers of inhabitants, but in time growth of population must bring about its own check. it is in his discussion of the declining birth rate, however, that professor holmes presents the most serious phase of the modern population problem. he says: the most serious menace to racial welfare, not only in america but in most civilized lands, is the relative sterility of superior types of humanity. we are losing the elements of our population that have achieved success financially, socially or in the field of intellectual achievement. speaking generally, none of these classes is reproducing itself. this condition is quite as bad in europe, at least in several countries, as in the united states. it constitutes a serious menace to our present social welfare and one which is striking at the very roots of our civilization. the menace is all the more dangerous because its effects do not, like those of war, pestilence and famine, intrude themselves upon our notice. the elements of the population that are of subnormal mentality exhibit at present the highest degree of fecundity. when we attempt to gain a comprehensive view of the forces which are changing human inheritance, it becomes apparent that those forces which have been called into action as the result of the development of our culture are in large part racially destructive. thus speaks the eugenist. a similar opinion, slightly more definite, has been expressed by the biologist. in the november issue of the atlantic monthly, professor vernon kellogg made an important contribution to the study of this subject. he says: as a matter of determined fact, most civilized nations are not having their succeeding generations well born. it is not merely the decline in the birth rate which we show in company with the nations of western europe that is so disturbing, but the fact that this decline is selective, and is most marked in those classes or parts of the population which we can least well afford to have reduced. with regard, in particular, to the matter of inherent that is, inherited low mental capacity, the revelations of the ingenious tests for intelligence to 1,700,000 drafted soldiers, show us amazing facts. the tests of these drafted soldiers showed that 4.5 of the examined men could be rated as of “very superior intelligence,” 9 percent “superior intelligence,” 16.5 percent “high average intelligence,” 25 percent “average intelligence,” 20 percent of “low average intelligence,” 15 percent of “inferior intelligence,” and 10 percent of “very inferior intelligence.” in a democracy like ours, such a representation of mental levels within the population gives one food for serious thought. what of the future of the evolution of the race? are we going to be capable, mentally capable, of making the most of the opportunities for racial progress which social evolution has put into our hands? the biologist stands aghast at what he sees happening. he knows what the consequences of 3outing nature are. what of the future of the republic? it can easily be claimed that some confirmation of these forecasts appears in the increasingly destructive tendencies of our own time; in the social changes; in extreme restlessness; in the irrational schemes for government and finance ; in the exaltation of hand toilers, accompanied by depreciation or actual persecution of the cultured, prosperous, and intellectual; in the persistent idea that everybody can reach the top, and by short cuts or force; in the systematic attempt to ignore mental inequalities. such things strongly suggest that in the whole social structure there is appearing an increasing proportion of the mentally dull. they may be in part, at least, post war phenomena, but it is clear that fear lest such an agree able explanation may not be adequate troubles many students of our time. “the most interesting question in the world,” says j. m. keynes, “is whether progress will be resumed, or whether the magnificent episode of the nineteenth century is over.” therefore, the worker in population statistics, impressed but not convinced, returns to his own point of observation. again he analyzes mere increase of population regardless of the causes producing such increase. he observes that the numbers of men remained extremely limited until our own time or near it, that this was followed by the evident release of the nations of Europe and america from those influences whatever they were which limited increase, and the subsequent rapid growth of population everywhere. he sees the assault by fast increasing millions upon the stored up resources of the earth at a rate insuring exhaustion at 190 very distant period if the drain continues unchecked. from such a survey it becomes clear that if the race still has ahead of it long centuries of anything more than mere existence, a new limiting influence is extremely likely to appear. are the eugenist and biologist already defining it? have they in these quoted sentences indicated the new and subtle power arising within man himself which in consequence he cannot overcome, in effect a new parasite to sap virility and compel men by a process, involuntary but irresistible, to increase the proportion of physically and mentally weak? thus, in the last analysis, is man to be made to burn himself out? by such a sinister process are all problems of increase to disappear, and is earth’s heritage, or what is left of it, by this means to be preserved for the possible use of generations to follow? these are questions of grave importance. as for myself, i am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. on the one hand, i cannot visualize the tribes of men continuing to increase at the rate indicated for the last century, at least without serious penalties. on the other, i cannot foresee early decay so that our descendants at no distant period shall become one with nineveh and tyre. between these two extremes there must be some foothold, but from his watch tower the worker in statistics beholds with awe the rising tide of mankind and the problems that rise with it in gravity and number. yet these signs are not conclusive.",214,24.5046728971963,4.90713196033562,0.25209763539283,5244,1322,18.0281877998531,13.0281877998531,39,0.526603890428803,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1923.10502088"

Persons","1908-1939","the general topic for discussion at the present annual meeting of the statistical association is, the statistical basis for analyzing the current economic situation, with the object of making forecasts of business conditions in general and for the great groups of economic activities in the united states. this topic explicitly recognizes that statistics may be effectively utilized not merely to describe the past, but as a basis for estimating present and future tendencies. the point of view thus indicated is neither new nor revolutionary. when the statistical society of london was organized in 1834, five years before our own association, the prospectus announced that its functions were to procure, arrange, and publish facts calculated to illustrate the conditions and prospects of society. the evaluation of the prospects of society was thus recognized in this early statement as a proper object of statistical research. it was not by accident that the idea of utilizing statistics of the past condition of society for inferences concerning the future appeared in the prospectus of 1834. that it was expressed deliberately and with comprehension of its significance is indicated by an interesting and pertinent incident in the organization of the london society, related by its former president. a statistical section of the british association for the advancement of science had been organized in 1833 in which the studies were limited to “facts relating to communities of men which are capable of being expressed by numbers, and which promise, when sufficiently multiplied, to indicate general laws. several men of eminence on statistics chafed at being thus relegated to the position of hewers and drawers for political economy and philosophy, so they joined in promoting the statistical society of london, now the royal statistical society, with the view of providing therein a wider scope for their inquiries. they considered it to be the function of the statistician to interpret and draw inferences from his statistics, and organized the statistical society for the purpose of furthering the development of that function. it is my object tonight to discuss some fundamental concepts of statistics. i will consider, particularly, the logical significance of a statistical exhibit, the nature of statistical inference, and some of the important concepts involved in making forecasts of economic conditions on the basis of statistical analyses of limited periods in the past. the necessity of the accumulation of statistics of the complex world of affairs in which we are immersed and the equal necessity of the development of special methods, different from those of the exact sciences, for summarizing these data have been admirably expressed in his history of european thought in the nineteenth century. that which everywhere oppresses the practical man, he says, is the great number of things and events which pass ceaselessly before him, and the flow of which he cannot arrest. what he requires is the grasp of large numbers. the successful scientific explorer has always been the man who could single out some special thing for minute and detailed investigation, who could retire with one definite object, with one fixed problem into his study or laboratory and there fathom and unravel its intricacies, rising by induction or divination to some rapid generalization which allowed him to establish what is termed a law or general aspect from which he could view the whole or a large part of nature. the scientific genius can stay the moment fleeting. the practical man cannot do this; he is always and everywhere met by the crowd of facts; by the relentlessly hurrying stream of events. what he requires is grasp of numbers, leaving to the professional man the knowledge of detail. thus has arisen the science of large numbers or statistics, and the many methods of which it is possessed. the contrast between the experimental method of the natural sciences and the statistical method of the social sciences may be expressed in greater detail. the natural scientist sets up and tries his experiment; repeats it as often as he pleases under the same or varying conditions; isolates the factor in which he is interested; and arrives at a demonstrable conclusion concerning the operation and effects of that factor. the social scientist, on the other hand, must accept and analyze the mixed situation as it comes to him; gather pertinent statistics, not such as he would like, but such as are available; study figures which embody the combined effects of many factors; and express his conclusions in terms of probabilities. it is obvious that the scope and nature of statistical inquiries are determined, in the first instance, by the extent and kind of records yielded by the relentlessly hurrying stream of events. many of these records, which constitute the material for statistical research, have resulted by accident rather than by design. for instance, in the seventeenth century the french government sold to a group of purchasers, bonds containing the provision that upon the death of any holder the income from his bond was to be distributed to the surviving holders; the record of this bond issue constituted the material for one of the first tables of mortality. but we need not go back to the seventeenth century for illustrations of the accidental origin of useful statistics. our figures for the personal distribution of incomes are a byproduct of tax administration; bank clearings are a consequence of the process of check collection; and figures for building permits have resulted from the regulation of urban construction. it is only in comparatively recent times that such statistical by products have been supplemented by special collections of data definitely planned, and designed to answer specific social or economic questions. and it is a still more recent development for various organizations, such as journals, trade associations, and governmental agencies, to collect and publish current data expressly for the purpose of estimating tendencies with the object of molding private and public policies. the body of new statistics which has been added to our store during the five years since the war shows that we are making rapid progress toward securing a more adequate statistical record of “ the relentlessly hurrying stream of events.” the boundaries of statistical research set by the material available, are obviously being widened, particularly in the field of economics. r u t it is not now my purpose to consider either these widening boundaries or their limitations upon research. my purpose, as i have said, is to consider the nature of the argument which proceeds from an examination of series of economic statistics, such as prices, interest rates, and the output of goods for consecutive time units in a given period. the primary function of an investigation of the economic statistics of a selected period of time is purely descriptive of that period.’ statistical devices, such as tables, charts, averages, measures of dispersion, lines or curves of trend, periodic functions, and coefficients of correlation, are not arguments. all of this machinery enables one merely to describe more or less completely and, at the same time, more or less simply, the economic fluctuations and inter relations of the given period. the inclusion of such a function as the coefficient of correlation among the descriptive devices of statistics indicates and emphasizes our point of view. keynes accurately characterizes the last named statistical device in these words, the mere existence of a particular correlation coefficient as descriptive of a group of observations, even of a large group, is not in itself a more conclusive or significant argument than the mere existence of a particular frequency coefficient would be. and a frequency coefficient, such as average wholesale prices or the ratio between bank loans and deposits, is of itself no argument, at all. so that the immediate result of any research in social statistics is merely the description of a limited field. but the statistician whom we are considering has not as his object the securing of an isolated description in a world of isolated descriptions. in the specific case which we are considering at the present annual meeting of the statistical association his object is the definite one of getting a notion of the economic prospects of society. to attain his end he has selected a suitable body of statistics and a period for study. back of this selection, back of the study itself, is a fundamental belief. the statistician, in common with every other scientific investigator, has a deep seated belief in the continuity and orderliness of affairs. the grasp of large numbers, the methodical array of figures and the registration of events, would in itself be of little use were it not for a fundamental assumption which appeals to common sense and has been confirmed by science, though it is hardly anywhere expressly stated namely, the belief in a general order, in a recurrent regularity or a slow but continuous change and orderly development of the things and events of the world. it may also be well to note that this belief in a general order is common to all schools of thought.” the recognition of this belief in a general orderliness of affairs is necessary if we are to understand the manner in which the statistician molds his investigation and arrives at a statistical inference. in the first place, he follows, as well as his material allows, the method of the experimental scientist when he selects, as a basis for forecasting, a past period for study as nearly as possible like that of the present. he at tempts to find a specific analogy existing in an orderly universe. but his aim is to draw an inference. he realizes that analogies differ greatly in their persuasive quality. the importance for an inference of a given statistical result pertaining to a given period is greatly increased, first, if similar or consistent statistical results obtain for sub periods; second, if similar or consistent statistical results obtain for other periods and under different circumstances; and third, if all of the statistical results agree with, are supported by, or can be set in the framework of, related knowledge of a statistical or non statistical nature. to illustrate the first point, if we have found, for instance, that a periodic function with a period of 40 months fits a time series of money rates for a span of 50 years the conclusion that there is a real period of 40 months for the entire span is strengthened if we obtain the same periodic function for each of two or more segments of the given 50 years. also, to illustrate the second point, the conclusion is further strengthened if the same function is found for other than the given 50 year span and its segments. likewise, the conclusion of a 40 month period would be further supported by the securing of evidence, statistical or otherwise, of corresponding fluctuations in business affairs. in other words, stability of statistical results and agreement with non statistical results are potent arguments for continued stability in an orderly universe. the method of argument just described is essentially empirical. oftentimes when arguments from statistics are so characterized the word “empirical” is used to classify statistical inference as a lower, and hardly respectable, order of human thought. it is not in this way that. i use the term. for i conceive that the term empirical means simply what belongs to or is the product of experience or observation, and that a stable empirical statistical result persisting over the entire range of our experience is precisely the same thing as a law of nature. you will say to me, there is nothing novel in the type of argument which you ascribe to the statistician; it is induction, neither more nor less. to this, i assent. but the statistician, you may continue, unlike other investigators deals with large numbers relating to classes of phenomena, in which, though it is impossible to predict what will happen in an individual case, there is nevertheless a significant regularity of occurrence if the phenomena be considered in successive sets. from this regularity, you say, and from the likeness of the stream of human events to games of chance, the mathematician has built up a technique of statistical probability. in this technique a given statistical series becomes a random sample and the various statistical devices used, such as averages and coefficients of correlation, consequently have determinable probable errors. from these probable errors we 6 statistical association [6 can state precisely the future result which we may reasonably expect. for instance,” you continue, “ the maximum coefficient of correlation between the monthly items of pig iron production and money rates for the period january 1903 july 1914 (133 pairs of items), after having made due allowance for secular trend and seasonal influences, is for a lag of 5 or 6 months in money rates and amounts to +0.75. the probable error of this coefficient is 0.03. the coefficient of correlation and the probable error together mean, according to the theory of inverse probability, that if we should take another sample of equal size the chances are equal that the resulting coefficient would he between. that is to say, one can state the mathematical probability that given economic relations will obtain in the future. this, you conclude, i is the special contribution of mathematical statistics to forecasting. the view that the mathematical theory of probability provides a method of statistical induction or aids in the specific problem of fore casting economic conditions, i believe, is wholly untenable. let us take a simple case. suppose we are considering the probability that 1924 will be a year of business depression and that we have the record of business conditions for the past 100 years in which there were 40 years of depression and 60 years of non depression. then, according to the statistical record, the probability that a year taken at random would be depressed is 4/10. but this probability cannot refer to 1924 unless that year is a random year, that is, unless we have no specific information that differentiates it from other years. in fact, we do have specific information about the economic conditions in 1923 and about the relation of economic conditions in consecutive years, which we cannot reasonably ignore, so that we cannot view 1924 as any year taken at random. every item of knowledge which we obtain bearing upon the situation in 1923 removes not only that year, but also 1924 one step further from its classification as random. such items of knowledge do not lead merely to continued revisions of the numerical probability that next year will! be a year of depression; rather, they render inapplicable the method of mathematical probability, to the problem of making a rational forecast. moreover, the actual statistical data utilized as a basis for forecasting economic conditions, such as a given time series of statistics for a selected period in the past, cannot be considered a random sample except in an unreal, hypothetical sense; that is to say, unless assumptions be made concerning our material which cannot be retained in actual practice. any past period that we select for study is, in fact, a special period with characteristics distinguishing it from other periods, and is not (‘random” with respect to the present. we must, therefore, discard statistical probability and arrive at a forecast for 1924 on another basis. there is a special objection to the application of the theory of probability to the particular economic data which constitute our material. if the theory of probability is to apply to our data, not merely the series but the individual items of the series must be a random selection. in fact, a group of successive items with a characteristic conformation constitutes our material. since the individual items are not independent, the probable errors of the constants of a time series, computed according to the usual formulas, do not have their usual mathematical meaning. thus, the “probable error” of 0.03 in a coefficient of correlation of +0.75 between the monthly items of pig iron production and money rates six months later does not indicate, as one would conclude from the theory of probability, that the chances are billions to one against the independence of the two variables; or, to state the idea more specifically, that if we compute a coefficient from data of any other actual period the chances are more than ten millions to one that its value would be over +0.50. in fact, the significance of the probable error of a constant computed from time series is not known, and, in practice, we do not view the world from the stand point of mathematical probability. so that we are not surprised when we actually find that the coefficient of correlation between the adjusted figures for pig iron production and money rates six months later for the period 1915 18 is only +0.38. we find sufficient explanation of this result, which is almost impossible and really astounding when viewed from the standpoint of random sampling, in the war demands for pig iron, the tremendous imports of gold, government financing, and the inauguration of the federal reserve system during the period in question. neither are we surprised when we find that €or the period 1919 23 the maximum correlation between the two series is for a lag in money rates, not of six months, but of nine to twelve months. for this period includes the severe crisis and great financial stringency of 1920 21, which dominated most of the items and hence the results. thus in actual practice the statistician cannot reasonably assume ignorance of the peculiar circumstances pertaining to the special cases which constitute his material, and therefore he does not think in terms of random sampling and numerical probabilities. granting as one must that consecutive items of a statistical time series are, in fact, related makes inapplicable the mathematical theory of probability. the thesis that statistical probabilities give us no aid in arriving at a statistical inference has been developed with great skill and which i have already quoted. summarizing his position, he says, in order to get a good scientific argument we still have to pursue precisely the same methods of experiment, analysis, comparison, and differentiation as are recognized to be necessary to establish any scientific generalization. these methods are not reducible to a precise mathematical form. but that is no reason for ignoring them, or for pretending that the calculation of a probability which takes into account nothing whatever except the numbers of instances, is a rational proceeding. generally speaking, therefore, i think that the business of statistical technique ought to be regarded as strictly limited to preparing the numerical aspects of our material in an intelligible form, so as to be ready for the application of the usual inductive methods. statistical technique tells us how to ‘count the cases’ when we are presented with complex material. it must not proceed also, except in the exceptional case where our evidence furnishes us from the outset with data of a particular kind, to turn its results into probabilities; not, at any rate, if we mean by probability a measure of rational belief. for the purposes of drawing inferences from economic statistics, in which the data are not of the particular kind indicated the theory of numerical probability gives no assistance. in particular, reasonable forecasts of economic developments can only be made by application of the usual methods of argument. to be sure, the conclusions of such arguments are expressed, not as certainties, but as probabilities. they are not, however, numerical probabilities. it is obviously impossible to state in terms of numerical probability a forecast or an inference based upon both qualitative and quantitative evidence; and even if all the evidence were quantitative, we have seen that it does not express a numerical measure of rational belief for the future. so when we say that (‘the conclusions of the social scientist are expressed in terms of probabilities’’ we merely mean that his conclusions do not have the certainty of those of the natural scientist. the probabilities of the economic statistician are not the numerical probabilities which arise from the application of the theorems of bernoulli and bayes; they are, rather, non numerical statements of the conclusions of inductive arguments.

Dublin","1908-1939","it is highly gratifying that the three societies meeting here tonight, all dedicated to the social sciences, are concerning themselves more and more with live issues and are devoting their energies to the solution of practical questions of the day. our membership, still largely composed of teachers and men of science, is to that extent cloistered and some what out of touch with the actual affairs of business and of politics. but so important have been the contributions of our members, that keen business men and administrators are learning to rely on them for guidance. everywhere, we see the close association of large business ventures with the best scientific thought of the country. the economist, the sociologist and the statistician, as well as the psychologist, the biologist and the chemist, are often the only ones able to solve the technical and even the practical problems that come up in the efficient conduct of business. it is consequently becoming more common for financiers, manufacturers, statesmen and administrators of public affairs to consult with those who have made special studies of the intricacies of social life, and to formulate their programs in line with the counsel given. through the channels of the newspaper, the magazine, and the forum, such as this, public opinion is being molded and social policies are being built upon a sound foundation of fact. the social sciences are decidedly coming into their own; their scope is expanding and a brilliant future is in store for them. under these conditions it is particularly fitting that the this is, of course, as it should be. statistical association should have chosen for discussion the population problem, which is today the most vital in life. perhaps no other question has developed such a variety of opinion or aroused greater antagonisms and prejudices. certainly none partakes of greater national and international significance. the world war was essentially an expression of the population problem confronting the nations of europe ten years ago. the crowding of the peoples of central europe was undoubtedly one of the underlying causes of the war. each country needed room for expansion and desired additional markets and colonies where surplus peoples could be accommodated and food could be raised for the use of the homeland. germany more than any other country was striving for a place in the sun and found her borders shadowed on the one hand by france and on the other by russia. to make matters worse, she felt a sense of superiority to france whose population she had far outstripped in numbers. the year 1914 seemed an opportune time to strike for more territory. the fears engendered in france and russia by an ever growing germany contributed to a state of mind which made war inevitable. this is an outstanding example of an almost universal condition. in the balkan countries, the same situation prevailed; each dreamed of a greater greece, or bulgaria, or Romania, as the case might be, which could only be realized at the expense of a neighboring country. in japan the pressure of population on the island kingdom has been intense and accounts for its desire to spread out to unsettled areas near at hand and to seize opportunities for migration to america and especially to australia. this has produced hostile reactions in australia, the united states, and south america, who have closed their doors against the japanese. such suspicions and recriminations are responsible for the rapid growth of the war spirit. these are instances of the sinister international aspect of the population problem. but, within individual countries the population problem often takes on queer expression in an exaggerated feeling of nationalism and exclusiveness. in the united states it has given rise to two movements: first, the new immigration policy, and second, the ku klux klan. Essentially, both are an expression of a similar psychology. they express the point of view of a great mass of native americans in all parts of the country, which may be summed up in the slogan america for s. what underlies these phenomena is, first of all, a distrust of the newcomer, resentment at his success, and the far engendered by his greater fertility and rapid increase in numbers after his arrival the adherents of the klan see themselves losing control of the country. their formation of an organized group, then, is really the expression of a defense reaction to the passing away of power from their own hands and its concentration in that of aliens whom they consider inferior, or, in any case, unable to conduct properly the affairs of the country. essentially the same reasoning is at the bottom of the new immigration law which admits into the country only a limited number of aliens selected from the few countries whose peoples and standards of life most closely resemble our own. the stream of papers and books in recent years which has crystallized into an organized propaganda for the nordic races in america is simply an effort to give the appearance of respectability and of science to what is fundamentally an expression of unreasoned prejudice. such sentiments and passions often lead, as we have seen, to hastily considered legislation. laws based not on accurate information or calm, logical reasoning, are passed only to be later repealed after irreparable damage has been done. had the statistician been consulted in the first place, much of this futility could have been averted. his function is primarily to get the facts, to analyze them, to weigh their relative importance, and then to arrive at a conclusion based upon the evidence. from the beginning, the study of population has been the statisticians special concern. in fact, he made his first real contribution in this field and thus earned his name. for was not the statistician at the end of the eighteenth century the man who concerned himself with the affairs of the state, who made inquiries respecting populations, the production and resources of the country, who recorded and organized available knowledge describing the human beings of the state? if anyone can solve such an intricate social problem, it should be the statistician who, after two centuries of study, can be expected to make a contribution of the first rank to this vexing question, and introduce order, logic, and understanding where now only confusion reigns. the population question, important everywhere, is today most pressing in the united states. the problem in the countries of europe and asia is acute enough; but the issue is clearer, because those parts of the world have practically reached a saturation point and possess in most cases a population fairly homogeneous with reference to blood and culture. it is not too much to say that the hope of the world rests on a happy and successful solution of our population question. canada, australia and the south states are facing much the same problem as we are, and any conclusions we may reach will be of great value to them also. the population problem of the united states has two main aspects; in this country, the future is still in the making. the first quantitative, and the second qualitative. under the first is implied an understanding of the facts of our population both from the point of view of structure and of movement, in the past and currently. it presupposes a consideration of the possibilities of future growth; the determination of the maximum numbers which can be supported, and when this figure is likely to be reached. our discussion must include also the relationship between the increase in numbers and the natural resources of the country agricultural, mineral and littoral. all of these factors are considered in the first, two sessions of our program. under the second or qualitative aspect of our discussion we are thinking about such elements as the present constitution of the country racially; the contribution which the various racial stocks have made to our common cultural life; and our attitude regarding the future com position of the country. this involves the discussion of a rational immigration policy which is the main subject of our third session. there is, however, another consideration which is neither exclusively quantitative nor purely qualitative in character but partakes of both and must receive very careful consideration. our future well being will depend upon the standards of life we desire, upon the efficiency with which we manage our resources, and upon the efficient training and direction of our labor supply with due regard to the utilization of the labor of the women and children. these questions are considered in our fourth session. our final meeting seeks to formulate a program, outline a technique and present a goal for the future. we will attempt to sketch the type of civilization that we may hope to achieve; its internal economic and social organization; the composition and organization of the family unit. we must endeavor to understand how the age at marriage will influence the size of the family; the part played by schooling and training; what conditions best enable the individual to cope with his environment; what vocational equipment is necessary; whether the public health movement and the improvement in environmental conditions have contributed to an increase of the weaklings of society; whether our vast system of charitable and poor relief has only served to provide a cheap but inadequate labor supply. we must seek constantly to keep in touch with the facts as they develop from day to day, so that we may always gauge the changes that occur, and determine whether we are working towards our objective or have deviated from it; we must decide in what direction we are going, and to what ultimate end. our fifth session should in this way develop a clearer methodology for the study of the population problem of the future. as you see, these are the elements which compose our program. our discussions will branch out into every field of science and draw upon the entire body of existing knowledge. but it is impossible in a limited number of sessions to cover all the ramifications of the population problem. no reference will be made, for example, to the most important and perplexing problem presented by the presence of the negro in the population. this subject would itself justify a full symposium and we have, therefore, thought best not to raise the issue at all by giving it only scant consideration. and there are other phases of the population problem which we have likewise omitted. it is a pleasure at this time to acknowledge the enthusiastic support of all the scientists participating in our program; and it is particularly gratifying to find that our society could, at short notice, produce from its own ranks so many men admirably qualified to treat such a variety of topics in an authoritative manner. we have demonstrated in the formation of this program that it is possible for students in various branches of scientific research to get together and cooperate in the advancement of knowledge and its application to social problems. the combined result of our symposium should produce a work on population worthy of the statistical association, and one so obviously reliable that it must surely influence current public opinion. our efforts have been materially stimulated by the early offer of the pollak foundation which promises to issue as a volume of their publications the papers read here. our speakers will present a wide variety of views and give their personal interpretation of the facts. this is no cut and dried affair reflecting one mans judgment. the freest play of opinion has been encouraged, because we clearly realize that the population problem still involves many uncertain factors. there are still too many nonstatistical elements complicating the picture, which may at any moment call for a very different approach to all population estimates. a realization of any one of a number of experiments now being con ducted in the laboratories of the chemists and physicists to produce synthetically some of our common foodstuffs, such as sugar, would revolutionize our whole social economy and throw into a cocked hat all previous estimates of an optimum population. at all events, the subject has not yet reached a point where definite and immutable laws can be established. we can, however, ferret out the facts in the case, and give to those best qualified to speak, an opportunity to present them. our hope is that the various contributions may be sufficiently interrelated to form a more or less continuous, coherent and convincing story. one would think that having arranged such a program, your president would more or less gracefully pass into the background and leave the discussion to those chosen to consider specific topics. i had at first wished to do so; but, on consideration, have decided to participate, if only mildly. certain phases of our problem have interested me for years and it is hard to resist the opportunity to join such an excellent company. my effort will be to present a few comments on methodology and attempt to supply a unifying principle which will coordinate our many sided discussion. the first point i wish to make is to warn against the error of generalizing from crude and temporary relationships. a number of statisticians have assumed that the future growth of the country will keep pace with the increase in past decades without giving due consideration of the underlying factors which have caused that increase. this has led them to forecast future populations of enormous size which at an early date would tax the very limits of our natural resources. no wonder, therefore, that they are pessimistic and urge the most drastic limitation of immigration and restriction of our fecundity. what items have they overlooked? professor willcox, from a critical analysis of population statistics, infers that a natural decline in the native birth rate began as early as 1810 and that it has continued since that time.' at any rate it is certain that there has been a long continued decrease. this decline has received very little attention because it has not stood out clearly, its effects having been covered up partly by the improvement in mortality, and partly by the immigration movement. the very large increase in our numbers which has characterized the past fifty years has been due in a large measure to immigration and to the results of immigration. in 1920, the foreign born whites constituted 13 percent of the population. since 1900, well over sixteen million foreigners have come here the gross immigration averaging over a million each year for the five years ending june l914. not only must we count the total number of new comers admitted into the country, but we must realize that they come from fertile peoples accustomed for centuries to large families, and that coming here, for the most part, during their reproductive years, they have produced large numbers of offspring soon after their arrival. accordingly, we find in 1920 that the native born of foreign parentage constituted 14.8 percent (in addition to the 13 percent mentioned and the native born of mixed parentage another 6.6 percent. this makes the foreign stock in 1920 over a third of the total population of the country. today, the picture is on the way to being completely changed. the recent restrictions on immigration will take good care that our future increase of population will not come from that source. more and more, it will result from the excess of births over deaths in the native born population; and, if present indications are any guide, the phenomenal growth of the past will never again be repeated. already in 1920, the native stock residing in the urban areas was scarcely re placing itself the country over. there are also clear indications that among the foreign stock the size of the families varies in direct proportion with the length of time they have lived in the united states. with immigration restricted, every population forecast that i know must be revised with due regard to the relative fecundity of stocks now composing the population. we shall, therefore, be con fronted with the reality of a stationary population much sooner than any of our forecasters have imagined. my second comment is to advise against easy solutions of the population problem. those who have been most distressed by the rapid increase in our population in recent decades have, for the most part, urged the more general practice of birth control, which has seemed to them the simplest and most direct way out of our trouble. to discuss in detail the subject of birth control would take more time than i have at my disposal, and some of its phases at least will be considered by others. i desire only to show how dangerous are the implications in this panacea. the assumption seems to be that birth control is a new force which would substitute order and intelligence for the present haphazard and indiscriminate growth of population. but, the facts appear to be otherwise. the practice of birth control is nothing new; nor has it been limited to one group of people, namely, the better circumstanced. in no other way can we account for the rapid decline in the birth rate in the united states and in other countries. it was over 30 per thousand only fifteen years ago in those cities which kept accurate figures; it is now little over 20. this represents a drop of 30 percent during a period of generally increasing prosperity, of rising wages, and of other favorable factors which ordinarily increase the birth rate. every doctor, every nurse, and every social worker knows how powerful is the force of birth control among the people at the present time. the researches of others, demonstrate this fully. birth control is nothing new in life. it has been for years and is increasingly today the established practice among city dwellers who belong to the salaried classes. it must, therefore, be considered in our discussion frankly and fully and its effects must be carefully weighed and determined before it receives further sanction from presumably authoritative sources. the recent change in our immigration laws, on the one hand, and the practice of birth control, on the other, will very soon produce a population situation essentially different from that of the last generation. we must be prepared at a comparatively early date for a stationary population unless we completely change our present attitude toward the foreigner and modify our approval of small families. such a reversal is not likely to take place, because we like, as a nation, to indulge our sense of exclusiveness and superiority. moreover, giving birth to a very few children apparently offers many personal advantages and appeals to the average family, which is much more concerned with the immediate increase of comfort than with abstract principles of obligation to country or to mankind in general. we may, therefore, expect current tendencies to become more fixed and intensified and to find that we will before long approach the condition of a stationary population. it will clarify our discussion at this point if we consider the number of births that it requires under present conditions of mortality to keep a population stationary. according to the mortality and marital conditions prevailing in 1920, out of every thousand females born, 788 will eventually marry. in other words, we must count on 788 married women to give birth to a thousand daughters in order to re place the thousand from which they sprang. to put it another way, a thousand married women must have 1,268 daughters to replace them selves under present mortality conditions. likewise, it can be shown that a thousand married men must be the fathers of 1,350 sons in order to replace themselves. combining our figures, we find that one thousand families, on the average, must have 2,618 children, which means that each family must, on the average, during the reproductive period, produce 2.6 children to replace the original quota from which the parents sprang. not all families have children, however; for, at the present time, about one marriage in six is either sterile or does not lead to live issue. the burden of child bearing, therefore, falls on the remaining families, who must bring into the world an average of not 2.6, but 3.1 children. the family unit, must, therefore, average 5.1 persons (including all the children born to fertile mothers, not merely the children living at any given moment). all groups of urban american families recently studied have shown that the average number of children born to a completed marriage is barely sufficient to maintain a stationary population. it is only when the rural areas of the country are included that the figures show a substantial natural increase. the distinguished mathematician in my office, and i, have recently made an excursion into this field and have uncovered a number of highly interesting and even surprising situations. as the result of the higher birth rates of past generations there is at the present time an abnormally large number of persons at the reproductive ages of life, and this tends to increase the current birth rate. we have calculated what the present birth rate would be if the age distribution at the reproductive ages were the result of a prolonged continuation of our present rate of procreation (that is, births per annum, per potential mother of a given age). the effect would be to reduce the figure from 23.4 per 1,000, the present figure, to 20.9. in other words, what maintains for the time being our birth rate is not our inherently high re productive vitality, but rather the fact that the surviving descendants of a more highly reproductive generation are today swelling the ranks of middle life and participating in parenthood. they thus lend a spurious appearance of vigorous growth to an otherwise meagerly reproducing population. at the same time a second result of this padding is to reduce the death rate disproportionately, because the ages of early adult life have very low mortality rates. if the correction were made for an age distribution on the basis of the present life table and the present rate of procreation, the death rate, instead of being 12.4, as it is now, would become 15.3. the effect of these two corrections would be to reduce the rate of natural increase from 11 per thou sand to only 5.5 per thousand per annum, that is, to reduce it to one half of its present value. this means that, aside from the transitory benefits of past high birth rates which for a while we are still enjoying, we are actually increasing at the rate of only 5.5 per thousand per annum, instead of at a rate of 11 per thousand, per annum. equally interesting is the result of our investigation into the effect of the recent improvement in mortality. the last five or ten years have seen a marked diminution in mortality rates, which has had the effect of increasing the rate of natural increase. if we should calculate the rate of natural increase of our population at our present rate of pro creation and at the mortality rate of 1910, the result would be a rate of natural increase of only 3.6 per thousand per annum; and if we should go back to the mortality conditions of 1901, the present rate of pro creation would barely keep 9 s from the down grade. the rate of natural increase would then be reduced to virtually zero. we should then have a condition of a stationary population. these figures bring home clearly how close to the danger line we are now going. we must exercise particular care, as we approach the point of a stationary population, not to weaken its internal composition by in creasing the proportion of defective stock. this is all the more important because a stationary population inevitably contains a relatively greater number of older persons than a growing population. the support of these more advanced age groups falls in part upon the young people, who must, therefore, face the prospect, in coming years, of carrying a greater burden than has fallen to their share in the past. we are here confronted with a vicious circle; for the greater the burden placed on young people, the fewer will be their children, and this will mean still fewer young people at the reproductive period in the next generation. if a population can increase in a geometric ratio, it can also decrease in the same ratio. this is the real danger. probably nothing that we can do will alter the tendency among the great mass of s to reduce the size of their families. reproduction will, hereafter, be more and more determined by intelligence and restraint. excessive breeding should receive scant approval anywhere. we must aim at this time not for numbers at the expense of quality; but rather seek to develop a well organized and happy society. that is the objective which should animate every student of population, every statesman and every thoughtful citizen. we must be careful, however, about the way we take to arrive at this goal. merely wiping out our natural increase by the first means at hand will not do it. we must not substitute real and serious troubles of a new sort for minor and even imaginary old ones. we must not, above all, forget that population mistakes are not easily remedied; that when they are once made and their effects have become visible, it is usually too late to correct them. thus far, we have considered the quantitative aspect of the population problem. when we turn to the qualitative side of the question, there are just as many misconceptions rife in our current thinking. my third suggestion, therefore, toward a unified theory of population, is that our approach be democratic and not aristocratic in character. it has been fashionable in recent years to lament the non fertility of the native stock and the fecundity of the newcomer. it has been assumed that the older races and especially those of nordic origin are innately superior. the contributions of the various race stocks to our life will be discussed by the anthropologists participating in our program. i desire only at this point to sound a warning against too ready acceptance of a theory which establishes sharp class distinctions without sufficient scientific proof. certainly at the present time, evidence is hardly sufficient to warrant the sweeping conclusion that certain racial elements in our national life are vastly superior to others. reflecting very much the same aristocratic bias of which i have spoken is the current view, especially pronounced among biological writers on population, that the country is headed for disaster because of the greater fertility of the masses as contrasted with that of the classes. the literature associated with the eugenic movement has overstressed the dangers implied in the differential birth rate. beware of reproducing from mediocrity, is the warning. there is often a thinly disguised plea for a race of supermen who, presumably, could spring only from the upper social and economic strata. the common man has little place in this scheme of things, although he does, after all, make up the bulk of the population. this basic assumption should be thoroughly tested, even though its acceptance does flatter our self esteem and reflect the paganism of our times. i seriously question its validity and consider this attitude a very crude and unjustified application of biological jargon to human life. its chief defect lies in its almost total disregard of the influence of environment and tradition on our conduct and achievement. it is, moreover, a direct challenge to our best ideals of democracy and religion. when we have eliminated the upper and lower 10 percent of our population, there is not sufficient indication of serious differences in innate ability among the remaining 80 percent to justify the current fears and warnings against their deliberate participation in parenthood. they are neither spectacularly able nor do they abound in defects. if they lack the brilliance which would single them out for special distinction, they have usually other compensating, valuable and attractive qualities. they are just plain folks carrying on the worlds work. we see on all sides clear evidence of the ability of ordinary people to give birth to children capable of the highest achievements as opportunity and environment release their power. our social organization by its very complexities and the perfection of its mechanical foundations, is conducive to stimulating the innate abilities of men from all walks of life, which in a less well organized society might go to waste. throughout all ages the leaders of mankind have come predominantly from homes which at first sight seemed most unpromising and commonplace. will not the leadership of the next generation come, as it always has in the past, from that source? for these reasons, i consider the newer tendencies and movements in the population far from inimical to our institutions and to the best traditions of the country. if we can be careful to control, or better yet entirely check, the reproduction of the obviously unfit, we are in no danger of racial deterioration. there has always been a differential birth rate and a replacement of one group of people above, by another equally good from below. in all ages, men have raised themselves above their inherited station in life and have occupied the seats of the mighty, left vacant by those considered their superiors who have neglected, or have been incapable of performing their highest obligation to society, namely, parenthood. i make no pretense at having solved this difficult problem; but we must in all fairness examine critically the current point of view and shift the emphasis in our population discussion from a glorification of the upper strata to a more generous recognition of the inherent worth of the great mass of mankind. in the last analysis, the contribution of the statistician to the population question must square with common sense and with the best traditions of our country and our times.

1925,"20th","Chaddock, Robert E.","Male","Columbia University","Academia","87th","December 28–31, 1925","New York City, NY",NA,"The Function of Statistics in Undergraduate Training",1925-12-28,"Robert E. Chaddock","1908-1939","the function of statistics in undergraduate training has not yet been clearly defined. as a matter of course, statistical methods have been introduced in technical and professional schools and in universities as means to accomplish desired results, as equipment for research in sociology and economics, in education, in biometry, in the practical affairs of business and social organization. elementary courses must frequently be given in these specialized fields to post graduate students merely as an introduction to the advanced methods required for their particular work. statistical training has been introduced at the top of our educational scheme. it places emphasis upon technique rather than upon a method of attack, a mode of thought, a procedure for analysis and comparison of complex factors. the advanced student, especially in the social sciences, has left behind, usually with no regrets, the exact methods of his mathematical studies because he does not expect to apply them. equations, which have aided in solving the unknown from a knowledge of the known; logarithms, which are effective tools in computation; the characteristics of lines and curves, which today are utilized effectively to describe the phenomena of social and industrial life and to illuminate their explanation all these and much more have been forgotten because the student, as he begins his studies in the social sciences, has not been shown their significance in his work. it is only when there is little time to repair these neglected things that the professional and research worker faces the need for this technical equipment. the engineer has no such difficulty because he understands early in his training what is needed. likewise, students in the natural sciences at the start are introduced to the experimental laboratory. they learn to observe accurately, to assemble and classify data, to sift evidence. they begin at once to acquire the habit of independent and cautious generalization from known facts. it requires hard work. it is our belief that statistics can be made to serve for the social sciences a function similar to that which the experimental or laboratory method has served in the physical sciences. undergraduates who major in the social sciences have usually had at least one laboratory science, but they find that the experimental method has serious limitations in the complex relations of human society. therefore, it is with difficulty that they carry over into their social studies scientific principles gained from their laboratory experience. the beginning work in these subjects is still too largely deductive in character. principles and generalizations of economics and sociology are found to be too inflexible. they should be related to the concrete situations of experience and should be modified in the light of the facts. from an examination of new data new explanations arise. my thesis is that the undergraduate majoring in the social sciences must have special training in the inductive scientific method applied to these fields, and that he should have it early in his work as a fundamental educational equipment. a course in elementary statistical methods should be given, as laboratory courses are now given to beginners in the physical sciences. this course would bring students into intelligent contact with the facts of our social, economic and political life, an increasing number of which are expressed in quantitative form; it would place emphasis upon accuracy of information, upon valid methods of analysis and comparison, and upon caution in generalizing; and it would aid in describing the situations of every day life without premature theorizing. moreover, approaching social studies mainly from the deductive point of view, the student frequently acquires early in his work faulty habits of using quantitative data and of thinking about them. he is likely to call to his aid only such facts as illustrate or confirm conclusions arrived at deductively. in this case he neither verifies the truth of his premises nor makes adequate tests of his conclusions. the one cannot be separated from the other without marring the effectiveness of both. the use of the inductive method requires rigorous training in scientific procedures. we are permitting the undergraduate in the social sciences to become lost in a wilderness of concrete data and badly supported general statements without showing him how to find the laboratory technique is not easy to acquire. inductive methods should go hand in hand with the deductive. his own way about. he has not yet acquired the wariness and wisdom that scientific training gives, and he is lured constantly on false trails, due to the bias of his hopes and enthusiasms. we have an obligation of first importance to remedy this situation. the elements of statistical method given as a fundamental discipline to undergraduates will furnish them with the broad foundations for scientific work and will cultivate their critical judgment of facts and explanations offered by others. for this purpose statistics should not be conceived in any narrow or professional sense. it is not merely technique or a branch of mathematical science. it is concerned with a body of principles and methods developed to guide the student in assembling and in handling quantitative data. it is a point of view, a method of attack. it involves measurements, countings and estimates, a careful record, intelligent groupings, discriminating analysis, logical comparisons, clear presentations, and cautious weighing of evidence. there are principles and procedure common to many different fields of work. these constitute the unity of the subject. we can leave the special methods to be developed and applied to particular problems by professional and research workers. recent changes, both in the emphasis on particular subjects in the college course and in the methods and content of these subjects, have made clearer the need for a broad elementary training in statistics for undergraduates. the older course of study, during the first two years, carried forward subjects begun in preparatory and high school. the student was trained in formal logic, in deductive thinking, in the precise methods of mathematical demonstration, in the laboratory technique of the natural sciences, in the broad historical backgrounds from which current social, economic, and political movements have emerged. upon this educational foundation was built the work of the last two years of college in the social sciences government, economics, sociology, and the philosophy of history. emphasis was placed not upon specialization but upon relationships in a complex society. the aim was broadly cultural. the lines of demarcation between subjects could not be sharply drawn. perhaps even now they cannot be. the methods of study in sociology and economics have been historical and comparative and largely deductive. premises and assumptions were laid down, and logical reasoning was depended upon to evolve a system of theory and explanation of phenomena. the facts of experience were appealed to usually for illustrative purposes or for precise description, not for the purpose of verifying premises or modifying conclusions in the light of new data. formal logic, even if effective training for deductive reasoning, gave little help to the student in checking up his conclusions. it remains for training in statistical methods to tie up logical processes directly with the concrete facts of every day life. the viewpoint of college educators has changed in response to the practical spirit of the times. early specialization is now the tendency. what was formerly post graduate or professional study is now well advanced before the student receives his bachelors degree. in the last two years of college he selects courses which prepare him for specific professional work business, engineering, medicine, law, teaching. the program of studies in the first two years of college has been modified to meet this new situation. the fundamental preparation, technical and cultural, formerly distributed over four years, is more closely confined to the first two years of the college course. elementary courses in economics, sociology, and government are being introduced in the sophomore year in college or earlier. mathematics and the classical languages are being displaced, so far as social science students are concerned, in favor of so called practical subjects. the effort is made to give emphasis to the interdependence of social studies by introducing a general descriptive and comparative course, as illustrated by contemporary civilization in columbia college, given to freshmen five hours per week. this course furnishes a coordinated background for special courses in sociology, economics, government, history, and philosophy undertaken in the following years. it is designed to be an orientation course in the world of ideas. this change in emphasis upon subjects in the early years of the college course is accompanied by a change in the content and the method of approach to social studies. inductive methods are being rapidly adopted to supplement older deductive procedures in arriving at a reasonable understanding of organized society and of human behavior. this understanding of group behavior gives a common purpose to all the social sciences which deal with its different aspects. the quantitative analysis of recorded behavior in a kinetic society requires a common method the statistical. the accumulation of quantitative data and the development of appropriate methods for handling them have been slow. the student of even thirty five years ago gave little attention to statistical studies because both data and methods were lacking. recent years have witnessed a rapid development of both. the very rapid accumulation of quantitative data descriptive of instruction in the social sciences is begun in the high school. events threatens to confuse the beginner. he is tempted to read too much and to think too little. we have speeded up his approach to social studies at the same time that the materials with which he works have multiplied in volume and complexity. there are many pitfalls in using concrete data gathered and presented by many writers and investigators for various purposes, describing conditions where the factors are many, the variations wide, and the units difficult to define. these pitfalls can be avoided only by developing a healthy skepticism of so called facts and a knowledge of scientific methods. furthermore, facility in the use of scientific methods cannot be acquired by talking about them. they are acquired by doing by trial and error and by hard work with actual data. one of the chief criticisms of the writings and discussions in the social sciences is too much dependence upon unchecked generalities and too little patient effort with the underlying facts upon which the validity of conclusions depends. jumping at positive conclusions from insufficient or crude data is a bad habit, we all admit, but the problem is how to prevent our students from acquiring this habit. one answer is training in statistical methods as early as possible in the undergraduate preparation. let us build our social science structure upon due regard for facts and caution in their use, and upon correct habits of thought. in his history of thought in the nineteenth century, after describing how the successful investigator in physical science has always been the man who could single out some special thing for minute investigation, who could retire with one definite object into his study or laboratory and there fathom and unravel its intricacies, explains the difficulties of the practical man. that which everywhere op presses the practical man is the great number of things and events which pass ceaselessly before him, and the flow of which he cannot arrest. what he requires is the grasp of large numbers. he is always and everywhere met by the crowd of facts; by the relentlessly hurrying stream of events. thus has arisen the science of large numbers or statistics and the many methods of which it is possessed. here is clearly stated the contrast between the experimental method of natural science and the statistical method of the social sciences. the work of experimenting, when possible at all, requires a different technique in the social sciences. the investigator as a rule must rely far more on statistical methods and safeguards. he must observe a complex situation as he finds it, for the most part; he must analyze it and secure measurements if he can, not such as he would prefer under ideal controlled conditions, but such as are available; he must scrutinize his facts and determine the representative character of the samples before generalizations can be established; and he must state his conclusions in terms of probabilities. statistical results describe concrete situations and relationships in a limited field. crude quantitative data, widely employed at present for precise description, are likely to convey wrong impressions and to lead to errors of interpretation. therefore, statistical devices have been invented to refine the raw data and to make our description of phenomena simpler and more reliable. tables, graphic devices, rates, percentages, averages, index numbers, measures of dispersion and measures of relationships the elementary methods used in statistical analysis, are devices to describe as simply and adequately as possible the relentlessly hurrying stream of events. these simple scientific methods the undergraduate should know. detect errors of fact and fallacious inferences and presentations which he encounters in the course of his daily work? of course the ultimate aim of scientific investigation is to be able to draw inferences from established facts and relations, to arrive at a sound scientific argument and to detect a false one. the statistical procedures, however, are preliminary to this final step the results of statistical analysis are the foundation upon which the inferences rest. all too often conclusions are formulated before the facts are examined. it is not the purpose of this paper to set forth in detail the content of a course in elementary statistical methods for undergraduates. we wish only to inquire what functions such a course should serve in college training and why it should be given in college at all. if all the social sciences are beginning to use statistical methods, clearly, this beginning course should not be specialized in any single field. it should emphasize methods and procedures which are applicable in any or all fields. why should we duplicate teaching effort by giving the same elementary principles of statistics in each of the social sciences? this course offers an opportunity to emphasize the relationships between the subjects taught and to develop unity in the social sciences by the use of a com mon method. only incidentally should the course convey factual in formation. the facts chosen from various sources familiar to the students experience should serve primarily as the basis for training in scientific methods. the object is not to give to the student simply a command of formulas and processes. the use of the statistical method, as of scientific methods generally, requires constructive imagination and ability to guard against wrong inferences and ability to detect them in the work of others. the usual sources of errors are of a very elementary sort. how else can we hope? we shall now summarize some of the most important services which 1. develops the critical judgment of the student. figures may speak for themselves but not necessarily the truth. the student should learn their language. he requires principles, not difficult but simple ones, which enable him to judge of the credibility of quantitative results. the independent, thinking student must cultivate skepticism of his own conclusions and those of other people. he faces masses of quantitative data in so called statistical reports. he should be able to discriminate between reliable and unreliable sources. by studying examples of misuses of statistical data he can develop the ability to discover fallacies and sources of errors. science is getting at facts and trying to understand them. the scientific attitude of mind prompts the student to seek evidence which will appeal as true to other minds as to his own. he must ask, what do the figures represent? how were they collected? what is included in the table or chart? are the data relevant to the situation described? are they adequate? what are the shortcomings of the data? are they comparable? are they properly classified? classification is the foundation of scientific knowledge. especially in the social sciences where factors are many and varied and where human sympathies are keen it is difficult to free judgments from the bias of desires and feelings wishful thinking. quantitative data are objective and can be freed more easily from bias than subjective opinions. we would not make professional statisticians out of sophomores or juniors in college if we could, but elementary training in statistics offers the opportunity to work with concrete data and to develop the inductive method of attacking problems. early statistical training prevents the development of bad habits in the use of quantitative data. it provides the student with the fundamentals of the necessary technique for professional work in both the natural and the social sciences. it develops a scientific attitude of mind as a part of his educational equipment. if he does not contemplate advanced academic work it gives him an intellectual equipment highly valued in the world of business and social organization. elementary statistical training can render to the undergraduate : 2. emphasizes the essentials of scientific method. 3. prepares for advanced work. 4. helps the student to realize the interdependence of different factors in a given situation, and to describe relationships of cause and effect. the factors of a complex situation can be observed, measured, classified and compared, even when they cannot be controlled for a genuine experiment, as in the natural sciences. descriptions and comparisons of complex situations require the use of statistical methods. 5. supplements deductive processes. furnishes means of checking up"" general statements. ties up logical processes with concrete situations, and emphasizes logical consistency. the quality of mind we call common sense is really logical consistency. we are not born with it: it must be cultivated. statistical training aids in its development. 6. by making and interpreting graphic representations of statistical data and by constructing tables, the student gains an understanding of the continuity of series of variables and their relations to each other. he begins to observe the stability in results obtained from the analysis of large numbers of cases. he realizes that the basis of belief in future occurrences lies in past experience. this is the fundamental concept of prediction. the making and using of graphs also develop the critical abilities of the student. the fallacies are many and often concealed in the data themselves, as well as in the methods of constructing the diagrams. visualization of the data aids in discovering errors and in suggesting new ideas. 7. finally, an elementary course can preserve useful mathematical concepts by showing their application to social data. it is probability, not certainty.

been unable to fill the position, and have made other arrangements. their explanation of the matter to me is that when they considered the qualifications of statisticians recognized as young, progressive leaders in the profession they found that they could not read the statistical material that these men had published, and could not understand what the statisticians were talking about when they tried to discuss it with them. they were no better off when they found statistical workers whose writings and discussions they could comprehend, for they found that these men were not generally regarded by their fellow workers as really being in the first rank among skilled statisticians. we should be gratified that a business firm was willing to offer so high a salary to fill a statistical position. and we should be concerned that statisticians appeared to find a negative correlation between ability and lucidity. how shall we explain this? the fact is that the science of statistics has entered a new era, and is now at a stage of development where the extensions of its methodology have outstripped the arts of exposition necessary to tell about them. the great war marked the transition from the old to the new statistics. we are met in the eighty eighth annual convention of the statistical association, but this is only the twentieth annual presidential address. the published records of these meetings during the decade before the war show that those presidential addresses deplored the fact that the association had not introduced any new methods to statisticians, commented on the lack of trained workers, and claimed that the universities had failed in their attempts to teach statistics. i think it can fairly be said that when the speakers on these occasions before the war directed their attention to the problems of the profession their pleas were for the development of methods, and for the training of statisticians. if we look back as far as thirty years we find that general walker, addressing the association in washington in 1896, said: do not know of a single man now holding, or who has ever held, a position in this country as the head of a statistical bureau, or as chief of a statistical service, or as a statistician, who has had any elementary training for his work. ten years ago the great war was tearing at the vitals of civilization. when we entered it there arose an insistent call for statistics, but in banking terms the call was for statistics on demand, and not for statistics on time. now previous to the war most statistical work was carried on by the government, and most of the series of data were published in annual figures, which were likely to be available about eighteen months after the end of the year. the pursuit of statistics was in the main rather leisurely, somewhat academic, and usually remote from practical use. the data of government, business, and finance are available monthly, weekly, and even daily. the fields of inquiry have enormously multiplied. well trained statisticians have appeared, and many of them. there arises on every hand the demand that statistics shall be published and interpreted currently, and that they shall be projected into the future. now these demands for statistical forecasts are in reality merely new and difficult phases of an ancient problem. society has always asked for prophecy, and always demanded it of the statistician, for all human prophecy is statistical. but exact prophecies have been possible only in the exact sciences, and as soon as they have become exact society has given them special names, and entrusted their extension to special groups, so that they are not now known as statistics. the measurement of time, the marking of the passage of the years, the forecasting of the procession of the seasons was probably the earliest branch of statistical prophecy. the prediction of the movements of the stars must have followed as an extension of early statistical forecasting. still later on the statisticians told what the tides would do. long after these early beginnings, and indeed only after the development of the telegraph, came the statistical work of weather forecasting, but that again is no longer statistics. there is perhaps beginning with the war, and since then, all this has changed. only one field of recognized prophecy that statistics has retained as a specialized branch, and that is the prophecy of insurance. once more i would ask you to note that all prophecy that is not supernatural is statistical. note also that society is now demanding prophecy in such diverse and inexact fields as those of crop acreage, price movements, interest rates, school progress, building construction, industrial output, and most of all as to the course of general business. the advent of the new statistics has brought with it a great profusion of data, and also a wide extension of the demands on the statistician. before the war the chief demands were for straightforward numerical description, and for the analysis of past conditions. most of the results were stated in simple aggregates and averages. with the new statistics these more elementary tools are no longer adequate. the most obvious characteristic of the new statistics is that its methods are complicated, and its terminology made up of strange words. the statistician dealing with a distribution of observations, instead of a convenient total, uses the mean, or the median, or the mode to express some center of the group, and the standard deviation, or the probable error, or the semi inter quartile range to measure the scattering of the individuals from the center. by progressive steps he develops empirical equations to express relationships between variables, and plots regressions, or parabolas, or other graphic curves mathematically derived to represent the working out of these equations. this leads in turn to still more complicated methods of calculating relationships between variables by means of rectilinear or curvilinear correlation formulas. the use of such methods has brought into the new statistics a whole vocabulary of strange terms, a multiplication of mathematical symbols, and a varied collection of greek letters that are incomprehensible to the uninitiated, but a source of deep satisfaction to those of the inner cult. during the years before the war almost no papers appearing in the journal of the association employed elaborate mathematical terminology or symbols. in the past five years half of them by actual count have been of that sort, and in the past two years two thirds of them. the new statistical textbooks and treatises on method have undergone a corresponding change, so that it is now true of most of them that if you need to read them you cant, and if you can read them you dont need to. through this evolution a majority of the members of the profession have in this past decade been rendered statistically illiterate when confronted by the writings of their fellows. this new condition explains the bewildered difficulty of the firm that sought to employ a 4 statistical association t4 skilled statistician to illumine their problems. the dilemma of the new statistics lies between the recondite treatment of the difficult problems on the one hand, and the means of communicating the results intelligibly on the other, the first is whether or not these newer methods are essential or highly valuable in attacking the problems with which statisticians must now deal. i think the answer is yes. it is affirmative because all the fields of work in which statisticians are breaking new ground are fields in which no set or series of conditions is ever repeated. they are the fields of biology, psychology, education, sociology, economics, agriculture, and business research. if these were more nearly exact sciences we could proceed as do the fortunate students in many other fields who can repeat 2nd vary their experiments, while progressively controlling the conditions, and limiting accessory variations, until finally it becomes possible to draw truly general inferences. they have to do with living organisms, and for the most part with the behavior of human beings. because this is true the observations are scattered; relationships are at best only approximations; cause and effect are blurred. we cannot repeat experiments under identical conditions, or purposely varied ones, and because such control is unattainable we must employ the tools of statistical analysis through which we can replace the scattered distributions of the original observations by the mathematical expressions which will most truly represent them. after we have done this we can deal with these conventionalized mathematical substitutes so as to formulate the concomitance and relationships that exist between the associated series of evidence. the very end and aim of the new methods is this statistical formulation of observed relationships. it is seldom or never a seeking after laws, for in these humanistic studies of ours the observations do not yield results of such degree of universality that we may ennoble them by designation as laws of nature. they are expressions of natures infinite variety. we are seeking to measure trends. our work aims to discover the relative importance of different contributing influences. the final purpose is the statistical formulation of observed relation notable progress toward doing this has already been made in the more than a beginning has been made in only slight progress two major questions are at once suggested. our fields of work do not permit that. our figures deal with life. we try to identify controlling factors. ships. statistical study of biology. agriculture, in education, and in psychology. 51 the dilemma of the new statistics 5 has been made in doing it for economics, rather less than that in business research, and almost none at all in sociology. but much of the evidence in all these fields is numerical. we identify and discuss quantitative relationships in them. it seems clear that progress in extending the boundaries of our knowledge is dependent on the discovery of the generalized statistical relationships existing between such matters as supply and prices, prevailing interest rates and changing security values, prosperity and dependency, physiological maturity and school progress, advancing crop prices and acreage increases, and scores more of fundamentally important factors in our practical and theoretical problems. we may be confident that with rare exceptions we shall need the tools of the new statistics to formulate these relationships. we need their help to penetrate behind the deceptions of things as they seem, so as to see them as they are. i am not arguing that when we have these formulations of relationship we shall have advanced our sciences by the discovery of direct cases of cause and effect, for it is not probable that such advances are often made that way. i am arguing that if we can formulate generalities of relationship we may then, and not until then, have justifiable hopes of discovering the reasons for them. if we can state the relationships we can study them, test them, experiment with them, and perhaps ultimately explain them. it is in order to do this that we need the methods of the new statistics. the second question about the new statistics is whether or not it is essential that the statement of its processes should continue to be obscured by cryptic mathematical symbolism and abridged complexities of verbiage involving inferential leaps in the dark. i think the answer is no. the fact is that most of the mathematics called for by the greek letters and strange symbols of the new statistics is plain arithmetic with sometimes a little elementary algebra added. the proof that this is so is found in the fact that most of it is being computed daily by clerks who are accomplishing their tasks by using the mathematics they had acquired by the time they reached the eighth grade. there is now being conducted in washington a statistical training course in the methods of multiple curvilinear correlations, and no prerequisites of mathematical training beyond elementary arithmetic are demanded for admission. it is true that higher mathematics are needed for the derivation of some of the formulas in common use, and that in a larger proportion of cases they must be called upon for the demonstration of the validity of the formulas. but most statistical investigation does not require the development of new formulas, or the demonstration of the validity of old ones. if it did most of us would be hard put to it to justify our procedure when we divide one simple fraction by another by turning the second one upside down and multiplying. perhaps, too, our defense of long division would be no less difficult. probably the true reason why the recent writings of mathematical statisticians are such hard reading is that their writers wrote them for their fellow statisticians to read. they never intended that they should be intelligible to such persons as the presidents of their universities, the heads of their corporations, or the chiefs of their govern mental departments. the new statistics has been developed by rather lonely men who rightly coveted the respect of their professional fellows, but who cherished the satisfaction of belonging to a select group which had been initiated into the mysteries of a new and highly restricted fraternity. in some measures statistics has been afflicted by the snobbery of science in which each branch seeks to rise in the social scale by imitating the methods of the next more exact science. in our case we have been imitating mathematics which is not a science at all, but rather a specialized form of logic. it does not seek the truth, but only the exactitude of the deductive process. it is necessary for the mathematician doing new work to follow through the derivation of his process, and to demonstrate the validity of his method, but it is not often necessary for the statistician, because he is usually working in new material with old and tested methods. the dilemma of the new statistics has its origin in the fact that the workers of the new school with their elaborate equipment of technique have temporarily shifted the emphasis of statistical work from the purpose of the inquiry to the process by which it is conducted, from the stubborn facts to the subtle figures, from the material to the mathematics. the cart is before the horse, and the horse is running away. the first is addressed to all statistical workers whether they call themselves statisticians, economists, psychologists, sociologists, or bankers, or by some other name. it is that they overhaul their statistical equipment and make good its deficiencies. for most of them this will require that they familiarize themselves with modern methods of three kinds: first, those used in dealing with frequency distributions. second, those used in the analysis of time series, including the measurements of trends, and those of seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. for many of the mathematical statisticians the making good of deficiencies in technique will require that they learn the arts of which i have two pleas to make. third, measurements of relationship. the old governmental statistician is master; how to draw up a work manlike tabulation, how to write a good title for the table after it is made, how to draw an effective statistical diagram, and how to keep in mind the fundamentally important facts of population statistics which underlie almost all other statistics. i especially emphasize the plea that individual statistical workers should proceed forthwith to modernize their statistical equipment. i would go farther and term it an essential necessity, for the accumulating evidence clearly indicates that the statistician who fails to familiarize himself with the new statistics will within the next decade find himself unable to retain a position of importance in the profession. my second plea is addressed to all writers on statistical subjects, and it is that they set themselves to the task of mastering the art of expression characterized by lucid brevity. and i would point out that in my first plea i have done my best to help make a market for the literary output of the first competent mathematical statistician who will write a book explaining those methods of the new statistics that he can him self remember without looking them up, stating them in simple english, and without omitting any of the steps. for such an author fame and fortune are waiting, and an opportunity to turn his thoughts from an absorption that is selfish to a service that is social. such a book would be immediately, although perhaps secretly, purchased by every statistician, every economist, and every worker in business research. probably it would not be adopted by colleges, for the newest and best of the college textbooks have in their back pages glossaries of mathematical symbols covering upwards of 100 items. but this would not impair the sales, for every student would purchase the book as a trot, and use it to translate the assigned text. after all, statistics is essentially explaining, and the most competent statistician is the one who can most effectively interpret and explain the evidence that is hidden in the figures. two qualities he needs to cultivate. the other is that spare and vivid precision that everywhere characterizes thoroughbred expression, whether spoken or written. the value of statistics is directly and almost completely dependent on the quality of the presentation. the chemist, the physicist, the astronomer, the physiologist, and most other scientific men, have appeal to material facts to support the validity of their findings, and to demonstrate the degree of importance of their results. the statistician has only his explanation of what the figures mean. if he is a good explainer, he is a good statistician, and conversely. it will not do to protest that the president of the firm employing a one is the verifying habit of mind. skilled industrial chemist values his services highly even though he does not understand chemistry, and that by analogy it is unfair to ask of the statistician that he reveal so far as may be the processes that he has employed. the chemist develops a process which he claims will produce a desired result, and if it will, the result is his complete justification. the business statistician has no such direct appeal to facts. what he does is to interpret the meaning of figures relating to matters with which the employer has had long, intimate, and successful contact, and which he feels entirely competent to discuss. it is not surprising that he is disappointed when he finds that he cannot read what the statistician has written, or understand what he is talking about when he explains his findings. just now i am not particularly interested in it. my primary interest is in seeking the reestablishment of the lines of communication between two groups of statisticians, for these lines have broken down. in addition i am concerned about building up the means of communication between the makers of statistics and the users of them, for until statistics are available they are not valuable. in the past half dozen years there has spread through the english speaking world a notable movement that has for its object the humanizing of knowledge. it has found its expression in such books as outline of history, story of philosophy, outline of science, creative chemistry, and why we behave like human beings. these are not popular books in the formerly accepted use of that term, although it is to the great credit of the english speaking peoples that they have become best sellers. they are books which give evidence of the spread of the conviction in the minds of thoughtful men on both sides of the atlantic that the future of our civilization depends on the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind. these books are intellectual keys by which intelligent students can open doors that have hitherto been shut to them, partly because they could get no glimpse of the treasures behind them, and partly because the portals were barred by barricades of unnecessary technicalities. the possibility of humanizing knowledge has been demonstrated in physics, chemistry, history, philosophy, biology, anthropology. the time has come for a beginning to be made in the new statistics. i am not discussing the popularization of statistics.

1927,"22nd","Day, Edmund E.","Male","University of Michigan","Academia","89th","December 27–30, 1927","Washington, DC",NA,"The Role of Statistics in Business Forecasting",1927-12-28,"Edmund E. Day","1908-1939","in any large group of social scientists such as the one meeting here this evening widely divergent attitudes toward business forecasting are certain to be represented. at one extreme will be the view that business forecasting, though doubtless an unavoidable phase of the con duct of practical affairs, has as yet no scientific standing. according to this view, business forecasting when given scientific form is to be regarded as a sort of malpractice, not without its adherents and for the time being distinctly lucrative, but certainly not entitled to recognition by legitimate scientific practitioners. at the other extreme will be the opinion that in business forecasting is found one of the most valuable lines of endeavor in the entire field of social science a line in which realism, objectivity, and adequacy of treatment are compelled by the very nature of the problems encountered; a line in which weaknesses o€ procedure are most mercilessly exposed and high standards of performance most effectively enforced. in between these extreme views will lie attitudes ranging all the way from mild skepticism on the one hand to benign and hopeful interest on the other. clearly there is no consensus of opinion as to the place business forecasting should be assigned in the evolving program of social science. into this diversity of opinion at least one proposition may be profit ably projected: statistics and business forecasting have effected connections which are not likely to be speedily broken. it is unnecessary to determine here which one of the two made the first approaches; nor is it worthwhile to scrutinize the motives which led to the union. doubtless there are those who will regard the affair as a marriage of convenience, dictated by obvious pecuniary advantages; but that need not concern us at the present time. the important fact is that the attachment of business forecasting and statistics rests upon no passing fancy. the two are assuredly joined for life. the statistical clan, consequently, cannot afford to regard the situation with in difference. the family reputation is too clearly at stake. a conclave to give the entire matter thoughtful and sympathetic consideration would seem to be in order. the relation of statistics to business forecasting can best be analyzed if at the outset there is definite recognition of three general types of prediction: (1) prediction by analogy; (2) prediction by formula; (3) prediction by analysis. these three types rarely, if ever, appear in pure or unmixed examples. yet they represent such distinct differences in the logic of business forecasting that it is only in terms of each type in turn that the relation of statistics to forecasting is likely to be clarified. in the first of the three forms, prediction is effected through resort to the argument from analogy. it is reasoned that the present period is like a certain period in the past and that, therefore, the events lying just ahead will be like those which followed in the past period. of course, recognition of these similarities and dissimilarities of experience lies at the very foundation of all scientific inquiry. but in prediction by analogy the resemblances which are made the basis of prediction are of a general order. comparison does not take the form of detailed analysis. the forecast deals with the situation in the large. an illustration of this type of prediction is to be found in certain fore casts of the present post war price trend. ready reference has been made in these predictions to monetary experiences following certain earlier wars the napoleonic war in europe and the civil war in the united states are the two most commonly cited. it is argued that, inflation having attained certain heights and receded during certain periods in connection with these earlier occasions of armed conflict on a large scale, inflation may be expected to run about the same course in connection with the recent world war. in other words, the earlier post war experiences are lifted over bodily. time curves representing the price movement of the earlier period may be superimposed graphic ally on the later to give the prediction more concrete form. other examples of this type of forecasting could be readily supplied, but the type is too familiar to require further illustration. in forecasting of this sort the statistics that are employed merely serve to give the prediction more definite form; the underlying basis of the forecasting namely, the assumption that the two periods in question, insofar as the elements related to the point at issue are concerned, are essentially alike is not developed statistically. prediction by analogy makes connection with statistics, but its relation to statistics is superficial, not essential. prediction by analogy ordinarily falls of its own manifest superficiality. to observe that monetary inflation in connection with the civil war came to an end about thirteen years after the close of hostilities and to conclude from this that pre war prices will be restored in the united states in our own time, say in 1931, is to deal so exclusively with surface resemblances and so little with underlying differences as to discredit any conclusion before it is presented. in social investigation, argument from analogy has its place. at times it is highly suggestive. but it is never conclusive. business forecasting which proceeds entirely by analogy is not entitled to serious consideration. prediction by formula is a more interesting and significant type. the primary characteristic of the type is to be found in the discovery of specific critical factors, the condition and previous course of which determine events that are to ensue. a formula is developed to de scribe the behavior of the variable, or variables, in question. with this formula in hand, prediction becomes purely a mathematical process. this general type of forecasting may be most profitably examined in certain concrete varieties. one of the most interesting of these consists of the prediction of the future values of numerous aggregates such as city population, automobile registration, cigarette consumption through the application of a normal growth curve. here the future course of events is supposed to be forecast by the rate of change exhibited by the variable in its manifestations up to date. a curve having been fitted to the data on some formula which appears both to yield a reasonably close fit and to conform to certain notions of the underlying situation, prediction takes the form of simple extrapolation. a general law of growth, or of increase, is postulated. the procedure throughout is highly statistical. the prediction derives directly from a mathematical function. there can be no question regarding the value of this form of analysis in certain cases. when the variable of which future values are sought consists of a great aggregate of individual items the vast majority of which are practically certain to carry over, there is in the mass as a whole a stability or inertia which greatly facilitates the forecasting process. such statistical masses are not often subject to sudden radical changes of size. they move forward in deep channels which render highly unlikely any sharp diversions. variables of this character offer the most favorable opportunities for prediction by formula. in the first place there is not yet any convincing case for the exclusive use of certain grounds for caution nevertheless are to be noted. a single formula for the so called law of growth. true, any formula that is to be considered favorably must give expression to varying rates of increase during certain distinct stages in the characteristic development of observed mass phenomena. but a whole family of curves will meet this requirement. selection from among this family can hardly be made on the basis of closeness of fit, since inaccuracies of the empirical data are ordinarily of a higher order than are the failures of fit. at the present time one must conclude that there is no single formula for the law of growth. in other words there is still room for differences of competent opinion as to just what is meant by the law of growth. in the second place it must be recognized that prediction through the application of a curve of growth is attended by obvious uncertainty when the variable in question lacks inherent inertia. thus, present predictions of the demand for automobiles in the united states, based upon a growth curve fitted to the past demand for cars, may be quite upset by the general adoption of multiple car ownership. statistical masses of great magnitude are sometimes radically affected by new forces of an unforeseen and essentially unpredictable sort; statistical variables not presented in the form of continuing masses are obviously even more susceptible to sudden shifts: witness the many disruptions of trade occasioned by the great war, and the more recent unhappy sales experience of certain of the textile industries under the influence of changing styles. finally, it is to be noted that not infrequently in the fitting of curves of growth, or trend lines, future values are implied which challenge belief in the validity of the analysis for any considerable period ahead. in general, prediction through the use of a curve of growth is warranted to just the extent to which a thorough analysis of the factors underlying growth establish the reasonableness of the curve. for every mathematical formulation an adequate rational basis must be supplied. but in meeting this requirement, prediction by formula is almost certain to become prediction through analysis quite a different matter. another variety of prediction by formula is to be found in those forecasts which rest upon the notion of periodicity in the business cycle; or, upon what amounts practically to the same thing, the notion of constant duration in the several phases of the cycle. given the periodogram in the one case, or the standard period in the other, the problem of fore casting becomes a matter of locating certain basing points and of applying thereto the appropriate quantitative measure. it is only fair to say that there are few, if any, reputable statisticians who would recognize their own procedure in any such bald description. yet not a few business forecasts are the product of reasoning in which the idea of relatively fixed periodicity in one guise or another plays the leading part. increasing knowledge of the business cycle, however, is making the concept of fixed periodicity appear more and more unreal. duration of phases is itself one of the variables with which cycle analysis has to deal. no periodic function, however carefully derived, will solve the problem of business forecasting. still another variety of prediction by formula may be cited: namely the prediction that rests upon specified critical values, or turning points, of some particular element or ratio extracted from the general business situation. numerous examples of this sort of forecast could be readily cited. in appraising forecasts of this kind it is to be con ceded that, not infrequently, the variable which is made the basis of the forecast is highly significant. the weakness of the prediction lies not in the irrelevance of the citation but in its inadequacy. no single factor, however important, can be made the basis of scientific business forecasting. the ear mark of all prediction by formula is complete reliance upon previously devised quantitative measures of factors which are conceived to be definitely determinative of events to come. the underlying concepts are essentially mechanistic; the formulation is characteristically mathematical. laws are commonly postulated. specific elements are emphasized to the exclusion of all else. great reliance is frequently placed upon high coefficients of correlation without recognition of the fact that a coefficient of correlation may be so high as almost surely to indicate nominal relationship of the variables or manipulative treatment of the data. as might be expected, the results of prediction by formula have been unfortunate. few things have done more to dis credit statistics than the use of this sort of statistical procedure in business forecasting; few things more dangerous in forecasting than a statistician at large with a pet formula. prediction by analysis differs from prediction by formula not so much in its outward form as in its general philosophy. it makes extensive use of quantitative methods but does not exclude from consideration elements which at least for the present cannot be given quantitative expression. it throws into precise mathematical form as many of its analyses a h lend themselves to such treatment, but it does not regard the resultant mathematical formulations as anything more than serviceable symbolic expressions of the underlying concrete relationships. in the eyes of prediction by analysis the significance of a formula is to be found only in the presumptive reality and reasonableness of the relationship the formula sets forth. furthermore, for prediction by analysis, solution of the problem of business forecasting is to be found in continuous study of total business situations with reference particularly to the discovery of significant connections between variables. finally, prediction by analysis proceeds always with a minimum of pre conception and a maximum of scientific open mindedness. here are elements which cut clear through the relationship of statistics to business forecasting. a thorough understanding of what is meant by prediction by analysis presupposes a more general understanding of the nature of statistical methods and of statistical results. in this connection certain fundamental facts need to be clearly recognized. in the first place, a distinction must be made between description or perception, and inference. statistical method is par excellence a means of rendering description more accurate and illuminating. to the extent that the subject natter is complex in other words, to the extent that a multiplicity of forces join to bring about a given result statistical methods are in dispensable. the rapidly increasing knowledge of the business cycle which has been obtained in this country in recent years is the direct result of statistical inquiry. original data, registering movements of a composite sort, have been resolved into their simpler elements. trends, seasonal variations, cyclical fluctuations, irregular movements have all been brought clearly to light. the work has been highly significant. nevertheless it has been essentially descriptive in character. in recognizing the descriptive character of many statistical results, one should not conclude that the results derive entirely from the original observations. the statistician plays an important part even in descriptive statistics. for example, consider the task of constructing an index of the course of wholesale commodity prices in the united states since 1914. here the final figures are designed to be merely an accurate record of past events a descriptive account of important economic changes. but what the final figures are depends in very considerable measure upon what the statistician does upon the data he selects, the averaging methods he pursues, the weighting principles he adopts. there is no more common fallacy regarding statistics than this: that statistics can be safely divorced from the statistician. in statistical work, even of a descriptive sort, the acceptability of the results depends upon the credibility of the worker. a like statement is even more to the point when statistical work ceases to be primarily descriptive and becomes essentially analytical and rational. when correlation coefficients are computed, the statistician rarely confines himself as indeed he should not to a mere quantitative statement of here we deal with the processes of inference. the results. inferences are drawn as to the relationship of the variables. these inferences commonly represent a bold adventure into regions by no means commanded by the statistical artillery which has been brought to bear. frequently the statistical results are wholly consistent with any number of widely divergent inferences. true, the quantitative evidences, if carefully wrought, may make certain conclusions highly improbable if not altogether untenable. but statistical results have their limitations. to quote from: if we choose a group of social phenomena with no antecedent knowledge of the causation or absence of causation among them, then the calculation of correlation coefficients, total or partial, will not advance us a step toward evaluating the importance of the causes at work. inferences which by no means necessarily derive from the data form an integral part of most intricate statistical work. as a result, statistical analyses commonly expose the character of the statistician as definitely as they do that of the original statistical data. it should not be concluded from these statements that the contributions of statistics are to be regarded as of doubtful value. after all, there are competent, cautious, reputable statisticians. in the hands of these, statistical methods yield highly significant results. accurate description of phenomena, especially if they be phenomena presented in an intricate and complicated record of both relevant and irrelevant variables, constitutes an indispensable phase of scientific inquiry. great strides are to be made in all lines of social investigation through improved and extended analyses in which description and inference join forces under intelligent supervision. statistical analysis, even if its results be accepted always with reservations, has a most important contribution to make to social science. a further fundamental feature of statistical methods is to be noted. statistical results take form in a universe in which variation, approximation, contingency, and probability are prevailing conditions. lab oratory methods as applied in the physical sciences may reduce un controlled variations to negligible proportions; but in social situations, the isolation of factors is quite impossible. the partially known and the unknown unite to fix the record of social phenomena. as a rule, the social scientist is confronted with. situations into which material, economic, political, social, and psychological forces play with extraordinary complexity. were it not for the influences of custom, established order, habit, suggestion, inertia, and the like, the task of pre diction would present insurmountable difficulties. as it is, forecasts in the field of social science are always to be accepted subject to certain limitations. these limitations are imposed by a number of factors. first, many of the forecasts rest upon averages behind which wide variations in the individual items may be concealed. this fact of individual variation second, most forecasts involve the use of data which are mere approximations. the element of error is omnipresent. third, prediction in all social science is governed by contingency, not certainty, and the conclusions can only be stated as more or less probably correct. there will always remain a measure of art in business forecasting. breadth of general information and solidity of business judgment will always make their intangible but none the less important contributions. these factors set serious limitations upon business forecasting; they do not destroy its usefulness nor its scientific standing. with these ideas regarding the general nature of statistical methods and of statistical results clearly in mind, we may return to the consideration of prediction by analysis. that this type of prediction will make extensive use of statistics is obvious enough; only by resort to quantitative methods is prediction to be made at all scientific. statistical analysis focused on the time relationship of variables is certain to be especially valuable, exposing what may appear to be the "" prime mover"" in a given situation, or disclosing factors which may behave in such a fashion as to suggest joint causation or mutual interaction. studies of association and correlation in time are bound to constitute the backbone of statistical method as applied to business forecasting. along this line there is a task of major proportion, and one promising substantial results. but statistical analysis even of this more constructive sort is not all; that is necessary to scientific business forecasting. thoroughgoing theoretical analysis economic, political, sociological, social realistically conceived and constructively applied, must be joined with every important step in the statistical procedure. for too long the statistician and the theorist have gone their individual ways. they should become inseparable companions. if together they face the task of business forecasting as one worthy of their talents, as a task requiring continuous application and never failing caution, the relations of business forecasting and statistics need cause no concern. increasingly valuable results may be confidently awaited. meanwhile it may not be amiss to mention briefly in closing what appear to be the chief conditioning factors on the statistical side in the further progress of the work. in the first place, it is plainly evident that discoveries of new statistical technique are not just now a pressing need. no$ that improvements of technique are to be neglected; they are desirable at all times, of course. but the improvement of business forecasting does not now. is fundamental. await the development of more refined and precise instruments of statistical analysis. adequate apparatus is already at hand. progress depends upon its more effective employment. the importance of more comprehensive analysis, on the other hand, can hardly be exaggerated. we need to know more about consumers purchasing habits, family incomes, the accumulation of surplus funds, margins of profit, retail and wholesale stocks, price determining factors, interactions of credit, to mention only a few of the factors about which we now know all too little. in many instances the need is for additional original data. in other cases, existing data require more thorough analysis. a large number of relationships have yet to be subjected to statistical measurement. in general, business forecasting should be given a much broader and deeper statistical foundation than has thus far been provided. finally, there is every reason for accompanying statistical work in the field of business forecasting with a continuous appraisal of results, made generally available through publication of the findings. the failures are not necessarily discreditable ; in considerable part they are for the present unavoidable. why should they not be frankly acknowledged, and as fully as possible dispassionately explained? out of these mistakes of the past, valuable lessons for the future are to be learned. the difficulties in any course of free confession are to be acknowledged, of course. i can almost hear the words: what of the subscribers? what of the board? what of this vice president, or that? but if business forecasting is to achieve scientific status it must free itself of the restraints imposed by unenlightened commercial interests. this may sound like an impracticable counsel of perfection. nevertheless it is offered seriously. business forecasting should profit from the fact that its results are verifiable; it should be given constant evaluation in the light of subsequent events. only so is the work likely to go forward as it should with the greatest possible accumulation of knowledge and insight. reverting to the differences of attitude with which these remarks were introduced, one final conclusion may be ventured. the connections of business forecasting and statistics can no longer be fairly regarded either with intolerance or with indifference. there are in the possible contributions of statistical methods to business forecasting a significance and a promise that challenge the utmost that social science has to offer. let us as scientists accept this challenge; accept it seriously and with courage, but with a humility born of the manifest limitations of our methods and of the extraordinary complexity of the situations with which we have to deal.

the more regrettable, perhaps, because it has come, in our own time, to cover an otherwise alluring adventure into the numerical relationships of this mysterious and baffling world in which we dwell. though ours is to be ranked rather among the youngest of the sciences, it is in its nature one of the oldest; almost the archetype of all others. for clearly it was not until ancient man had begun"" to count, to measure, and to weigh,"" that any real science could be born; and these three processes are, in a sense, of the very essence of the statistical method. it is in keeping with this fundamental character of its investigations that this association should be the oldest of the scientific societies in this country of national scope older, i find, by nearly half a century than any other association represented at these annual gatherings. the statistical association has now maintained a continuous existence for a twelvemonth less than ninety years; no other has a lineage so ancient. yet it is only in our own time, and almost within the last decade, that statistical method has fairly reached the dignity of a true science; and only, as it were, under our own eyes that it is emerging from the Cinderella on the doorstep stage in which it remained so long. now, almost all of the fields of science feel the effects of its salutary discipline and the illumination of its analyses the later astronomy, biology, and especially the social sciences but it is in the domain of economics, perhaps, that the greatest promise lies. secure, even to some extent mummified, in its classical theories, it is largely in our own time that we have seen the beginnings of a quantitative analysis of the newer industrial activities of the world. not that the sordid problems of livelihood and sustenance, as they were once contemptuously thought of by the philosophers, have not always been the important part of the preoccupations of mankind. but so long as there was relatively little trade between tribes and nations, and, indeed, but little product above the immediate needs of sustenance, almost no banking, and no problems of currency and exchange, a true science of economics could scarcely arise. but with the immense development of mechanical appliances and the enormous increase of human powers which this has brought, and the parallel widening of human activities, the need of a new kind of knowledge of production, distribution, wealth, income, and employment became imperative. especially in this country, in the last hundred years, we have come, to our grief, to know the profound effects upon human happiness, and likewise upon economic progress, of the dislocations and disequilibria of these new activities, and notably the influence thereon of the varying supply of capital and credit. it would be alluring to review with you recent contributions to this field and to consider their effect upon economic theory. my theme tonight is narrower, perhaps more of social than of strictly economic import a problem that has deeply engaged our philosophy for more than half a century and to which i make bold to believe that the cinderella of the sciences may offer a solution. we may term it, if you like, the problem of prosperity. ii for this purpose may i focus attention upon the sixty or seventy years which have elapsed since the beginning of our great civil war; partly because our knowledge of this period is so much more definite than for any previous time; partly because the economic forces underlying our industrial development have in this period stood out in such vivid relief; partly because the beginning and the latter part were marked by gigantic wars, both in many ways the greatest till then in history, and embodying all the complicating elements characteristic of wars. one of the primal difficulties of all economic investigation is that the opportunity for endless repetition, with infinite variation, so characteristic of the physical sciences, is almost wholly lacking. rarely if ever is the experiment, the touchstone of modern knowledge, available. we deal with shifting sands of human events, and the sequence seems never quite the same. it is perhaps for this reason that in economic thought theory has so far predominated over quantitative research and the patient, difficult, and often disappointing working over of the available material. but if, in the epoch under view, we find two well marked periods profoundly disturbed by the dislocations of war demands and the devious devices of war finance, and, on the other hand, two periods in which these quondam abnormalities are lacking; and if then we find that the dominating forces and the sequence of events, the apparent causes and effects, were in each case essentially the same, we shall have at least some assurance that we are building upon a secure foundation. looking back over these sixty or seventy years we find distinct periods of what we may call marked prosperity and boom. the first of these, the era that followed our civil war, was characterized by the rapid expansion of our railway system and the completion of the first trans continental line; the opening up of wide areas of new and fertile land; another of the consequent ""land booms"" with which this country is so familiar; excited speculation; a violent rise in security and land values in brief, in the pioneering adventure which america has more or less represented almost from its beginnings. there was another striking characteristic a tendency to rising wages in contrast to declining commodity prices; in consequence, a widening disparity between workers' incomes and the cost of the commoner necessities of life, precisely such as we have witnessed since the close of the world war. it was not surprising, therefore, that, after the usual prattle as to the vast economic losses and exhaustions produced by the war, there should have arisen a numerous literature explaining all this and its attendant sequelae as ""the advent of a new era,"" a revolution in industry, and the like symptoms identical with the kindred literary effort which has become so familiar in our own time. there ensued, as you know, an unhappy disillusionment, perhaps the worst or the most widespread industrial depression which this country had known up to that time, when land values fell vertiginously, security prices as well, and grass sprouted between the cobblestones of wall street. we may gauge the extent of the disaster when we note that a wide list of gilt edged railway stocks, sold at the bottom of the panic of 1873, could have been repurchased in the still deeper depression of 1877 for one half the average selling price. this post civil war boom and collapse was, we know, repeated in an extraordinary degree in the twenty years that followed. the tremendous boom in the eighties ended in the panic of 1893 and, in the next four years, in a depression almost parallel to that of 1873 78. the renewed era of railway expansion of the eighties, involving the construction of ten or twelve thousand miles of railway within single years, with another of our prodigious land booms and town lot speculations, was followed by yet another period of seemingly utter prostration. disillusionment widened. the literature of the time took on another hue. the new thought then was that these booms and depressions were the direct product of our new industrial order, that there was something inherent and inevitable in their sequence. the likeness of time intervals, as between the panics of 1837 and 1857, of 1873 and 1893, and the intervening minor crises of 1843, 1847, 1877, 1884, and so on, was regarded as confirming this fatalistic view. almost every known variety of influence was invoked, sometimes singly, sometimes in convocation, to explain"" this disastrous malady. the first bureau of labor report, for the year of 1886, by carroll wright, listed 180 of these supposititious causes,"" for the most part as bizarre as they were futile. so imbued was the thought of the period with the idea of definite time intervals that in 1912 the russian, ventured to predict the advent of a similar disaster in 1914 16. but our own generation has seen no such recurrence of prolonged and grinding depression. we do not, of course, know that the outbreak of the world war did not forefend such a widespread stagnation as was seen in the nineties and the seventies. but it is clear that the last thirty years have seen a marked amelioration. the long battle over free silver and the final adoption of the gold standard by this country, the stage was set for another era of expansion, which came in the late nineties; and then, after a period of quiescence, came the war boom and its sequel, continuing to the present time. there was a sharp interruption from the banking and currency crisis in 1907, and again from the violent and world wide collapse of prices in 1921. but each of these was followed, in this country at least, by a quick recovery. it is not without interest that the phrase of ""hard times,"" so widely prevalent in economic writings for several generations, has almost disappeared from the vocabulary of our own. so the spell of the fateful time interval which had so deeply colored the economic thought of the nineties gave way to the benign optimism of the nineteen hundreds and to the reappearance of ""the new industrial era"" which had been the incantation of the eighties, and, before that, of the late sixties. the apprehensive may view with disquiet the perfervid iteration of this familiar hymn in the mushroom literature of the present time; and, unhappily, we cannot say that these are but the habitual reactions of the timid. it is still given to no man to construct the orbit of his own time. the future is still in large measure veiled; and we may find that some of the confident anticipations of today have the same value as the famous predictions of bankers and experts that, from 1900 on, interest rates would long continue at very low levels. yet, if i mistake not, a definite gain in knowledge has been made. from the conflagration of the world war, statistical inquiry received a profound impulsion. perhaps it required precisely such a vast economic upheaval to bring out the varied forces in clear relief. it is always the aberrations from the commonplace, the pathological side, as it were, which enable us to demarcate the forces which in their ordinary composition are so difficult to separate. in some sense one may say that the last fifteen years have provided the most fertile and fruitful, certainly the largest scale, laboratory experiment in economic theory that the human race has ever known. it is not merely that the theater was so vast, the scenes so varied, the relationships often so sharply contrasted; it was the advent in this field of a new method, the statistical method the careful recording of a vast number of numerical observations and the patient sifting and discussion of this wealth of new material. it is this, if i mistake not, which will differentiate economic investigation of the present from that of the past; that is, the replacement of theory and fantasy by the inductive methods of the physical sciences. it is not that the method is so new or its vogue as yet so wide. brilliantly begun by others over two generations ago, it had already, before the war, made notable advances at the hands of mitchell, moore and persons to mention only a few of the workers in this country. but compared with the rapid accumulations in recent years the material available to pre war workers was scant. it may be that a future time will say that it was with the remarkable outburst of statistical inquiry stimulated by and continued after the world war that economics as a science began. iv all this may be the part of over optimism. perhaps the same feeling has come to every period of highly quickened experience. be this as it may, i believe we have now reached, with at least tentative certitude, some conclusions on which the future may build. may i note certain of these which bear upon our present problem of the business cycle? 1. the evidence seems to be that the vast stream of directly consumable goods, that is, general trade, flows on with but little variation from year to year and decade to decade, save in its steadily swelling volume. to this stream of production and distribution of directly consumable physical goods we must add the vast body of non physical contributions to our daily comforts, enjoyments and interests made by the physician, the lawyer, the journalist, and all their kindred, and those more tenuous forms of entertainment provided by the actor and the dramatist, the clergyman, the educator, the philosopher, and other purveyors to our thirst for knowledge, fiction, or fantasy. this total body of direct consumability may make up, we may judge, something near 85 to 90 percent of the total of our industrial or economic effort. 2. the wide variables in our economic and industrial effort belong, broadly, to the field of construction and of more or less permanent improvement; the extension of plants; the construction of dwellings; the creation of new roads and new means for swift communication, as the motor car, the airplane, the telephone, the radio; all of which have become an integral part of our present day lives and a vital influence in our material, and perhaps also in our intellectual and philosophic, progress. but the sum total of all this is as yet relatively small, and we may evaluate it at perhaps not much more than 10 or, at most, 15 percent of the annual collective effort. it is in part the time interval elapsing between the initiation and the completion of these larger and more durable projects which gives to this element its greater variability. 3. largely it is the high variability of this latter element which has given rise to the belief that business as a whole fluctuates widely, and vogue to the phrase ""business cycles,"" or ""trade cycles,"" as contrasted with, let us say, the idea of construction or building cycles. the rather unsatisfactory data we have as to factory and some similar forms of employment and the perversion of these data into misleading estimates of unemployment have also contributed to this belief. the evidence seems to be that, save after times of financial panic and credit collapse, as. for example, in 1920 21, the variations outside of factory and constructional employment are comparatively narrow. 4. these latter periods of financial and industrial disturbance seem largely due to a state of imbalance which appears to arise from a disparity between the growth of the volume of trade and production, on the one hand, and the volume of credit on the other. i hesitate to add to this latter the volume or degree of savings, since this volume or degree seems as yet fraught with uncertitude. on the other hand, one might well add a second important factor, namely, the balance between constructional activity and the growth in population, wealth and income of the country. but here, again, measurement and, more especially, long term comparison seem difficult; and it is precisely this lack of adequate knowledge which at the present time makes evaluation of our economic situation so precarious. three of the four boom eras of which i have spoken followed directly upon a heavy accession of gold or some other basis for expansion and a corresponding increase in the credit volume, while the fourth came after the great inflation of the currency adopted as a means to carry on the civil war, when the whole credit structure of the country was on a paper money basis. in the same way, the end of three of these eras which are now a part of history came with a distinct credit shortage and a financial paralysis resulting therefrom, while the fate of the fourth is as yet undecided. there seems little doubt as to the general sequence of events, that is, first, the impetus to an unusual expansion of credit, followed by an unusual degree of constructional activity, which was carried on with only temporary interruptions as long as the credit supply was adequate. in each case this high industrial and constructional activity has been accompanied by a period of intense speculative activity which approached, at times, to a kind of national mania. it seems not improbable that this seizure of the national mind has been one of the chief contributing causes to the disasters and disillusionments which followed. in the earlier periods this speculative fervor related more distinctly to land booms and to the building of railways, which in many cases gave rise to the booms. with the disappearance of great areas of unoccupied land and the diffusion of population over all of the habitable areas of the country, these great land booms, once so picturesque a part of our developmental history, have largely disappeared. they have given place to the eras of widespread industrial consolidation and excited speculation in the shares of these great corporate organizations. v is history indefinitely to repeat itself? how far may this general sequence of events guide us as to what is to come? does the economic history of the last sixty or eighty years really afford us a clue? many have taught, and we are accustomed to think, that our panics and industrial crises extend far back; but this seems in part an illusion. the evidence appears to be that the panics of 1837 and 1857, and others preceding them, were not followed by years of grinding depression as were the crises of 1873 and 1893. our industrial and financial organization had not in the earlier periods reached that degree of complex development which for a time seemed to make it so vulnerable to disturbances, both internal and external. in colonial days, and even into the earlier period of the republic, the larger part of human needs and desires, the comforts and necessities of life, were the product of the immediate locale in which they were consumed. the average citizen was largely the taker of his own product. in the days of washington and jefferson the total volume of trade, while not negligible, was at least extremely small, if for no other reason than that means of transport of goods, save by water, were almost non existent. it was distinctly with the unparalleled expansion of the means and speed of transport that the modern trade of the world, and therewith trade cycles and business cycles, took on a vital social import. today we may plot the curve of intensity of the business cycle and say that it began to show some rise with the advent of canals and turnpikes in the twenties and thirties; that it began to ascend rapidly in the forties and fifties with the prodigious burst of railway construction, and perhaps to reach its peak of intensity in the seventies, eighties and nineties, when the present geographical and industrial relationships of the nation were largely completed. since then there has been a marked decline. it is a matter of regret, for the study of economic affairs and especially of business cycles, that the world war should have come just when it did. we were deeply in need of yet another crucial test for the confirmation or modification of our theories. it is to be recalled that even as late as 1907 we had a sharp panic, markedly similar in many ways to that of 1884, and as brief and transient in its dislocations. what might have happened, then, after 1914, had there been no war? the rapid increase in gold production seemed near an end. the world was coming to an almost universal use of gold as a monetary and credit standard. the absorption seemed nearly equal to the supply. in the four years preceding 1914 even so mercurial a measure of prices as the index of commodities at wholesale, so sensitive to every variety of disturbance, was almost at a standstill. there was then no threatening overexpansion of credit; this was because of the immobile state of the price barometer. there was no prodigious wave of railway building as in the eighties, or of huge constructional activity such as we have seen in the last seven years. there was deep commotion at the ominous rise in the urban cost of living and the usual deluge of commissions of inquiry into what was perfectly obvious and well known. but otherwise the industrial state seemed oscillating like a damped pendulum. would it have so continued? we do not know. but for this country, at least, the procedure of events after 1914 was still along strictly classical lines an overwhelming inflow of gold and a consequent expansion of bank credit unequaled since our civil war exactly the same violent rise in prices to, curiously enough, almost exactly the same degree j followed after the close of the war by a burst of constructional activity and culminating in what appears to be, perceptually, the greatest wave of stock speculation which the country has known. happily for the student of the economic spectacle there came with all this a parallel outburst of the statistical mania which has come, in the eyes of the foreigner, to be an outstanding trait of the character. and this has given us a marvelous fund of information. thanks to this, we may at least say a number of things, and perhaps, also, dispose of some idle ideas which have been widely prevalent. we can see now that, despite the universal impression, the war did not make us rich; nor did gold and inflation make us rich. neither did they make us poor. they seemed to have singularly little effect upon the nation as a whole only upon individuals and classes of society. if we plot a curve of our industrial growth, of our gain in total product and manufacture, covering the last fifty or eighty years, and if, removing dates, we chop this up into equal pieces. as in a child's game, we find it difficult to pick out the war period. we find that it differed in no wise from other periods of marked expansion. we now know that we have made no unparalleled gain in efficiency, either during the war or since. the impression of increased efficiency seems the illusion of every period of marked industrial expansion, and directly the product of our incorrigible thirst for bunk. the rate of our industrial growth, the gain from one decade to the next, seems not materially to have changed within the last sixty or eighty years. so far as the evidence is attainable, this rate of growth seems not to have varied widely from a long term steady average of about 4 percent per annum. in periods of boom it is a little higher; in the ensuing depression, a little less. we have been steadily growing richer and more efficient for at least a full century, and, taken over the larger intervals, at apparently an almost unchanging rate. it is obvious that with the steadily declining rate of increase in population this unchanging gain in total product has meant more and more from, and for, the individual, and must mean a steady rise in our comforts and enjoyments. we have had a huge increase in our gold stock or, as i feel we may now begin to think of it, our gold hoard. but it has not been incomparable. we had an almost similar accession after we resolved definitely for the gold standard in 1896 and again, in the earlier period, when we determined upon the resumption of specie payments; perhaps, also, in the fifties, following the romantic discoveries in california and australia. from 1850 to 1861 our gold stock increased tremendously, from an almost negligible figure to 270 millions in 1861; from 1877 to 1888 it increased from 168 millions to over 700 millions, a gain of about 320 percent; from 1896 to 1906, from 600 millions to nearly 1,500 millions, a gain of 150 percent; and from 1914 to 1924, from around 1,900 millions to 4,500 millions, a gain of about 135 percent. on these increases, in each instance, was posited a correspondingly heavy increase in the volume of bank credit; and with this, in each instance, a rapid and unusual gain in industrial and constructional activity. undoubtedly this sharp increase in industrial product was owing in part to the slack obtaining in the antecedent periods of depression and in part to the potent influence of the revival of construction. also, in each of the three latest instances, namely, the late seventies, the late nineties, and again during and just after the war, there was a heavy gain in our nominal balance of foreign trade. this inevitably implied a nation that had been relatively importing less and exporting more, which in part also implied a nation that was spending less and saving more. but there seems little reason to question the dominant influence of the sharply augmented purchasing power due tothe heavy accessions of gold and the new bank credit erected upon these accessions. thus was the stage set for the boom periods which followed and, with the booms, the revival of frenzied speculation. vi perhaps the greatest of economic riddles is why this accelerated tempo of industrial and constructional activity cannot be indefinitely maintained. but the larger aspects, at least, seem clear. we now know that there is a fairly fixed normal or usual rate of industrial expansion, depending upon the growth of population, invention, discovery, and improvement of methods of production. superimposed upon this rate, from time to time, is the added impulse derived from more intense building activity, which feeds its own flame. there is, always, a maximum amount of employment for any given period, and in proportion as the boom grows, therefore, there is a tendency to higher wages and greater spending power from all that part of the community directly affected. following this is a demand for better housing, better shops, better transport facilities, and the like. our scale of living seems distinctly to rise. and from this fact the feeling of well being associated with periods of prosperity seems very largely derived. this feeling is highly stimulated by the speculative rise in lands and urban property and, latterly, more especially in the share values of our great industrial enterprises. the large gain in the actual possessions of a great number of individuals gives rise to the illusion of a real and an unusual gain in national wealth and income. but back of every such era apparently the most important factor always is the increased spending power derived from the expansion of the circulating medium, which, i need not say, in our own time is almost wholly a question of the expansion of bank deposits. this seems the primal condition for all booms. this is, if not the vis primus, at least the enacting clause of all undue expansion. i repeat here my favorite simile of the tethered cow. it may browse with freedom within the range of its rope, but expansion beyond this point is clearly conditioned by a lengthened tether. but this expansion has definite limits in its effects. perhaps the largest gain in our knowledge of credit phenomena, in recent years, has been the adequate proof of the relative inelasticity of business and trade in relation to the credit volume; that is, that unduly rapid expansion of credit and purchasing power can lead to only a very moderate increase in total production. when we reach the practical maximum of employment, it is obvious that further expansion of purchasing power can only lead, for the time being, to enhanced prices for the existing product or, as at the present, for land and securities. this fact is elementary, but is often lost from view. on the other hand, in all boom periods, save that of the present, the amount of possible credit expansion has also soon reached the end of its tether. periods of boom do not usually imply decreased imports and increased exports, that is to say, an augmented balance of foreign trade, but, as a rule, precisely the reverse. and as our actual international balance seems never to be very large, and as it is highly sensitive to the balance of spending and saving, the result has usually been an outflow of gold or its equivalent, or at least an inadequate inflow, with the usual recurrence of a credit stringency. this has meant a sharp check, if not to the broad stream of trade, at least to speculation and to those constructional activities which, as i have endeavored to make clear, are the main propellant forces making for what we call boom. if, now, we gather together the threads of the argument, what conclusion may we reach? we have seen that, historically, every period of unusual expansion or boom has been followed by a corresponding depression, and that the resulting rate of growth of our wealth and of our product in the whole period has been no greater than the average in more peaceful or normal times, when the boom spirit is absent. in other words, these boom periods, which we have come distinctly to associate with the idea of national prosperity, seem to represent in the end no clear national gain. why, then, should we have them? years of unusual expansion are paid for by lean years of depression and unemployment, often involving widespread suffering. high hopes are brought low, fortunes are wrecked, and, worst ·of all, the business and economic morale of the nation seriously impaired. when fortunes can be made gambling in pieces of paper, of what utility or attraction are the antique virtues of industry, sobriety and thrift? these are temporarily thrown into the discard, reluctantly and discontentedly to be resumed when the house of cards has crumbled. but, it may be urged, are these pleasant periods of excitement and exaltation to be done away with deliberately? does anyone seriously propose to check prosperity when it comes? are not such waves of over optimism characteristically a part of our exuberant temperament? is it not precisely this exuberance, and the restless, aggressive spirit which goes with it, which has given to these united states today the industrial and perhaps now also the financial primacy of the world? in brief, shall there be no more cakes and ale? the answer seems to be that the apparent gains of prosperity, or at least of boom, are largely illusory, and in so far as they are a reality have been, in the past at least, too dearly paid for. clearly, true prosperity, that is, the general diffusion of comfort and well being among the largest possible number of the population, is not dependent upon inflation and boom. clearly, we do not need a debasement of the currency of exchange or a frenzied commotion of speculation in stocks to assure this condition of well being. we have this amply at other times without the attachments of a champagne jag. moreover, there is always a considerable body of our population that barely lives within its income; prudence, economy, and self denial are not universal virtues, and in great numbers of cases even these are of little avail against misfortune and deficient ability. in periods of reversal and industrial depression this part of the population pays heavily for the over confidence or reckless optimism, the high play of our captains of industry and finance. is the game worth its price? there is yet another side. there is evidence that these periods of boom and heavy gambling represent a distinct transfer of wealth and income from the many to the few, from the ignorant and imprudent to the pockets of the sagacious, the farsighted and the crafty. always in such periods there is a vast number of wildcat flotations which bring incredible losses to the unwary. the evidence seems to be that in these periods of speculation the number of incomes above, say, $50,000 rises with great rapidity, and the increase in these incomes runs far beyond the gain in the aggregate income of the country. the income tax returns now reveal between thirty and forty thousand individuals with incomes equivalent to or exceeding that of a millionaire. possibly half or more of these incomes have been created by the violent debasement in the value of the currency which has taken place since the beginning of the war. only seven thousand individuals were so rated in 1914. a considerable part of the present number must be due, also, to the enormous rise in the value of securities since the war and to the colossal manipulation in security values, incomparably the greatest gamble the world has ever known. is the millionaire, per se, so desirable a type that our economic machinery should be geared thus to create them by the tens of thousands? are we as a people happier, more contented, saner in spirit, less lost in the maelstrom of making money, because we may boast of twenty five thousand new millionaires in the last decade? more than eighty years ago the greatest of our philosophers wrote of great, intelligent, sensual, avaricious america. must it ever so remain as emerson felt it then? the cynical may indeed suggest that this concentration of wealth and income, this filching from the many to enrich the few, is an agreeable means of expanding that fund of capital which is so necessary for our industrial growth; and that the greater the degree of concentration, the greater the eventual gain in national wealth. but on this plea we should be led to suggest, for example, that governmental lotteries are the most economical and least painful form of taxation. nothing so highly stimulates thrift and self denial among the masses as the chance for fabulous gain which the lottery brings. the moralist might add that the human ape is largely spurred on to greater efforts by the illusive phantoms of hope and imagination, and that the greater rein we give to these qualities the greater the general enjoyment and content. but the puritan spirit which still dominates our national polity has suppressed the lottery, as it attempts, also, to suppress so many other of the pleasures of the flesh, the wine cup and the bay leaf. will it leave untouched what still remains our chief form of emotional intoxication and self illusion? these are problems which we must leave, perforce, to the spirit which rules us, in the mournful assurance that nothing which the economist may offer will influence it in any way. but if we may not change the spirit, and still less attempt to regulate the movement of our vast industrial machine, can we do nothing at all? one thing of profound importance i think we may do. we have seen how closely our industrial expansion is bound up with the supply of capital and credit. in this capital supply, beyond question the high variable is bank credit. other immediate sources of capital represent largely a conversion of funds from this primary source. what we term saving and thrift seem very largely constant forces. they rise with credit expansion and decline with its contraction. in the long run, of course, the amount of real saving may represent a nearly constant relationship to the real income and real product of the country. for the time being, at least, it is clearly augmented by inflation and depressed by deflation. if, then, the augmentation of the credit supply is the vital factor, we have here what may well be an object of the most general concern, especially if, as seems true, this is' in large measure subject to rational control. we have learned to measure the rate of our industrial growth. we may, likewise, measure the rate of credit expansion from year to year, and even month to month. between the two exists the definite balance of which i have spoken. the evidence now seems clear that an excess of the rate of credit expansion over the growth of production and trade results merely in the familiar forms of over stimulation, inflation and speculation. if the rate of credit expansion falls below that of the normal gain in product, the result appears to be a crimping and contracting influence, bringing with it unemployment and a check to the normal growth. the proof of this narrow relationship, this sensitive balance, seems to me the most important contribution which statistical investigation has made to economic theory, and its recognition as a working rule of banking and credit policy may prove the greatest gain which we have derived from our now centralized and unified banking system.",258,24.1395348837209,4.75433526011561,0.250160565189467,6228,1558,17.3012329912921,12.3012329912921,23,0.825561442990903,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1929.10502505"

Wilson","1908-1939","it is, i believe, the custom for the president, avoiding technicalities in his address, to give the association some general point of view upon that particular branch of theoretical or applied statistics upon which he may consider himself reasonably competent to advise. it has seemed to me well to discuss the relation of mathematics to statistics, partly because so many persons behave as though a great deal of mathematical background were essential to a safe and satisfactory practice of statistics and partly because so many others behave in the directly contrary way as though no mathematics at all were necessary and much were harmful. in treating a topic on which behavior is so varied and opinions presumably even more at variance, it must be apparent that i am taking my life in my hands and that if i survive at all it can only be with fewer friends and more enemies. by this i mean that when you add 2 and 5 together you may get 7, which is right, or something else such as 3, which is wrong. or, to take a more complicated illustration, if you decide to fit some empirical formula or curve to a set of coordinate data, such as prices and times or populations and times, you may proceed in several ways. first, you may plot the variables and draw in the curve according to your aesthetic sense. a curve so fitted cannot be either right or wrong, but only a matter of taste. there is no way in which the work can be checked. of course a dozen persons may be given the same sequence of points and be required each to fit the curve according to his taste; the results of those different fittings may then be compared to determine how much and in what way the solutions differ. i am not averse to this aesthetic procedure. when the curve to be fitted is a straight line, it has been found by experiment that the solutions obtained do not, on the average, depart from the least squares solution by more than two or three times the probable error of the least squares solution, provided the drawing be made on an adequate scale. in cases where it is not important to check the work and where the precise least squares solution is unnecessary, the graphical method is often the best because the easiest to follow. there are persons, however, who like to go through the work or force their assistants through the work of a least squares solution even when it is not necessary. and of course there are many cases in which to avoid the work of a least squares solution would be to shirk. one great advantage of such a solution is that it can be checked, it is either right or wrong. every person who does the work correctly, starting with the same set of data, with the same weights assigned to each point, and with the same empirical formula to fit, should get the same answer to that degree of arithmetic accuracy which is justified by the number of places carried in the calculation and without any regard to whether the original data justify carrying so many arithmetic places or not. it is a matter of taste whether one deter mines to apply least squares; it is also a matter of taste whether he assigns one set of weights or another to the various points, and it is often a matter of taste whether he selects one or another type of empirical formula to be fitted; but once this is all determined, the answer is right or wrong just as is right and is wrong or better, as is right (to four places) and is wrong (even to two places). although mathematics may be right or wrong, i believe it is fair to claim that it should be right. it is difficult to undertake to prove that mathematics should be right. we are here dealing with a question of ethics, not with one of science. we do not expect an artist to be right or wrong; we could hardly accuse a metaphysician of being either right or wrong. the criteria of excellence of performance in all such cases must be based on tastes the tastes of the performers and of their critics, and, according to the old maxim, albeit i know of nothing about which there is so much dispute as tastes, and for obvious reasons, which may account for the necessity of the maxim. the reason that mathematics should be right is because it can be; and for this reason, to avoid disputes, it has become the professional ethics of those who apply mathematics to get that part of their work right. so wide spread is this ethics that in practice one rarely tries to check the purely mathematical work of an investigator. it is not that the principle of corroboration which pertains to all scientific investigation is in abeyance, but merely that the mathematician is expected to check, i. e., to corroborate his own work so that the reader may take it on faith. let us borrow the terminology of our sociologists and say that it is in the folkways and mores of mathematicians that their mathematics should be right. precisely because there are so many persons now using mathematics for the first generation in their respective sciences that it is advisable to set out what is the professional ethics of applied mathematicians. and because i regret to say that i have come across work by well known investigators, in famous institutions, financed by generous foundations, work printed in journals of international repute, but unhappily so far from right that its wrongness can be recognized at a glance by anyone really familiar with mathematical procedures. evidently the work could not have been checked by the authors as it should have been or really read by an intelligent editor. this kind of writing and editing is a real imposition on the reader and necessitates some emphasis upon the duty of him who uses mathematics to get it right. of course, we must not be too severe, accidents will happen and in any particular case it comes down to a matter of judgment as to whether negligence has been criminal. mathematics, assumed now to be right, may be appropriate or inappropriate to the problem in hand. this appropriateness is again very largely a matter of taste. one great advantage to the investigator of being familiar with a considerable variety of techniques and of the mathematical background of those techniques is that he has a greater experience and a sounder knowledge as a basis for his judgment as to appropriateness and is therefore likely to have better taste in such matters. i wonder how many of you realize how pervasively that method penetrates our statistical procedures even when it does not appear on the surface. suppose we add a column of figures and find the mean. do we stop to think that the mean is the least squares solution of the problem of finding one item to represent the whole group? the mean is nearest to all the elements of the group only if we take as the criterion of nearness the square of the eccentric departure and not the departure itself. it is the median which we should use if our notion of nearness is to be founded on the departure instead of on its square, and i may recall to your mind that the great economist and statistician edgeworth, had a considerable partiality for medians let us treat it as an axiom. why, then, should i make so much of the matter? i made mention of the method of least squares. i know not why, perhaps merely as a matter of personal taste. fortunately for many if not most problems, conclusions based on working with medians or with means are for practical purposes identical, but when they differ one may well hesitate. to discuss a little this question of appropriateness of mathematics, let us take the purely hypothetical question: where should our association meet? how might a scientific member from among us solve this problem? as to this i have no idea, the ways of scientists are often inscrutable. one type of mind would doubtless construct a spot map of our membership scattered as it is about the country. if very conscientious, he would recall that many who are not our members but belong in associations which use statistics should perhaps be given some consideration, and he might therefore add to his spot map with somewhat reduced weights points to represent them. but how then select our meeting place? should he determine the center of gravity of all these points? some would do so automatically. they would be in fact maintaining that the best point to meet would be that which minimized the sum of the squares of the railroad fares that would be paid by all persons if all attended. and others might reason that what we needed was the point of greatest concentration of our population on the ground that it would be of maximum convenience to the greatest number a just procedure provided not many would come from a distance anyhow. this would be selecting the mode. still others might feel that all interests were best met by that point which would make the sum of, the railroad fares least, being in that median sense the point nearest to the whole membership and thus presumably most convenient on the whole. it is clear that the scientific solution could be obtained only after determining that type of mathematical formulation which was most appropriate to the problem, and this determination would be a matter of taste. fortunately, we all know that we may be spared such a scientific determination of the place where we shall meet. like as not, nobody would be satisfied with the solution anyway and at all events there would be years of dispute over the appropriateness of any method ology. much more practical means suffice. the economic association determines willy nilly to come to washington; the political scientists feel an irresistible urge to celebrate their 25th anniversary at new orleans, and the rest of us decide where we will go only after much discussion and perchance with small rational basis. this is one of those cases where pretty much all mathematics is inappropriate, where any mathematics whatsoever will give an entirely false sense 01 precision to a problem in which no precision inheres. and there are many problems in economics or sociology or the public health which are as yet very much in the same position and where we need not so much some kind of mathematics or some particular statistical technique as a general survey of a wide range of facts, many of them qualitative rather than quantitative, which may serve as a basis for some decision. probably the majority of problems to which the statistician must turn his attention are in reality somewhat intermediate between those in which the technique to be applied is clear and those in which no technique, at least of a mathematical sort, is advisable. in this methodological no mans land, the statistician must do the best he can. he may have to develop a new technique; in that case he has two chief reliances, first and foremost a sound and wide acquaintance with the field of activity in which he has to operate, and second a good mathematical background, because it is from that that all techniques are developed; but if choice must be made between familiarity with his subject and familiarity with mathematics, i should unhesitatingly prefer the former. mathematics is a queer horse and all too easily runs away with its rider; and then there is such a satisfaction in trying its various gaits in all sorts of roads that many a rider has gone off in almost the opposite direction from the path he should have followed in his pursuit of the solution to some scientific problem; he may have ridden right over his solution to some purely fantastic goal. each person has to do the best he can to bring to bear upon his work the talents and the training that he has. if i may be pardoned a personal confession, i will say that i have never been sorry that in my youth i acquired an unusually good acquaintance with mathematics. at times when engaged upon some statistical problem in physics, i have needed to learn new mathematics, but for the most part my early training has sufficed not only to let me follow the mathematics of others but, so to speak, to see through it with an assurance which sometimes has convinced me that it was hollow. and if in my present studies i use but little of the vast amount i have once learned, it is not because i do not like the exercise of using it but because i prefer tools more appropriate to my job even though not so refined one gets ahead faster. mathematics may be right or wrong, it may be appropriate or inappropriate, it may be useful or useless. there is many a useless problem. sometimes one cannot see it is useless until much time has been spent upon it. but consider this: i have a field in new hampshire much covered with stones, rocks, and boulders. with sufficient energy i could weigh all those objects, divide the weights into suitable intervals, plot a histogram, and fit a frequency function. that would be scientific observation, followed by mathematical treatment of the observations. the problem is obviously statistical. it would keep me occupied for some time. but what would be the use? of course if i knew enough about geology to be confident that my field was a fair sample of a large group of fields and if there was any geological or agricultural or constructional or other interest to be served in determining a frequency function of the weight of superficial stones from small to large from a sample field the job might not be useless but useful. but there seems at present no good purpose to be served by its doing. and often i wonder in some of my reading whether the hard work the author has done, though correct and appropriate in its mathematics, may not be quite useless. what we need to foster is useful, appropriate, correct mathematics applied to worth while scientific problems, and worth while scientific problems whether or not they have reached the stage where any considerable use of mathematics is helpful. and in these vital matters, we have far more need of good taste and a sure instinct than is commonly believed; for it is so often only in the future that we can get a statistical estimate of the worth whileness of present activities. happy is the statistical investigator who can use all his techniques with discretion, and happy the teacher who can give his students some sense of proportion as well as a group of methods in such a conglomerate field as statistics. placed as i was upon the program between sociology and economics, represented by such giants as presidents ogburn and gay, interested the one in making himself a mental centrifuge to precipitate the facts of recent social change from that murky colloidal solution we call the present, the other bent on crystallizing out from the sub cooled liquor of our past the solid course of prices, it was quite impossible for me to determine whether i was to be the meat of your sandwich or the comic relief of your tragedy. without pausing now to suggest an answer to this question, but rather in the continuing line of my previous remarks, may i direct your attention to that interesting statistical treatise the bridge of xan luis rey, by thornton wilder. some of you recall the story. the bridge fell, killing five persons, and the devout brother juniper was struck by the question: why did this happen to those five? and determined to surprise the reason of their taking off. it seemed to him that it was high time for theology to take its place among the exact sciences and he had long intended putting it there. what he had lacked was an opportunity for observation under proper control. previous happenings had been involved, but here was a sheer act of god and at last his intentions could be studied in a pure state. it was not, however, brother junipers first essay in scientifically examining the ways of god to man. there had been a deadly pestilence of small pox in his village and he had recently drawn up a diagram of the characteristics of fifteen victims and fifteen survivors, the statistics of their value sub specie. each soul was rated upon a basis of ten as regards its goodness, its piety and its usefulness to its family group. the investigation developed difficulties; almost every soul in this little community turned out to be economically indispensable and the column headed usefulness was all but useless; negative signs had to be introduced to distinguish from the good and bad those who were not only wholly bad (grade 0) in and of themselves but actively led others into wickedness. from all this data the good scientific friar contrived an index for each person. he added up the total for the victims and compared it with the total for survivors to discover that the dead were five times more worth saving. and then, taking a walk by the pacific he tore up his findings and cast them into the ocean a most profitable mode of publication and in a medium of the widest circulation. so when he came to study his one great chance, the collapse of the bridge with its five victims, having experienced the bitter disappointments of statistical procedure, brother juniper forsook the method of. in compiling his book on these five victims he omitted no slightest detail for fear he might lose some guiding hint. he put everything down in the hope that the countless facts would suddenly start to move, to assemble, and to betray their secret. of one, the marquesa de montemayor, he learned from her cook that she had lived almost entirely on rice, fish, and a little fruit, and he put it down on the chance that it would some day reveal a spiritual trait to aid in sifting the inscrutable ways of god. from another, he learned that she came unbidden to his receptions to steal the spoons. a bookseller testified that she was one of the three most cultivated persons in town. the midwife declared that she had called upon her with morbid questions until she became a nuisance; a servant that though absent minded she was compact of goodness. and so with many another in her respect and in that of the other four. we may pass over the conclusions to state that the book being finished was pronounced heretical and our scientific theologist brother juniper was burned alive with it apparently to the great regret of everybody, but the simple persons of his time may not have had our overburdening experience with questionnairing. with an apology to you and to mr. wilder for these few free quotations from the bridge of san luis rey, couched in a crude english that does him no justice, 1 will leave you with the suggestion that you study further this remarkable statistical romance and i will venture the hope that should the author make a few dollars extra from royalties because of this hint of mine, he should apply them to securing a membership in our association. some of us need him in our business.

in attempting to answer this question, i naturally turn to my own personal experience. not many years ago i found myself associated with a small group of very practical statisticians, who were called upon to effect a rapid and considerable expansion of their activities. the immediate problem was that of selecting and hiring a properly qualified staff. it was urgently necessary to answer the question, what is a statistician? we started in the orthodox manner by calling in a variety of candidates for the new positions and by examining them in the usual way as to education and past experience. but our experience with the first few candidates was unpromising. they might be well trained in theory, they might be experienced in the mechanics of statistics, but the divine f i e seemed to be lacking. the period in question was that immediately following the great war, when much interest still existed in the intelligence ratings that had been developed for military purposes. we, therefore, decided to begin our examination of candidates by submitting them to the army intelligence tests. and here we obtained at least a beginning of the solution of our problem, for we discovered the very interesting fact that no candidate who failed to pass these tests, with a rating well up in that range necessary for officers rank, could by any possibility become a real statistician. but this was only the first small step in our task, for even those candidates who passed the military tests with high ratings were only in small fraction qualified to become statisticians. so we set ourselves next to the preparation of a super examination, that should separate the statistical wheat from the chaff in the group that had survived the initial test and in this we were finally successful to such an extent that we discovered an almost absolute correlation between the rank of a candidate in the super examination and his subsequent practical value to us as a statistical performer. yet, in the working out of super examination, the most interesting feature was not so much its practical usefulness as the entirely new picture that developed in answer to the question, what is a statistician? as the examination gradually took shape and became more effective for its purposes, it became less statistical in form and was more and more concerned with tests of the logical faculties. one of our original questions was as to the general time of day in which the full moon rose, and why. but, unfortunately, this simple inquiry floored nine out of ten of the college professors. so we had to substitute an easier problem, which, i believe, originated with herbert spencer. the candidate was told to assume that married men as a class lived longer than single men, while at the same time the act of marrying shortened each individual mans life. he was then asked to reconcile the two assumptions and it is needless to say that he got a zero rating if he gave us the classical answer that married life only seemed to be longer. in the final development of our examination, it became composed entirely of non technical questions similar to the preceding. we began, then, to search for new methods of selection. discovered, in fact, that it was of small importance whether a candidate could, or could not, work out a coefficient of correlation, provided he knew instinctively when to distrust one. and in the end we found ourselves placing technically trained statisticians, mathematicians, and actuaries under the supervision of skilled logician f men who might have to learn the details of statistical technique, but who started with an instinctive knowledge of the scientific method as a whole. this, then, was our pragmatic answer to the question, ""what is a statistician? "" the statistician must be instinctively and primarily a logician and a scientist in the broader sense, and only secondarily a user of the specialized statistical techniques. the statistician who knew only statistics was a danger and a blight. it was less important to know how to use statistics, than it was to know how and when not to use them. but this was not the only lesson we learned from this special experience. we were constantly being requested to advise regarding the organization of statistical departments, and in many cases were asked to make specific recommendations as to the appointment of statisticians by business and industrial organizations. the latter requests were particularly difficult to handle. we found that we could rarely advise in good faith the appointment of even the best trained statistician who was unfamiliar with the business that he was to analyze. and we finally found ourselves making two distinct types of recommendations. where a man was available within the business organization, who was well trained in the business and was a natural logician and analyst, we always recommended that such man be placed in charge of the statistical division and be backed up by one or two juniors trained in the details of statistical technique. on the other hand, if no such man was available within the organization, we suggested the alternative procedure of engaging a man skilled in logical processes and statistical technique, and giving him as thorough a training as possible in the details of the business, before calling upon him to analyze its operations. this again was an unexpected result from our experience, and its special interest for the present occasion lies in the fact that it indicates rather clearly, i believe, the position and true functions of the statistical association. statisticians as a group will hold indefinitely their traditional interest in census work and vital statistics, and in public statistics as a whole and they will thus, of necessity, maintain specially close contacts with the social sciences. nevertheless, the primary field for the activities of the statistical association will always be that of the development and extension into use of a correct and effective statistical methodology, as a thing apart from specific applications. the statistical work in astronomy must be done primarily by astronomers, and in biology by biologists, and in each science by those who are trained primarily in that science and only secondarily in the statistical method. to these scientists the statistical association can extend only cooperation in methodology and a convenient meeting place for comparisons and interchanges of statistical technique. there is, however, a growing field in which the statistical association may function with very great usefulness. it is difficult to limit, even if it were desirable to do so, the extension of the scientific method into new fields nor can we say that advertising and marketing, or industrial organization, or even the art of investing, may not become in time as true sciences as any of those that are today recognized by that name. this scientific pioneering must of necessity be mainly, if not wholly, statistical in nature, and it is here that this association plays a specially useful part as a source of inspiration and guidance for those who are taking the first steps in the application of exact research in new fields and to new ranges of human activity. the statistical association has, in fact, become a unique meeting ground in which the utmost refinements of the scientific method come face to face with the most practical of practical affairs. it is the gathering place, above all others, where scientific men tend to become practical and practical men tend to become scientific. this very special characteristic of the association's activities confers a great opportunity, and at the same time imposes a great obligation, upon technically trained statisticians and teachers of statistics. there ie special need for the translation of the statistical philosophy into simple language and of the statistical technique into simple rule of thumb formulae similar to those used by engineers and other practical technicians. the statistician in commerce and industry, or in any one of the newer fields of practical applications, tends very properly to work with a minimum of mathematics. yet it is highly important that he shall work scientifically and shall have a very clear conception of the circumstances under which the mathematical refinements of technique may be applied with safety and profit. in considering the refinements and modifications of the scientific method which particularly apply to the work of the statistician, the first point to be emphasized is that the statistician is always dealing with probabilities and degrees of uncertainty. he is, in effect, a sherlock holmes of figures, who must work mainly, or wholly, from circumstantial evidence. and, just as the sherlock holmes of fiction must prove by successive steps, first, that the murder was committed, and, second, that the suspect had a motive for the crime and was on the scene at the critical moment, and, finally, that no one else could have been guilty so the statistical detective must learn to approach each complicated problem from aa many independent angles as possible and must combine and weigh and balance the results of the solutions at which he arrives. in this connection the criminal parallel is too tempting not to be carried a step further for the trained worker will never complete and pass final judgment upon an analysis without first appointing counsel for the defense. in other words, after establishing his proof, he will promptly set to work, in person or by capable proxy, to show that the whole demonstration, if it proves anything at all, leads to the exact opposite of the conclusions originally announced. if the statistician can learn thus wholeheartedly to wreck his own fondest hopes in the manner i have described, he will have taken his first firm step in the scientific pathway. and, to gain fortitude for further steps, he may console himself with the thought that if he should pursue his statistical prey through the thickets of uncertainty and should hang the culprit finally on the gallows tree of fact, that very success might be his own undoing and might add him to the great army of the unemployed. it is, in fact, fortunate for the profession that so many of our problem and most notably our old friend the business cycle are living under suspended sentences, and require constant surveillance. but sherlock holmes is proving too tempting an illustration, and i must get back to fundamentals. when the pioneer statistician has once realized the importance of setting up, so far as possible, not only one, but several, independent proofs of his conclusions, he must next learn to state these conclusions in accurate and useful terms. these must cover not only the most probable values or relations, but also the reasonable maximum limits of variation, or, for practical purposes, the range within which there are nine chances in ten, or ninety nine chances in one hundred that the true results will lie. at this point the scientific pathfinder is perhaps ready to consider certain refinements of the inductive deductive method. as practically applied, this method is, however, rarely the simple sequence of observation, hypothesis, and statistical verification that is described in the text books, but usually involves many successive alternations of these processes. in the attack on a blind problem it is always necessary to assemble the perfectly obvious data, and then to examine such data to determine what collateral figures are required and frequently this alternation between the collection, and the examination and expansion of data must be repeated several times before the first tentative hypothesis can be developed to indicate cause and effect relations, or the lines along which controlled statistical experiments may be con ducted. as the next stage in his education, it is important that the statistical pioneer shall realize, once for all, that a coefficient of co variation may not properly be described as a coefficient of correlation until the possibilities of chance co variation have been calculated. i am not sure, in fact, that statistical science might not gain greatly if the coefficient of correlation should be defined as a coefficient of covariation, supplemented by a calculation of the chances that such co variation may be accidental. furthermore, it is not possible to emphasize too often the fact that even a coefficient of correlation thus safe guarded establishes no presumption whatever as to cause and effect relations between the variables. this must be my excuse for calling attention to the very high correlation that undoubtedly exists between the number of truckmen on the new york city streets and the percentage of sulphur in the new york city air. on superficial examination of this coefficient, the technically trained observer might find the source of the sulphur in the exhaust gasses of the trucks while other observers specially familiar with the environment might find the source of the sulphur in the vitriolic language that the truckmen use in their more animated and stressful moments. however, it is needless to say that a scientific study of the phenomena would probably indicate that both sulphur and trucks were functions of business activity. but here, again, i am wandering away from the serious treatment that statistical problem deserve. the crimes are numberless that are committed in the name of the coefficient of correlation, and particularly in the name of the multiple correlation of time series. our experts might, therefore, perform a real service by developing mathematically, as i believe they can, the fact that any random time series, however extended, may be expressed with increasing accuracy in terms of other similar random series, as the number of such other series is increased. this is particularly true when the element of time advance or lag is introduced. the coefficient of correlation is bad enough as a measuring stick it is wholly impossible as an argument. along lines similar to the preceding, it has long since been demonstrated that any time series, random or otherwise, may be completely resolved by the harmonic analysis, without such resolution having any 8 statistical association [8 significance whatsoever with respect to inherent regular periodicities in the data. and in 'the reverse direction it has repeatedly been shown that practically all our economic time series can be reproduced in substantial facsimile by the mere throwing of dice. yet a make belief in the regularity of economic cycles persists, and crops up perennially in new forms, regardless of both fact and theory. the dangers that lie in undue reliance upon coefficients of correlation, the harmonic analysis, and other forms of rigid mathematical treatment of complex statistical data can hardly be overestimated. i am inclined, in fact, to believe it should be a matter of fundamental principle for all statistical conclusions to be reached primarily through logical and experimental processes, supplemented by very simple numerical and graphical analysis. the more elaborate mathematical treatment should then be applied, if necessary, as a check and verification of the results that have been arrived at by these other means. i had hoped, on this occasion, to touch briefly on each of the fundamental operations of the statistical procedure and to suggest, at least very tentatively, those modifications that might result from a purely logical and non mathematical analysis. but even the simplest of our statistical operations, when thus approached, rose up, so to speak, and demanded a full chapter, at least, for an adequate treatment. when we smooth a statistical series, are we justified in eliminating variations that are not provably within the limits of error in observations or of known chance irregularities in data? and if we go further, by eliminating, variations due to isolatable cause and effect relations, in order to observe more readily those variations that are due to unknown causes, is not this an adjustment of the data for our special and immediate purposes, rather than a true smoothing and does not the same point of view apply when we arbitrarily suppress short term variations in order to study more closely those of longer periodicity? similar questions arise when we consider our equally common practice of interpolation and extrapolation. how can we determine the probable error in such operations, as a thing apart from the chances of actual changes in trend? what differences in probable error arise when we extrapolate along the lines of logically justified mathematical curve forms, rather than by means of empirically determined or arbitrary curves? how far can such probable errors be determined mathematically, and to what extent must they be estimated on the basis of the statistician's intimate knowledge of the data? these illustrations of the logical problems that arise when we con sider even the simplest of our statistical procedures might be continued indefinitely. only during the last few weeks i have had occasion to set up a great variety of economic growth curves on a per capita basis, and have been amazed to discover how many of such curves could be represented with a high degree of accuracy by plotting them on an arithmetic time scale in terms of the cumulation of a normal frequency distribution. to state this fact in other words, the majority of these curves can be plotted as straight lines on hazen's cumulative probability paper, using a simple arithmetic time scale as the base. such plotting is very effective for automobile registrations, automobile replacement demand, telephone and electric light and power development, and many other economic and industrial trends that are headed toward definite per capita saturations. i do not need to say that the fitting of growth curves to straight lines on this special plotting paper has little significance when only a fraction of a curve is concerned. however, this significance becomes very great when an exact fitting is obtained with respect to a growth curve that has approached within 20 to 30 percent of its saturation point. the statistical results just referred to are of special interest, beyond their immediate practical applications, insofar as they furnish one more example of the tendency for the mathematical characteristics of the normal frequency distribution to crop up in unexpected places. this persistent tendency seems to justify the assumption now being made by many mathematical investigators that the great part of all frequency distributions would be of the normal form if we could deal directly with the items that really varied. here, again, i believe that our experts can render a special service by continuing their investigations and by setting up the philosophy of frequency distributions and mathematically related series in such manner that the statistical pioneer may use this philosophy aa a practical guide in his investigations. but i am perhaps venturing into deep statistical waters, so let me revert to my earlier comparisons and a more immediately practical point of view, by suggesting the importance of the statistical third degree. the verification of conclusions by means of controlled statistical experiments is very rarely possible in the social sciences, and the impracticability of such experiments results too often in excessive reliance upon theory and pure correlations. nevertheless, there are many direct verifications of cause and effect relations in economic phenomena that, while fragmentary and incomplete in themselves, may still be of convincing value in combination with the results of other analyses. as a specific and somewhat odd illustration, we may take the correlation between daily weather conditions and the lunch time patronage 10 statistical association p o of restaurants. on first examination, the situation is confusing. some restaurants show a positive correlation between fine weather and the number of lunches served. others show a negative correlation, and still a third group reveal no definite correlation whatever. from the standpoint of pure statistics the problem is perhaps in soluble. yet a few direct inquiries will not only reveal the real facts, but add an unexpected significance to the data. stormy weather reduces somewhat the total number of lunches eaten in restaurants. but its more important effect is to drive custom into unattractive nearby restaurants, that in fair weather would go to more attractive restaurants at a distance. the attractive restaurant shows a positive correlation between trade and sunshine. the unattractive restaurant profits from cloudy skies. another example of this practical form of verification is in connection with the assumption that there is a direct cause and effect relation between interest rates on second mortgages and the volume of building construction. it has been stated that the reduced building activity of recent months was directly ascribable to the high cost of second mortgage financing. nevertheless, even the most sketchy inquiry of those directly concerned with the handling of second mortgages will show that the difficulty lies not in a shortage of second mortgage money, but in a shortage of second mortgage confidence. the real obstacle to construction at the present time is the fear that building investments made at current levels of cost, and in the face of apparent building surpluses, might be wholly unprofitable. it is this checking of circumstantial evidence by the forcing of a direct confession from the statistical culprit that may properly be described as the application of the statistical third degree. and no professional sentimentalism should be allowed to prevent a full development of the possibilities of this procedure. the statistician, as the chief pathfinder among scientific pioneers, must necessarily combine that vision which comes from fertility, breadth, and incisiveness of hypothesis, with the balance and sureness of step of the scientific method as a whole. but, above all, he must possess something of the rude spirit of the frontiersman and must seek his results in every legitimate way, regardless of refinements of method and rigidity of conventions.

Ogburn","1908-1939","my predecessors in office have discussed before you in a series of able addresses most of the aspects of statistics that are of interest to a general audience of social scientists. yet, statistics is one of those words, like democracy or science, the meaning of which never seems exhausted. and so i have thought that by comparing statistics and art, some new light might be thrown on the place of statistics in the theory of knowledge. but if i am presumptuous in these expectations, i am sure such a comparison will be productive at least of an emphasis much needed today. statistics has been developed to give an exact picture of reality, while the picture that the artist draws is a distortion of reality. even the portrait painter does not want to be photographic. the statistician wishes to make the probable error as small as possible; while the artist must always, so to speak, have an error. with some of the cubists, as, for instance, the painter of the famous picture of the so called nude descending the so called staircase, the purpose seems to have been to produce an error as large as possible. the artist, being impressionistic, is as little realistic as he can afford to be. but since art is a form of communication varying degrees of realism are demanded from age to age and from situation to situation, for without a sufficiently realistic medium the message is not adequately communicated. the reason why the artist wants to change reality is that reality is unkind to him. he is uncomfortable in it and comes to have an inner message that is more beautiful to him than reality. the distortion he makes is an improvement of reality. his art is a product of his dream world expressed in terms of beauty. art is not, of course, the only sphere conspicuous for its departure from reality. the beliefs of the religious are signal distortions of reality. the belief in life after death is undoubtedly correlated with our hopes. heavens are pleasant places in which to live, and the forms our souls take after death are such as we would like to have them take. the man of god finds this vale of tears and abode of sin a hard place to live in. and so the symbols, rituals and divinities in religion all serve to release him from the bonds of the here and now. thus there is comfort and solace in religion, just as there is harmony in the works of the artist. underlying both art and religion is the fundamental maladjustment of psychological nature to environment. but the way out is different. for the artist it is beauty; for the man of faith it is belief. nor is the distortion of reality confined to the artist and the religious. the insane find a less attractive way out. Day dreamers and idealists find their escape in dreams. the unreal world of fiction, of stories of romance and adventure, are outlets for others of us whose adjustments do not satisfy our wishes. so universal is this habit of distorting reality that it may be said to be human. it is a habit that has to be unlearned by every statistician, the hardest task in his training. the artist, the religious and the insane take more liberties with reality than other groups such as social reformers and promoters who are held within more reasonable bounds. while, therefore, there are many groups who misrepresent, artists may be singled out for comparison with statisticians because the distortions of artists are more like those which statistics seeks to prevent and to remedy. this comparison may be approached by relating an incident that occurred once when i was attempting to mediate some labor difficulties in a steel plant. the morning i arrived the difficulties came to a head. i called at once to see the manager, and asked how many men were on strike. he replied that, indeed, there was no strike, that they were all just a happy family, but admitted that 200 men didnt report for work that morning. i then went out to talk with the agent of the union, and he told me excitedly that the plant would be closed completely by afternoon and that there were out on strike at that moment. the true number proved to be about. their statistics were not very accurate. they were both distorting reality in trying to make their respective worlds more comfortable for them. here, as is so often the case, exact measurement eliminated errors due to prejudice. our language shows how strongly artistic and how little scientific we are. this is particularly true of the words of children, of poets, and of the folk. for instance, goldenrod :is neither golden nor is it a rod; but goldenrod is a beautiful name as becomes a beautiful flower, and we like the distortion because of the charm in the associations it calls forth. we much prefer to call delphinium tricorne by the name of larkspur than by its scientific name, even if the resemblance of the flower to the spur of a lark is only slight. it is pleasant to think of so beautiful a songster as a lark having a spur like this lovely flower. similarly our adjectives are often colorful and do not lend themselves readily to accuracy. thus the air is only hot or cold, or perhaps cool or warm. none of these expressions is very accurate, for we want this room 68 degrees warm, no more, no less. so we record refined measurement by expressing the adjective in terms of degrees. the adjectives tall and short have been refined into inches. many adjectives still are enemies to accuracy, however. for, who would want us to say that the mona lisa was only degrees beautiful. but perhaps the judges in a beauty contest for miss america do have such a beauty thermometer. the point may be further illustrated by comparing the first five adjectives in keats ode to a nightingale with the first five adjectives from egon pearsons article on the test of significance for the correlation coefficient appearing in the journal of the statistical association. Keats adjectives are the following: drowsy, dull, happy, light winged, and melodious; while pearsons are the following : statistical, alternative, observed, little, and numerical. the number of adjectives per 100 words in keats ode is two and one half times as large as the number in pearsons article on correlation. it is interesting also to note that h. g. wells? outline of history ranked in this regard just half way between keats poem and pearsons article. while statistics should render an exact account of reality, they do not always succeed in doing so. it is not so much that figures lie, as the old saying goes, as that liars figure. but if statistics were truly successful in preventing distortions, liars could not figure and get away with it. in social theory, in literature, and in philosophy there is no measure of the error, and the distorting effects of wishes are less easy to isolate than in statistics. statistics has given much more attention to the error in samples caused by a multitude of small causes, i.e., chance, than it has to the error due to a single large cause, as, for instance, prejudice. the theory of errors is one of the great achievements of science; but now more attention should be given to tests for the representativeness of samples from heterogeneous phenomena. indeed, such a problem is not now thought of as a matter of statistics, but rather of psychology. for how can statistics prevent liars from figuring? under the present status of conditions it is better to follow freud than gauss. yet the place of statistics in the scheme of knowledge is as the champion of exactness and, surely, selection and representativeness in samples are of the greatest importance. all inventions have a limited use at the beginning. the shortcomings of statistics in this regard are most clearly seen in the case of statistical description. the point is well illustrated in a story told about bernard shaw and sidney webb. in the early days of the fabians, webb is said to have read a paper on the growth of municipal ownership, made up largely of statistical statements. shaw criticized it as a grossly inaccurate presentation. webb replied hotly with a challenge to show a single error in any statement. shaw replied that of course all the statements were accurate, but that the whole, which was not the sum of the parts, was quite inaccurate since the municipalities that had not gone in for ownership had been omitted, making the paper give the picture of a stampede toward municipal ownership, which was far from the case. curiously, the artist proved the better statistician. description of multiple phenomena, such as a country, a people, or an epoch necessarily involves selection. that is why history must be rewritten in every age. where the opportunities for selection are many, there we may expect to find the artist, the arch enemy of statistics. it may be argued that the scientist in drawing a generalization is doing what the artist does. it is true that they both select but the purpose of the scientist is o be exact while the purpose of the artist is to change reality. selection is at the very basis of our thinking which is largely a process of selecting a few memories and observations from the many possible ones. this sampling from the vast storehouse of our memories is not a very representative process. it is well known that we are prone to select that which is pleasing to remember. and so we recall the good old days. our memories of childhood are treacherous misrepresentations, while our national heroes such as the founder of our nation, become changed beyond all recognition. so powerful is this selective force that the face of reality is changed completely sometimes, as when we have hallucinations, which a sizeable percentage of us do have at times; that is, we hear voices when there are none and see mirages when there is nothing but atmosphere. it is this distorting influence of emotion and wishes that is more responsible for bad thinking than any lack of logic. this selective nature of thought and observation is very well seen in the milder cases of manic depressive insanity when the individual at one time can see nothing but clouds with no silver lining anywhere in the future, while a little later in their manic phase all will be sun shine with never a fear; views of reality quite unjustified by the facts. statistical descriptions are not wholly helpless before the selective tendencies. in most cases the statistical material is so scanty that one can ill afford to omit. the convention, today, is to survey all available statistical information. on the other hand, confining description only to statistical material itself produces a bias because of the omission of the non statistical account. furthermore the task of getting a representative sample from a complex universe is not insuperable. indeed, the very raising of the question puts one on guard against biased samples. still the problem of representative samples is of cardinal importance for statistics. further comparison of statistics and art reveals another important limitation of statistics. to the artist, statistical knowledge seems woefully inadequate. the artist is interested in imparting and receiving ideas that are rich in feeling tones. they must carry associations and awaken emotional recognition. statistics seem bare. the inadequacy of statistical knowledge is like the inadequacy of theology to the religious. the artist that is in us wants understanding rather than statistics. but understanding is hardly knowledge; it is rather what knowledge means to us, i.e., to our rich collection of associations. knowledge and understanding are at opposite ends of a continuous distribution. how many of us have an understanding of how far 93,000,000 miles are? yet to know that the sun is that far away is very useful knowledge. numbers as well as statistical symbols do not yet carry meanings as readily as does the folk language. the problem of the meaning, and presentation of statistics is most important as mr. leonard ayres showed so clearly in his presidential address before the statistical association a few years ago. the tests of knowledge are reliability and accuracy, not understanding. indeed it is quite possible to have a satisfying understanding of something that doesnt exist. thus one may understand how the sun moves around the earth. a person, untrained scientifically may live for a long time among another people and come to have a very good understanding of them; yet he would scarcely be called a scientist. his understanding would not be of that accurate, systematic, transferable kind called science. and so there would always be uncertainty as to how much he had misrepresented reality, unless it has been placed in objective verifiable form. to a visitor, scandinavians may be tall, blue eyed blonds with long heads and long faces, yet science shows that such an observation is a distortion of reality, for only about fifteen percent of them fit this description. understanding comes to the extent that knowledge is correlated with past experiences and associations. poets and novelists are much more successful in conveying understandings than statisticians and psychologists. this lack of appreciation of the difference between knowledge and understanding is thought to be the reason for much of the argument that the scientific procedures in the social sciences must be fundamentally different from those in the physical sciences. statistical knowledge is peculiarly disappointing to those who fuse emotion with knowledge. the inadequacy of statistical knowledge is not so much a problem of statistics as it is a problem of the diffusion of statistics. this inadequacy is the very cause of its success, which rests on the fact that it is practical. artists, poets, musicians and children are notoriously impractical, for reality to them is an inner reality. the statistician is essentially practical, interested in the outer reality and in eliminating the biasing effect of the inner feelings. this close connection between statistics and the reality of the outside world explains a good many aspects of statistical development. for instance, it explains why certain impractical mathematicians do not make good practical statisticians. it also explains why statistics in psychology is different from statistics in economics. statistical method must vary according to subject matter. hence, statistics must be taught in the various departments of universities where it is applied. for these reasons statistics tends to break up into separate disciplines, somewhat as philosophy did. this tendency, by the way, may be of some significance for the future of the statistical association. for instance the statistical association may take over the statistical activities of the other social science associations, or these associations may take over the jurisdiction of statistics dealing with their subject matter with the result that the statistical association confine its activities largely to methodology. the chief obstacle to the latter development is that methodological inventions arise from attacks on specific kinds of subject matter and cannot be developed apart from the special social sciences. another possibility ,is that the statistical association may expand in such a way as to sweep more and more different subjects into its orbit, developing sections on medical statistics, engineering statistics, psychological statistics, biological statistics, in which case statistics will appear in the r61e of the unifier of the social sciences, per haps as the one great social science. the rapid extensions of statistical technique into the various disciplines during the past decade are in this direction. before closing it may be well to affirm, lest there be misunderstanding, that accuracy and verification are not the whole story of science nor of statistics. it is quite recognized that hypotheses have to be formulated and that here is a drive back of research which calls for the constructive imagination of the artist, without which there could be no research. and it is also recognized that the aesthetic satisfaction that comes after a beautiful piece of research is somewhat akin to that which the artist experiences. in conclusion, then, the apology for pausing a while this evening to reflect on the nature of art and of statistics lies in the great prevalence of the distorting tendencies of the human mind particularly in the social field and the great success which statistics has in combating these tendencies. we carry around in our heads pictures that are not like the photographs of reality. as children we begin life as artists personifying nature. we grow up still twisting reality out of shape with our faith and belief, as idealists, optimists, and pessimists, nervous, full of imaginary fears, doing all we can not to see life accurately. and in the occupations we follow we are bent on further twisting reality. as leaders, social reformers, religionists, journalists, entrepreneurs, promoters, advertisers we want to distort reality in ways peculiar to each occupation. as human beings we all wear colored glasses. this is the material nature has given us out of which to make scientists. no wonder they are so scarce. it may be noted as a sort of complement to this array of human nature that the business of society can stand only a very few scientists and still fewer statisticians, perhaps not more than a fraction of one percent. nor does a statistician want to be a scientist more than a part of each 365 days. but we do need the results of statisticians, and in order to get them we need good scientists, not cross breeds. next, let us look at some of the issues on which we want scientific knowledge. there is war, one can hardly think of it without getting emotional. the word, war, almost suggests misrepresentation of facts. another problem is the distribution of wealth, the factors surrounding which are so easily colored by our prejudices. other problems with which we should deal, without distorting them, are strikes, labor unions, political parties, communism, religion, sex, the family, women, parents and children, races, tariffs, monopolies, eugenics; all problems capable of arousing the most violent prejudices. it is not surprising therefore that in the social sciences the forces of art have overshadowed statistics. nature, the subject matter of natural sciences, was once distorted and colored. the stars were candles hung out by the angels; thunder the voice of an angry deity. strange as it may seem, nature was once the happy hunting ground of the wishful thinkers. but science succeeded in neutralizing it. we do not see ghosts, gnomes and fairies any more; and, parenthetically nature is still just as beautiful to the artist. can the neutralization of society be accomplished by the colorless statistician and scientist? for instance, shall we cease to personify social forces as great men and heroes? shall we quit thinking of the negro and the eskimo as being inferior in mental ability? shall we de personalize heredity and admit that it has little or nothing to do with personality of normal human beings? whatever the measuring scientist may find, the artist in us has given him a first rate task to do in regard to social institutions and their functioning. it is only desirable that society become neutralized to us as statisticians, not as artists or as human beings. finally, however forbidding the neutralization of society may be, the reward is knowledge, control and power.

has long seemed to me that students of the social sciences, especially sociology and economics, have spent too much time in discussing what they call methodology. i have usually felt that the man who essays to tell the rest of us how to solve knotty problems would be more convincing if first he proved out his alleged method by solving a few himself. apparently those would be authorities who are forever telling others how to get results do not get any important results themselves. i well remember, nearly forty years ago, hearing a newly fledged professor of sociology deliver a learned lecture on methodology in sociology full of big words if not of big ideas. but he never, as long as he lived, contributed anything more than advising others how to do it. so far as i know, no one was ever materially helped by his advice. and now here i am myself adding my own quota to the literature, already so big and so largely useless, on this perennially fascinating, if somewhat unprofitable, subject of method. in excuse i may say that this is only my second offense, the first being twenty six years ago, and that i have hitherto, for the most part, tried to mind my own business and to saw my own wood instead of instructing others how to saw theirs. but i think my real reason for now and here breaking out on methodology is simply that it seems a suitable subject for me to choose in representing tonight both the statistical association and the econometric society, the oldest and the youngest of the scientific bodies devoted to the study of economic and social problems. may i begin by saying that i am chiefly interested in both those societies as an economist, and i shall, accordingly, confine myself to the subject of statistics in the service of economics and only to one part of that vast subject, namely economic theory. when, forty two years ago, i wrote my doctor's thesis on certain mathematical investigations in the theory of value and prices, i was a student of mathematical physics and, with youthful enthusiasm, dreamed dreams of seeing economics, or one branch of it, grow into a true science by the same methods which had long since built up physics into a true and majestic science. of course, i was not the first to have such dreams for economics as a science. several others had dreamed those dreams before me. but some of these had too often found that the market for their wares was small and discouraging. the book which first fired my youthful enthusiasm was that of austrian bankers who, like another banker before them wrote a highly theoretical treatise. but i found, when i visited vienna in 1893 that the readers of their investigation on the theory of value and prices had been very few. i know of no economist except myself who has even read this notable book. a year later, in 1894, i heard read a paper in the field of mathematical economics before the british association for the advancement of science, and heard the, to me, unjustified criticism of it by, representing the typical economist of that time. it was with distress that i heard say he felt"" damped"" by hearing deplore the introduction into economics of such heretical methods as anathematic. even in those days was almost unknown among economists and had only barely been rescued from oblivion. like the now famous mendel in biology, in economics is an example of a scientist little appreciated until after he had died, and his work had, for a time, been forgotten. a little later i again found that a contemporary of had produced what i regarded then, and regard now, as a work of genius, deserving to rank, as to scientific method and results, far ahead of the wealth of nations, of which it was, in part, a criticism. work was not mathematical. it is easy reading and fascinating to those who read it. with professor who discovered neglected work and recognized him as a i did my best to help resurrect book, originally called new principles of political economy. later this was reprinted. arranged and annotated by professor under the title, sociological theory of capital. i also dedicated my own books on interest to. but even now great book has not fully come to life. not only exemplified what seems to me a correct method but he correctly described a scientific methodology and contrasted his method with the unscientific method. since there are no mathematical symbols in book, its failure to receive the prompt and full recognition it deserved must be due to something else than mathematics. it may have been in part his very methodology, which i so much admire but which at that time had no audience ready to appreciate it. the difficulties encountered in getting most professed economists to adopt the methods of physical science made me nearly despair of ever living to see economics become a science in the sense that physics is a science. a young economist in a western university, who sees eye to eye with me as to methodology, shocked and pained me about twenty years ago when he told me that his own enthusiasm had been so damped that he had practically given up his original life ambition of getting recognition for his contributions toward making economics into a true and useful science. but he was too easily discouraged. for even at that time, those of us who had still earlier entered economics from the approach of the natural sciences, as contrasted with the approach from philosophy or history, had already noticed a great change. and today we suddenly wake up to realize that the methods which have made physics a science have at last taken a vigorous hold on the rising generation of economists. moreover, the establishment of the international econometric society two years ago, the meetings it has since held in europe and america, and its journal econometrica beginning next month, signalize this new birth of the scientific spirit in economics. but what is the essence of the scientific method which these young economists have at heart? i shall try to interpret it. and i would also refer you to the interpretation of in a brilliant article to appear in the first number of econometrica. as i understand it, this new outburst of the scientific spirit is not a new ""school"" but simply an adaptation to economics of methods already nobly tested in the natural sciences. i hope it may mark the beginning of the end of ""schools"" in the sense of partisan groups or cults. the modern economist occupies a position midway between what used to be called the austrian school and the historical school. in america, the honor of contributing the fundamental idea of or marginal utility as it has usually been called in english, or ""final degree of utility"" as it was called by, an idea corresponding closely to differential quotients as used in mathematics and mathematical physics. nevertheless the first enthusiasm over the austrian school's concept of marginal utility and its application was followed by disappointment. the austrian school seemed to yield no second crop comparable with the first. one would be facetious critic wrote an article on ""the final futility of final utility."" professor (afterward president) voiced this disappointment when he said: we are teaching more about the theory of utility than did our fathers; but are we doing so much for the realization of that theory in the organized life of the nation? if we fail in our influence upon public life, we fail in what is the most important application of our studies, and in what may almost be said to constitute their fundamental reason for existence. the older political economy expressed its results in pounds, shillings and pence. they might be true or they might be false, but they were at any rate in a form where they were capable of measurement and verification. the new political economy has substituted a more vague conception of wealth for the more concrete one, and many of its propositions have suffered a corresponding loss of clearness and precision. the mercantile school of economists had measured wealth in terms of money. the first generation of their critics measured it in terms of food; the second and third generations measured it as "" commodities""; our own generation measures it in terms of utility. but food is 11less definite and tangible measure than money; commodities are a less definite and tangible measure than food; and utility is perhaps the least definite and tangible measure of all. i am disposed to think seriously that the excessive use of psychological terms and conceptions, to the neglect of purely commercial ones, has been the most potent cause to weaken the influence of economists among statesmen and men of the world. president hadley was right. the austrian school, though marginal utility was a real contribution, obviously lacked a full contact with reality. and yet the german historical school, though it stressed realities, was even more disappointing. starting off with a commendable reverence for facts, just as does the physicist, they mistook their compilations for ""induction"" in economics. they got nowhere. their ponderous volumes contained vast collections of historical facts and statistics but there was little or no connecting framework of principle. both the austrian deductive school and the german historical school have now ceased to command much enthusiasm; for some time the effort has been to find a satisfactory way to join together theoretical and historical studies. this effort has found expression through mathematics and statistics and mathematical statistics the mathematics to express theory and the statistics to express historical facts. the econometric society, as stated in its constitution, stands for the ""advancement of economic theory in its relation to statistics and mathematics."" no one today needs to apologize for, or even defend, either statistics or mathematics as legitimate and helpful instruments in the service of economics. both are found abundantly in any modem economic journal. the statistical association now has an entire journal devoted to mathematical statistics. any modern text book of advanced economics will usually contain tables and charts of statistics, diagrams of supply and demand and some mathematical formulae, if only in the appendices. this has all come about so gradually that anyone who will take the trouble to compare modem economic literature with that of one and two generations ago, even by turning a few of the pages at random, and looking for diagrams and formulae, will be startled at the contrasts. in his principles made no use of mathematical symbols or of statistics. even when i was a student, the leading economic work of the time, the advanced course, as walker's text book was called, contained no statistics or mathematics. in my doctor's thesis in 1891, i devoted several pages to defending the use of mathematics in economics against the objections then alleged against it. yet mathematical method merely consists in the use of symbols as short. hand expressions of measurable magnitudes, and statistical method merely"" consists in the study of social phenomena which can be counted."" thus they are conveniences rather than necessities. that is, while statistics and mathematics are, or can be made, helpful in joining theory and fact into a true economic science, they are incidents rather than indispensable instruments for that purpose. scientific economics will naturally make liberal use of mathematics and statistics. but the essential of scientific method is not a matter of form but of substance. the first essential, in my opinion, is to recognize the absolute distinction between scientific and historical truth, that is between principles and phenomena. my impression is that few, if any, economic students ever grasp this fundamental distinction who have not had some considerable training in the physical sciences. a scientific truth is in the conditional form: ""if a is true, then b is true""; while an historical fact is in the unconditional form: ""a is true"" or ""b is true."" if this distinction were clearly grasped by every student who wishes to understand and discover sound economic principles, economics would, i believe, develop into a true science very speedily. until the great majority of our students do grasp this distinction, much of economic writing will be pseudo science either of the type of half baked economic theory or of half baked economic history. as i said in 1906, when chairman of the economic section of the association for the advancement of science: those who maintain that economics is not and never can be zero. true science base their contention on the fact that social phenomena are not constant, like, they say, the phenomena of astronomy or physics, but differ widely at different times and under different circumstances. they point out that the determination of 'prices under modem free competition is quite different from their determination under the mediaeval system of custom and status; that the remuneration of labor depends on what are the historical and legal institutions with respect to slavery, labor legislation, etc.; that the economic phenomena of to day are not comparable with those of the times of the greeks and romans, nor are the phenomena in america comparable with those in russia. to one who is familiar with the spirit of science, however, these variations, so far from being objections, are really confirmations of the theory that economics is zero. science. for in all science it is fundamentally true that phenomena will differ according to circumstances, and the office of the scientist is simply and solely to find out under what circumstances one set of phenomena will occur, and under what circumstances another set will occur. we could hardly claim that hydrostatics is not zero. science for the reason that, in zero. mountain lake, water is found to be stationary and at zero. level, whereas at niagara it is found to be in motion and passing from one level to another; that, whereas the water in zero. Mill race passes in zero. downward direction, the water which we draw in our houses moves through the pipes upward; that whereas, by means of zero. syphon, water may be induced to flow out of a receptacle, it will, in an ordinary tub, remain inert. the whole science of hydraulics has developed as a consequence of the persistent effort to unravel these puzzles, and today we know not only that under different circumstances water will act in different ways, but we can formulate what are the precise conditions under which it will act in each separate manner. in economic study we should in like manner apply ourselves to discover what conditions make the difference in the phenomena between modem and ancient or eastern and western civilizations, rather than content ourselves with the truism that they do differ. much of the field has in fact already been covered. it is known, for instance, that under conditions of free contract and competition, the price of an article will be determined by the intersection of its supply and demand curves, and that, on the other hand, if the be one of monopoly, the price will be determined on the principle of ""what the traffic will bear,"" in the manner so admirably shown by. in these cases the results are not absolute and unconditional, but depend on specified hypotheses. in this respect they are exactly similar to any other scientific result. if economics is zero. science, its truths must be conditional. thus, the incidence of a tax on ground rent will lower the value of land, provided there are no counteracting causes. this does not assert that actually, after such zero. tax, the value of the land will fall; for in the meantime some opposing cause may have intervened, such as the discovery of an oil well. again, an increase of the quantity of circulating medium will raise prices proportionately, provided the velocity of circulation and the volume of business transactions remain the same. this quantity theory does not assert that prices do rise after every increase in the quantity of money, and those who thus interpret it are guilty of the confusion already noted between conditional and unconditional truth in other words, between a scientific law and an historical fact. true science does not consist in the mere grouping of historical phenomena. in fact, bacon makes a distinction between what he calls the popular and the inductive method, or what may be preferably called, following the example of, the systematic and the scientific. the two are commonly confused, but are entirely distinct. system consists in classifying phenomena; ""science"" consists in discovering the laws to which they conform. system explains phenomena by means of what is common and familiar; science explains them by what is simple, however recondite. system is exemplified in such descriptive studies as grammar, descriptive geography and history; science is exemplified by such analytical studies as mathematics, physics, and latterly, biology. the classifier or system maker is content with generalization of facts. these express the usual order of events: for instance, that the sun rises once a day. they do not express the reason or principle. many studies which are now scientific had their origin in what was originally systematic. the predecessors of the modem physicists classified bodies into light and heavy. iron, they maintained, is heavy and therefore falls; fire is not heavy, and therefore rises. how different is this obsolete method of treating the subject from our modem analytic notion of gravity, or rate of increase of velocity, by means of which are explained both the falling of iron and the rising of ""fire"" i similarly, the prototype of biology was ""natural history,"" and consisted chiefly in the mere classification of animals and plants into species, genera, etc. modem biology has supplanted such elaborate classification by introducing, through darwin, the analytical ideas of heredity, variation and selection, and in this way the descriptive study of natural history has been converted into the true science of biology. and mendel's laws have added insight to darwin's and given us absolute mathematical conclusions in terms of probabilities and, in some oases, of certainties. we know if two blue eyed persons marry all their children will have blue eyes. if a is true, then b is true. the same evolution which has been outlined in physical and biological science is doubtless taking place in economic science. yet it must be confessed that few have yet mastered the distinction between a general fact and a scientific law. when we hear it stated as fundamental in political economy that skilled labor is better paid than unskilled, it is clear that this is merely a general rule and not a necessary law. the single fact that certain seamstresses, though skilled, are ill paid, is sufficient to disprove the statement as a necessary law, though it does not affect it as a general fact. the historical school justly complains of the superficial character of the theories which have been sometimes offered. this objection holds, however, not against theory as such, but against false theories; and herein lies the virtue of bacon's method. the inductive method, by which any theory of phenomena must be checked by reference to actual historical fact, thus forms the means of distinguishing between truth and falsity. rejecting false theories is quite different from rejecting all theories. what is needed now in political economy is to rid ourselves of the false and superficial theories, on the one hand, which have been constructed, a priori and irrespective of facts; and, on the other hand, to release ourselves from the cheap empiricism of the historical school, who interpret their task as merely one of generalizing phenomena without analyzing them. science is one. the logic for economic science should be the logic for all science a combination of induction and deduction. facts are at once the test and the material of science; but laws are its ultimate goal. laws are not facts, but the relations between facts. newton's first law of motion, that a body tends to move uniformly in a straight line, is not a fact, nor is it a general expression of facts. probably no particle in the universe has ever moved exactly in a straight line or with uniform velocity for so much as a single second. yet it would be an error to conclude that newton's law is unreal and untrue in actual nature. the law has an ""if"" in it "" if a body were acted on by no force, or by perfectly balanced forces, its motion would be uniform in both rate and direction."" withdrawn thus from actual events, newton's law seems to the non scientific mind to lose all objective truth. this again is an error. newton's law is absolutely true to nature. the fact that it is conditional does not make it arbitrary. we are not free to replace it by the mediaeval opinion, viz., ""if a body is let alone it will gradually spend its force and slacken its speed."" this formulation, unlike newton's law, would not stand the test of facts. a valid law is true at all times and places, in the sense that, should the particular conditions arise, the prescribed result would follow, but not in the sense that the particular conditions must needs ever arise. it is sometimes said that the ability to predict is the final test of science. but it is not a test of science only. successful prediction requires two conditions: one is a knowledge of science of what will happen under given circumstances; and the other, equally essential, is a knowledge of history of the particular circumstances of the present moment, out of which the future, to be predicted, will grow. failures of prediction are due to the lack of either of these two essential conditions. an example of a failure of prediction due to imperfect knowledge of facts is found in the case of the closure of the indian mints to silver in 1893. it was expected that the value of the silver rupee would be maintained at 16 pence. but no account was taken of the large coined hoards of silver among the natives. after these had been put into circulation the price of the rupee did eventually rise to 16 pence and has remained there. in this case the failure of prediction at first was due, not to any defect in monetary science, but to ignorance of indian history. usually, however, failures in economic prediction are due to the lack of scientific rather than of historical knowledge. in the civil war, when there was a premium on gold, the scientific explanation of which was really simple, the public attributed the premium to the machinations of speculators. accordingly, congress was induced to close the gold exchange; whereupon, to the consternation of the framers of this foolish prohibition, the premium on gold soared higher than ever. the result was a hasty and shamefaced repeal. experience of this kind is too common in economic legislation. it serves as a warning that we should know something of economic science before venturing to tamper with economic conditions. the men who need this warning most of all are those who despise all theories and call themselves practical. it is they who legislate a measure one day and have to repeal it the next. a truly practical man can predict how a measure will work, and his power so to do requires not only what is called ""practical"" but also what is called ""theoretical"" knowledge; a knowledge, in short, not only of history but of science. unfortunately as yet neither economic laws nor economic data are sufficiently known to enable economists to make safe predictions. in both respects it is still a backward science as compared with many others. a few months ago astronomers from california and japan came to new england to observe a total eclipse of the sun. the eclipse came off on schedule time within a second or two so nearly perfect is this superbly scientific science of astronomy. this was because these astronomers had both sorts of knowledge. they knew on the one hand that, under certain conditions, the moon would pass between the earth and the sun (that if a was true, then b would be true) and they knew, on the other hand, that those conditions, a, were fulfilled. consequently they knew in advance what soon became a historical fact, that (unless something had been left out of their calculations) the eclipse must occur, and that b would be true. contrast this with our economic predictions. we are now going through an economic eclipse which began in september, 1929. but few if any economists predicted it, or, if so, they failed to make their predictions public. economics will be more of a science when we can predict depressions. yet we have the comfort of knowing that there are physical sciences like meteorology which are not yet able to make very good predictions. while the astronomers could tell with precision and a century ahead of time when the moon would obscure the sun the meteorologist could not tell, even approximately and even a day ahead of time, whether or not some cloud would obscure both. so it turned out that while the japanese coming to maine saw the moon eclipse the sun, the californians a few miles away only saw an unpredicted cloud eclipse the eclipse. it was because practically all the would be economic forecasters have for the last four years failed dismally to tell the business man what to expect that a business man has stepped forward to finance the econometric society in the hope that out of it might grow scientific prediction. he has also organized a statistical laboratory where he is trying to make use of the most promising methods. he has a paper to present here at a joint session of the statistical association and the econometric society on some of the failures of recent economic predictions. it is well that we face these failures and that, when we fail, we confess it with due humility. i confess it. it is true that in september, 1929, i publicly stated my belief that we were"" then at the top of the stock market"" and that there would be a recession, this forecast being largely on the strength of the elaborate correlation work. and this proved true. but unfortunately i also stated my belief that the recession would be slight and short; and this proved untrue. i can now see that my failure was due to insufficient knowledge of both kinds; scientific and historical. i did not then know certain scientific laws of depressions and i did not know, as well as i should, the historical background of conditions. for instance, i had counted on the continuance of the open market policy of the federal reserve bank of new york, not knowing that these had largely died with governor strong the year before. as to the laws governing depressions, i did not then know, what since i have learned and embodied in my book, booms and depressions, the important r61e of over indebtedness and its tendency to break down the price level through distress selling, contraction of deposit currency, and slackening of its velocity. had i had these two sorts of knowledge in 1929, even to the modest extent which i can now claim to have them, that is, if i had had more correct and complete historical information on the one hand, and more correct and complete knowledge of some of the scientific laws involved on the other, my failure to predict this economic eclipse would at least have been lessened. but even if we had had all the foresight which"" hindsight"" and scientific studies have since brought, we could still only have made a general and largely qualitative rather than a specific and really quantitative prediction. moreover there are always unforeseen circumstances. any prediction, even in astronomy, must always be subject to the reservation that"" other things remain equal"" or nearly so. we economists can, i assume, never hope to rival astronomical predictions of eclipses . we shall be lucky if we can ever rival meteorological predictions of cloudiness. yet there is no reason to despair of forecasting depressions and quantitatively to some extent. the sessions of the statistical association this year are very largely devoted to studies of this depression problem. they should help lay a basis for further and progressively successful studies of the nature of depressions, which studies should ultimately bear fruit in successful forecasting. but such an outcome will not eventuate from such merely a priori studies as characterized the austrian school, nor from such merely descriptive studies as characterized the historical school, nor even from the grinding out of correlation coefficients between statistical series whose inner relationships are unknown or possibly non existent. empiricism will be as disappointing as all the other methodologies which we are quietly relegating to the scrap heap. we need a rational element along with the empirical. astronomers could never have predicted eclipses by means of correlation coefficients. correlation coefficients are seldom used in astronomy although the statistical material available for such calculations is vastly greater than in economic science. the reason is that usually better and more fundamental relationships are available than the mere linear relationships obtainable by the correlation method. such relationships are necessarily superficial, whether in astronomy or economics, and must ultimately give place to something less superficial. no astronomer would think of taking the raw statistical data which his telescope discloses, consisting of innumerable angular measurements, and simply throwing them into the hopper of a correlation machine. if he did, the hodge podge which would come out he would never dream of calling science. and i fear much of the economists' and statisticians' calculations with correlation coefficients will not get us very far. they may be a good stop gap or make shift while we are deciphering the true rational relationships. the distinction between shallow statistical empiricism and a rational statistical analysis is well illustrated by contrasting the earlier treatment of workmen's budgets and the recent use of the same data, now editor of econometrica. the budget data of workmen used to be put merely in the form of percentages spent on food, clothing, rent, fuel, lighting, etc. the most interesting result was the so called ""engel's law"" that the bigger the income, the smaller percentage of it spent on food. the fact that economists had the temerity to call this empirical generalization a ""law"" is itself a reflection on economics as a science. a few of us have tried, on the other hand, to use these percentages together with data. on the cost of living as a means of calculating statistically the demand curves and marginal utility curves which, according to economic theory, must underlie and determine the workman's choices of food, clothing and so on, resulting in the budgetary and price phenomena. of two available methods of tracing our way back from the budgetary phenomena to the fundamental law of demand, that is the most practical. his actual statistical results are as yet preliminary and may well be found inaccurate. but as to method, his work is a model of what statistics should be in the service of economic science. thus may we give a place, in statistics, even for such fundamental, though highly theoretical concepts as that of marginal utility. the shadowy ideas of the austrian school can then be turned into statistical results through a proper method. in this method certain equations of pure theory playa role; and, without these, the mere statistics will tell us next to nothing. among these essential relations the simplest is the well known theorem that the marginal utility of, say, food is equal to the marginal utility of money multiplied by the price of food. only by such scientific methodology can the statistician get beneath the surface of such empiricism as an ""engel's law,"" down to a statistical evaluation of a demand or utility curve. the early astronomers had their analogue of engel's law. it was called bode's law, expressing the relative successive distances of the planets from the sun. today, no astronomer would think of bode's so called law as anything more than a rough description or empirical rule. it is not a law comparable with newton's laws of motion or of gravitation or kepler's laws of planetary motion. we can never fulfil statistically those relations found in fundamental economic theory, if we make no use of those fundamental relations in our manipulation of the raw statistical data, any more than an astronomer could compute the orbit of a planet from the fullest data as to angular measurements afforded by his telescope, without using the relation that the planet is attracted by the sun inversely as the square of the distance. in both cases, theory and fact must go hand in hand. otherwise the world of observation and statistical data will be almost meaningless for lack of any rational framework to fit into; and conversely our theory will be almost meaningless for lack of any statistical expression or verification. we should then have two separate realms of study r a barren set of statistical observations and a barren set of high spun theories, corresponding to the historical and austrian schools. six years ago professor in his address as president of the economic association spoke of the fact that a quantitative analysis was not only different from a theoretical analysis but was found to deal with a different set of concepts. doubtless that is true in economic statistics. but it ought not to be. as long as it is true we cannot boast of being very scientific. other illustrations could be given. the evaluation of the velocity of circulation of money is an example. we talk about it in our courses on economic theory, and used to say it could never be estimated. but it is possible to show that the total circulation of actual physical money in the course of a year is equal to the money deposited in the banks during the year plus the payrolls of the year, plus a number of other but, insignificant items. this total circulation divided by the money in circulation is the velocity of circulation. and from this relationship, together with the requisite statistical data, we can derive, not by empirical correlations but by virtue of the rational theory involved, the statistical result that the velocity of circulation of money in the united states is about twenty five times a year. now that so many able young men, fresh from training in the methods of physical sciences and mathematics, are entering the field of economics and statistics we may expect a gradual disappearance of rank empiricism and arm chair theory alike and a progressive substitution of a rational scientific method for connecting fact and theory. we shall then know our phenomena that a is true. we shall know, both by a priori reasoning and by a posteriori testing, our laws that if a is true, then b must also be true. and finally, from these two sorts of knowledge namely knowledge of the historical fact that a is true and knowledge of the scientific law that if a is true, then b is true we can predict in advance that b will be true. to many all this may seem something new in economics; but it is only an application of something very old in those sciences in whose footsteps we must follow if we are ever to take our place among them as should be our aim and our right. and as economics does take its rightful place as a science with laws verified by facts and capable of predicting, in some degree, economists will have the satisfaction of feeling that sound economic theory has practical applications, that hadley's criticisms have been met and that the business man and the statesmen are justified in seeking our advice as they seek advice in other fields of science. both of these groups of men of affairs are anxious to get quantitative knowledge, to be able to weigh and measure. they need econometrics. in its absence their accountants are fast developing their own methods with a theoretical basis of their own. incidentally, one of our tasks, already undertaken by professor canning, is to connect these results of practical experience in accountancy with economic theory. in short, what we need in economics, or that branch of economics which we now call economic theory, is more of the old, old method which made astronomy, physics, chemistry, and, recently, biology into true sciences. that goal, as i interpret the rising generation of students of ""economic theory,"" is where they are tending. moreover they know where they are going. and they are on their way.",287,21.5540069686411,4.82541222114452,0.244746201099256,6186,1514,16.8551509815916,11.8551509815916,25,-0.0535607986108209,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1933.10502629"

Rice","1908-1939","statistics began as the data of statecraft. statistical connoted political or governmental. these connotations have never been wholly lost, and recent events have revived and strengthened them. statistical method has been adopted in wider and wider areas of inquiry, but government of late has extended its domain with even greater rapidity. to maintain a growing jurisdiction over the affairs of life, government will be increasingly dependent upon more and more better statistics. please note an axiomatic assumption behind this statement : statistical method and statistical data are never ends in themselves. they are always accessory to some purpose of control. we should then seek to catch the drift of events, to appraise the changing social issues, if we, as statisticians, are to foresee and understand the tasks to be imposed upon us. the issues and events of the present may be summed up in the term, the new deal. i think it was walter lippmann who pointed out the antithesis between the new deal and recovery. the distinction seems valid, but i am using the first of these terms in a very inclusive sense which comprises much, at least, of the second. we are actually in the process of getting a good deal of both. ideals often fade before the realities of human nature, economic law and social pressure. we are facing fundamental changes in the social order. laissez faire, in my opinion, is dead forever; on the single condition that society does not re lapse to simpler forms of organization, with drastically lowered population and living standards. this is the real alternative to planning. the new deal represents an attempt to preserve the complexities and hence the standards of our civilization by social control of an economic mechanism that is no longer self operating. some of the present experiment. i am voicing, of course, no views but my own. the new deal is more than idealism. as the president so frankly has said, undoubtedly will fail. the precise forms of future organization are not now visible. but we cannot turn back and i am sure that statistics will be essential in finding the way forward. the era of social control will rest upon factual information about economic and social structures and processes. the parallel between the present period and that of the great war is often noted. our energies were then gathered together for armed conflict. after much initial fumbling, the dependence of national mobilization upon statistical information became apparent. soon, statisticians were everywhere behind the scenes, trying to measure man power, industrial capacity, and the movements of credit and goods. we benefit today from that experience. the period of fumbling has been shortened because the initial tasks resemble those of 1918 and 1919. but the longer term objectives differ widely from those of the war. for one thing, we dont look forward to demobilization. with respect to the long term program we are only catching our stride. the highland low pressure centers in washington symbolize this contrast. the vast structures sprawling over the mall near the potomac, the cerebral ganglia of national effort in war days, are now relatively somnolent in the hum drum of departmental routine. to the east and north in the departments of commerce, treasury, interior, labor and agriculture, and in the agencies of alphabetical combination and permutation, one finds the seething, innovative activity characterizing this unprecedented administration. the new alphabetocracy sometimes reminds me of the smiths!, a neighbor family of my youth: in the haste and turmoil of procreation, the selection of given names for the newest offspring presented a problem beyond the resources of time and attention available to the head of the house and his worthy spouse. in the emergency went only so far as to devise for the infant a new combination of initials. was launched upon his world of playmates with deferred but unlimited responsibility for making these letters mean whatsoever he chose. i might pause for a moment to divulge (in strict confidence) a prestige getting device, much employed in washington conversation. the trick consists of using new initials glibly, with an air of long familiarity. this suggests the possession of inside information, before its release to the public. no one remembers the precise initials you mentioned when the next agency is announced; and even if he does you can always say that existing copyrights had compelled an alteration. being a philadelphian before a washingtonian, i must confess certain handicaps in playing the industrial era was built upon natural science. game of initials. i never say without thinking of a system of transportation; will ever suggest a stimulating drink; and reminds me of items on my list for the drug store. but i must revert to my theme. economy was everywhere taking its toll of statistical services. the year has ended in the midst of a flowering of statistical enterprises, aided by the civil works administrations employment program, the like of which this country has never before seen. in helping to bring about this change of outlook, the statistical association has played an honorable ro1e. on many occasions during its lifetime of nearly a century it has accepted semi official responsibilities regarding governmental statistics. in the past nine months this tradition has been broadened and strengthened. jointly with the social science research council, and at the invitation of the secretaries of the interior, agriculture, commerce and labor, it established in washington an advisory agency known as the committee on government statistics and information services. this has provided a channel through which the technical assistance of our organization has been available to agencies of government. affiliated with it, through interlocking memberships and staff assignments, have been the advisory committee to the secretary of labor, appointed at her request by the president of the association, the joint advisory committee on the census, and a number of other representative agencies with specialized statistical functions. the committee on government statistics was designated by the president in his executive order as one of the seven appointing agencies initially called upon to establish the central statistical board. this is not the place to review in detail the activities carried on by these agencies in the associations behalf. the appropriate reports will be received in business sessions. suffice it to mention that the personal, working services of no less than thirty of our members have been engaged by the first two committees mentioned, and that consideration has been given to statistical or informational problems in no less than eleven departments and independent governmental agencies. many of these problems require wider attention. they cannot be settled, by investigation and report, within allotted periods of time, by a small number of committeemen and staff. they demand the give and take of discussion in an annual meeting. this is the underlying purpose of the program opened here today. we are met in committee of the whole. we seek to mobilize the information, the skill, and the talent of our entire professional association for an appraisal of the statistical requirements of our economic and social situation. the prospect for statistics last spring appeared dark. i shall venture to discuss some of the statistical enterprises and some of the statistical opportunities and responsibilities related to those problems which seem to me of major importance. by explicit arrangement or logical necessity, all of these questions in some form or other are certain to be given further attention in some one or more of our sessions. preparation of base maps for the united states. the fact is little known that the geographical units to which enumerations of census type relate are often unmapped and inexactly described. an county was recently photographed and mapped from the air at a cost of $25,000. as a result, tax revenues obtained in one year from newly discovered real property, hitherto untaxed and officially unknown, more than paid for the cost of the survey. more exact information concerning farm acreage and the boundaries of minor civil divisions is essential to the agricultural adjustment program. the construction of base maps, therefore, has be come a primary statistical requisite. the united states geological survey has initiated with civil works funds an air photography and map ping program designed to serve census and agricultural adjustment needs. the complete program should entail four years of work and the expenditure of some sixteen million dollars. related civil works projects of the bureau of the census will check its descriptions of minor civil divisions against local records, and establish their boundaries. there wid1 still re main some thousands of unincorporated villages, the boundaries of which should be established for enumeration purposes. this would permit a more accurate segregation than is now possible of the urban, village and strictly rural populations. standardization of statistical reporting areas. the n. r. a. has drawn attention conspicuously to the fact that population, industry and trade no longer fall in patterns corresponding to political boundaries. wage scales in the retail code depend upon the population of trading areas. but what are they? how do they relate to industrial areas, census tracts to metropolitan districts? other codes of the establish regional differentials, but what is the criterion of a region, apart from an arbitrary list of states? none of these units is legally defined or even legally recognized, but all attest that political divisions no longer suffice for many social and economic purposes. standardized reporting areas for specific purposes need to be established throughout the united states. these should be of small size to permit ready combination, as in the case of census tracts. the statistical tasks here involved are not merely those of definition, but extend also to the development for these new units of social and economic indexes which will have practicality and significance. time will permit work in especially critical areas. a census of population. a population census in 1934 is imperative. so great have been the movements since 1930 that no one can guess with assurance what the present distribution of population may be. official federal estimates for states and local communities must be abandoned. local birth and death rates, based upon these estimates are already seriously in error. any program of revival for the lagging construction industries must have knowledge of needs in terms of population. do urban vacancies result from doubling up or from actual emigration? what are the urban markets for agricultural production? the rural markets for manufactured products? how are federal funds for public works and for relief to be equitably allocated? such questions can only be answered satisfactorily by a new census. a population census, conjoined with the regular quinquennial census of agriculture, is advocated by this association, through action taken a year ago at cincinnati. it has been endorsed by a large number of competent specialists, by the sociological society, the advisory committee to the census, the social statistics committee of the social science research council, the population association of america, and the bureau of the census itself. in the opinion of the bureau, the date should be set at november 15, 1934. congressional authorization and congressional appropriations will both, apparently, be necessary if the need is to be met. i earnestly hope that this association will not flag in its support of the necessary action. measurement of population dynamics. proposals discussed by the federal government to transplant populations on a large scale from sub marginal areas call attention as never before to the importance of internal mobility. this is a phenomenon of comparatively recent growth at least on its present scale. the concepts and methods employed in enumerations of inhabitants originated at a time when population was relatively fixed in its habitations. enumerations in the past have not given indications of movements. the bureau of the census proposes to ask each person counted in the projected census of 1934, where did you live on april 1,1930? the problem of tabulation involved in summarizing the intervening migrations will be difficult but not insolvable. inventories of structures and real property. the preceding proposals contemplate inventories of geographical area and its subdivisions, and of population, its distribution and movements. we next come to the use made of the land. the census of agriculture to be taken twelve months hence will show the farm uses. for the first time, a comprehensive inventory of real property is going forward in sixty three cities, under the direction of the bureaus of foreign and domestic commerce and the census, with funds provided by the civil works administration. more intensive data relating, for example, to the private burdens of mortgage liens and the public burdens of delinquent taxes will be pro cured for a sample of the universe examined. the way has been pre pared by local studies in cleveland, st. louis and one or two other cities. similar surveys in farm areas and villages are in process by the department of agriculture and the subsistence homesteads unit of the department of the interior. i suggest that these surveys lead to and be supplemented by a general census of structures in connection with the census of agriculture and population projected for november 15, 1934. inventories of economic activity. what are the processes of making a livelihood, engaged in by the people who live and work in the structures, erected upon the land? are we to seek a balanced production of commodities by some system of quotas adjusted through a central administrative control? i assume this to be an essential aspect of (economic planning) whatever else that term may mean. this seems to me the ultimate direction toward which self government in industry under the is looking, although the control of production within a single industry, as a practical program, is sufficiently staggering to the imagination. in any event we face the immediate question, not lacking in acrimonious discussion : what statistics are to be collected under codes, and by whom? the labor data seem to me to be the simpler part of the problem. the requirements for data concerning consumption of materials, production, productive capacity, costs and prices offer greater difficulties. but these must be cleared away if the new deal for industry is to succeed. many gaps in our statistical picture now exist and will remain. but for 1933 and 1934, the census of agriculture, the census of manufactures and the census of business (which includes distribution and service industries) should together provide a comprehensive statistical view of a substantial part of that picture. all of these inquiries are now under way or in preparation. it is hoped that the census of manufactures, once decennial, then quinquennial, now biennial, should in 1934 be come a simplified annual inquiry with appropriate elaboration at quinquennial intervals. with this annual stock taking of manufacturing activity must be synchronized (if they are to survive) the monthly and quarterly industrial inquiries, some seventy in number; and these in turn must be revised, report by report, to adapt them in classification, cover age and content to the requirements of industries operating under n. r. a. codes. similar problems pertain to the fields of mining, electrical industries and probably to transportation. but suppose that jack, who built the house upon the land, had a job and lost it? how many millions of unemployed jacks and marls there are we do not know. hence the proposal to include a census of unemployment with the census of population next november. hence, also, the civil works project directed by the bureau of labor statistics designed to develop improved methods of taking an unemployment census and of estimating unemployment in the future by using the census as a bench mark. statistics of wages, man hours, budgets and costs of living likewise present their respective problems, as thick as cherries on a well loaded tree. we enter ground that is common to the sociologist and economist, as well as to the labor statistician. inquiries in these fields by the bureau of labor statistics, the bureau of home economics and the consumers advisory board of, some of them cooperatively directed by these agencies, are developing new indexes of wide importance to wage earners and consumers. price data seem to me of particular importance. if, as we have been told, administrative policy contemplates the restoration of the dollar to its 1926 value a level which can only be established in terms of prices for commodities and services then price statistics must provide a key stone for the economic arch or, at least, for a very noble experiment in economic control. the relation of price statistics to the administration of n. r. a. codes needs only to be mentioned for its importance in this further direction to be conceded. at one end of the scale are the admirable reports of the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency. in the center, reports may be fair (monthly automobile financing, for example); while at the other end of the scale, where it disappears in a sociological morass of personal finance companies and chattel loans, data are practically non existent. but even at the respectable end of the range, problems emerge. the economist may query: is it possible to determine the flow of funds into capital investment as distinct from consumption goods? the answer to the question seems though its importance all would admit. the sociologist may ask: is it possible to classify bank accounts in such ways as to identify deposits, withdrawals and hoarders by social status? again the answer is negative, though such information would be of obvious value in planning our banking and taxation systems and in stemming the tide at times of financial stress. these are only a few of the harassing questions of economic statistics with which we seem called upon to wrestle. statistical organization and coordination. the solution of problems of this type is a sine qua non of the successful attack upon all or nearly all of the others. there are four major problems of relationship to be solved: banking and credit statistics are of varied development. first, the coordination of statistical activities among the regul.ar establishments of the federal government. second, adjustments of function between these, on the one hand, and the emergency organizations on the other. third, the allocation of functions between the federal government and the states. fourth, the clarification of statistical responsibilities between agencies of government and industrial and trade organizations. these problems crisscross and overlap in most perplexing ways. does the bureau of the census reach an agreement with a trade association for the collection of statistics under a code? it discovers that it has overlooked the effect this will have on the collection of employment data by the bureau of labor statistics. does the bureau of labor statistics arrange a plan with n. r. a. for reports on payrolls? it is recalled be fore too late that state bureaus of labor may be disadvantageously affected. the archaic calendar, and the problem of adjusting reporting periods, introduce other difficulties. there is comparatively little outright duplication of statistical collections, but much need of coordination. the civil works project of the census bureau calling for the establishment of a central card index of business establishments, involving a reconciliation of industrial and trade classifications, should, if carried to completion, be of inestimable value in this respect. proposals to centralize all statistical work in one agency fail to consider that statistics often serve administrative needs, and that statistical competency consists by more than half in familiarity with the data assembled. coordination, and not centralization of statistical collection and analysis, is the function of the central statistical board. established under the emergency powers granted to the president by this agency upon which so many statistical hopes are pinned, must come to an end with the expiration of the recovery act unless congressional action is secured to make it permanent. secure such legislation is of the highest importance for governmental efficiency, for planning and for the interests in general of statisticians. in all of this activity there are grave dangers as well as opportunities. utilizing my insider vantage point of observation at Washington for personal advantage, i am contemplating a corner on accessible supplies of door bells, door knobs and rolling pins. i estimate that replacements on these domestic articles will be high during the next few months if all of the field inquiries recently discussed should be undertaken. my agents will solicit your stock subscriptions at the close of the meeting, for i feel you are entitled to get in on the ground floor. seriously, we are threatened with a plethora of uncoordinated, inaccurate and undigested investigations that, unless harnessed, related and controlled, can only result in statistical chaos. innumerable states and cities, in possession of civil works funds, have been proposing to undertake everything from censuses of population to measurements of changing waist lines among the leisured classes. i trust that before these words are printed a general method of procuring coordination and control of such enterprises will have been devised. non political status for statistical work. there is a notice i should like to write large, and nail to the doors of edifices which i need not mention. it would read : “ politicians keep your hands off scientific services. i can see no difference in principle between the expatriation of germanys most distinguished citizen, albert einstein, because he is a jew, and requirements that appointees to positions in government statistical offices must be democrats or republicans. the close relationship between government and statistics to which i called attention in my opening words makes this a hard, and some would say an impractical, saying. i do not believe its ultimate acceptance to be impossible, with the development if we are so fortunate of higher standards of public administration. organization of the statistical association. having proposed improvements in almost every other direction, i come at last to our own society. it is fortunate indeed that the plan of organization resulting from the indefatigable efforts of your distinguished nominee for association president in 1934 should have been accepted and put in operation before the demands of the new deal came upon us. thanks to our loyal and competent secretary, we are efficiently organized. to my mind there remains an outstanding element of weakness. this concerns the relations of the chapters and the association. the former in some cases are semi independent; in others they are in effective nurslings of the parent body. a strong national organization should rest upon strong and numerous local chapters, to which it is integrally related. to bring this about, in my judgment, requires an acceptance by the chapters of public responsibilities for the preservation and development of statistics in their states and communities, analogous to those of the association in the national sphere; and analogous, further, to the responsibilities assumed by bar associations, medical associations and engineering societies in their respective fields of interest. in a national statistical program the importance of developing the statistical association and its constituent parts can scarcely be over looked. there has been much speculation about the future of our organization. its close identification of interests with the field of economics, and the wide adoption of statistical methods in this and other fields, has led in some quarters to a belief that the statistical association is destined to an early, quiet and inconspicuous demise. i am not among these. i believe, on the contrary, that the secret of life and growth is activity. does hard work remain for which we have specialized competence? i trust that i have indicated the answers. statisticians will have work to do through an organized association of their own so long as determination to grapple with the problems of collective living survives. or has our task been completed? may the committee of the whole now proceed with its tasks!

Mills","1908-1939","it is now almost three hundred years since thomas hobbes dissected the problems of political living and examined the nature of sovereignty, of liberty and of law. it is just twenty years since graham wallas explored the conditions of social life in an integrated world order. the leviathan of thomas hobbes and the great society of graham wallas were alike in that they were organizations of men forced by the compulsion of external events to master the difficult arts of mass living, or to slip backward into civil strife and social confusion. but these arts were to be mastered, in the two cases, under radically different conditions. two hundred and sixty years had brought a transformation in the ways in which men made their living, and in the relations among men that grew out of their economic activities. the scope of mass life had been enormously expanded, in this interval, and the character of private and of social activities had been revolutionized. the years which have passed since graham wallas wrote have intensified older difficulties and have brought new and baffling complexities into social existence. the world order as wallas knew it in 1914 has been profoundly modified. its apparent stability has been shattered. war and resurgent nationalism have effaced the gains of generations in the arts of collective living. on the positive side, the change in the physical circumstances of life has proceeded at a high tempo. new elements have been conquered. greater mastery has been won over the basic processes of production. industrialization has proceeded on a world front. the machine and a far reaching division of labor have created a host of new relations among men, and have tied more tightly together the elements of the social system. to the old problems of social life have been added those due to the emergence of an industrialized leviathan. this artificial monster which, in its maturity, is the distinctive product of our times is at once a social organization and an economic structure. and the nature of this system its working characteristics, its structural defects, its operating limitations passes the comprehension of its human parts. this fact lies at the heart of our present economic confusion. it points the fundamental issue of contemporary life. today we face the imperative question whether man can learn to think and act in a new dimension, largely alien to his inherited nature the dimension opened by mass living. this state of affairs, and the dilemmas to which it gives rise, will, i think, persist. the tendencies that have worked toward the industrialization of contemporary life make for non recurring changes. the static economic relations and the semi periodic fluctuations 'that have received major emphasis in economic literature are perhaps of less importance, viewed in long perspective, than are the persistent forces leading to permanent alterations in the conditions of economic life. the changes which have already occurred, then, are not to be looked upon as of the nature of rare mutations, to which we may slowly adapt ourselves. the compulsion of enduring change will continue to alter the structure of economic and of social life, and the task of adaptation will persist, in ever changing but ever pressing forms. my primary concern tonight is with the problem of coordination and direction that is faced in a closely knit industrial society. in some manner smooth working relations must be established among the elements of such a society. the conflicting interests of individuals must be reconciled. the whole must be directed toward socially desirable objectives. the science of statistics and the art of statistical practice have a major role to play in the solution of this problem, in any form of economic organization. they have a role of exceptional importance under existing conditions. this role is that of providing an economic and social intelligence service adequate to our present needs a reporting system touching every part of the complex structure of organized life. problems of rare difficulty arise here. for we appear to stand today at a transitional stage in human development. the manifold social adjustments and economic adaptations that were achieved without design in the relatively recent past must, in increasing degree, be effected through deliberate, conscious effort. when we could believe that social cement for human kind is of essentially the same type as that which binds the social insects together, there was no necessity that any person or group should seek to define the attributes of social and economic systems, as working entities. the whole functioned independently of any possible social purpose on the part of its elements. how valid this concept may have been in the 18th and 19th centuries i do not venture to say. certainly it is no longer valid today. unfolding circumstance forces us to do consciously what may once have been achieved unconsciously. leviathan must develop a central nervous system. these ideas are familiar enough. i have ventured to present them because of their immediate bearing upon the obligations and responsibilities of the group assembled here tonight, in particular, the obligations and responsibilities of the statistician. in the mathematical refinement of his tools the statistician may seem, at times, to be a student of esoteric cults. he takes many forms and appears to the world of men in strange guises. in his social science incarnation, however, the statistician must remain as noah webster long since defined him one versed in classified facts respecting the condition of the people in a state. his is the task of planning, administering and interpreting the intelligence services essential to the working of the great society of today. i should far exceed the time at my disposal were i to attempt to outline a plan for a system of reporting services adapted to the needs of a modern industrial society. indeed, for the undertaking of such a task, i should require far more knowledge and somewhat more presumption than i now possess. it is perhaps in order, however, to suggest some of the necessary characteristics of such a system. by an economic intelligence service, and here i restrict myself to the economic realm, i mean a system of reporting designed to provide information concerning the working of the financial, productive and distributive systems, in all their parts and in all their inter relations. precisely what information is required at a given time depends upon the stage of industrial development attained, the relative place of competition, of private monopoly and of direct state activity and control, and, not least, upon the character of the questions we have the wit to ask. changing questions and changing combinations of the elements of competition, monopoly and control will give rise to varying needs at different times. in a competitive regime information is needed for the intelligent conduct of economic activity by the participants in processes of production and exchange. the appraisals and the decisions necessary to the maintenance of perfect markets or the approximations to such ideal states that may be realized in an imperfect world are possible only on the basis of full knowledge. when the bloom of free competition passes, when there arise barriers, restrictions and limitations upon the play of free choice, new and supremely important tasks fall upon the informational services. they must provide the factual materials upon which control and regulation must be based. for departure from a fully competitive system means that the mutual adjustment of working parte and the maintenance of a working balance among economic elements becomes more and more a matter of design and conscious action, less and less a matter of happy and unpremeditated conjuncture. finally, and this is true under any system, informational services are necessary to provide detached observers with the data required for scientific analysis and appraisal. in an economy partly free and partly controlled, of the type to which our present system conforms, the statistical services must meet a wide variety of needs. over large areas of economic life we shall have continuing need of the innumerable unplanned adjustments that are effected through the activities of private enterprise. a steady flow of timely, accurate information concerning all the processes of an industrial economy should be available to the agents of such enterprise. the same flow of intelligence is needed by public authorities charged with responsibility for specific phases of regulation, and by those administrators and analysts who are concerned with the working of the economic system as a whole. under existing conditions, moreover, adequate statistical information is necessary for the protection of the public. for regulation inevitably vests some of the attributes of monopoly in the industries regulated. when competition is limited, only full knowledge on the part of the public and its representatives will protect the consumer against exploitation. the creation and the administration of an intelligence service designed to meet these diverse needs in an industrialized economy operating under conditions of partial control is a major task before social scientists today. in stressing the importance of this task i mean to make no plea for fact gathering in the abstract, nor to enter that ancient controversy between inductive and deductive schools. i am concerned with more immediate problems and more specific urgencies. we have a system that is out of hand because we do not understand how it works. neither academic economist nor public officer really knows what are the vital elements. we must blunder, by trial and error, in seeking to perform those directional services that have become necessary under existing conditions. we lack the organized procedures on which such services must be built. we have, of course, beginnings, and good beginnings, in the informational systems provided today by public and private agencies, but our needs have outstripped our resources. major deficiencies have been revealed under the stresses of the last five years. these are, in part, deficiencies in the scope and content of existing reporting services. there are major gaps in our knowledge of the present industrial structure and of current industrial processes. but these gaps, it is fair to say, are being steadily reduced. a number of efficient agencies, federal, state and private, have already laid the foundations of a comprehensive reporting system. such a system will provide basic information, compiled annually or biennially, concerning our productive and distributive plant and its capital structure. supplementing this, we shall have more timely reports covering, completely, the flow of goods and purchasing power and the current utilization of productive resources. our task here is to expand and extend existing services, to fill major vacancies and to reduce the margins of error present in many of the estimates now released. more important, perhaps, than defects of coverage are deficiencies in respect of the correlative character of the materials now provided by our statistical services. we do not have today that full and perfect comparability of records of capital investment, employment, production, stocks, prices, profits, and wage, dividend and interest disbursements that is necessary to the intelligent appraisal of economic conditions. uniform accounting, uniform modes of industrial classification, uniformities in reporting procedures and the other uniformities essential to full comparability may never be achieved, but we must go much further in this direction than we have gone. i have said that the creation of a system of reporting services is no task of mere data gathering. more important, in the last analysis, is the development of an adequate technique of interpretation and use. for statistics are gathered and interpreted within a framework of ideas, guiding principles, standards and concepts, some consciously defined and objective, some unformulated but none the less real. the character of these underlying principles is a matter of direct concern to the statistician. he has a responsibility for the critical appraisal of the concepts current at any time. he is under obligation to contribute to the formulation of suitable objectives and the development of valid principles of interpretation. these considerations have brought us to questions of personnel. it is probably inevitable that the powers and functions of the public services should expand, that the demands upon these services should steadily increase. deeply moving currents of change have shaped our development in the direction of large aggregates, of closely integrated economic organizations, and these forces will not be reversed. such mass living means a burden of public services. for responsibility in the creation and maintenance of essential intelligence services is a public responsibility. the personnel problem here involved is one of the most urgent before modern democracies. in the days when the working of a bureaucracy touched the lives and activities of the people of the country at but few points, personnel problems in government services were of minor importance. it could be maintained with some justice, perhaps, that no special skills were required for the public service, that any person of average intelligence and training could perform the duties of a public servant. this, of course, has been a major argument of those who support the spoils system. we suffer today from the persistence of this view. our social life, on its economic side, has been made over since the days of andrew jackson. the functions of government have increased many fold, and have been transformed in character, yet the old tradition persists. today a continuing staff of experienced technicians in the departments of government is essential to the operation of the kind of industrial society we have developed. some of the special personnel requirements of the last two years will pass, it is true, but the tendencies of generations will persist. whether we like it or not the working of our social and economic systems will depend, in increasing degree, upon the efficiency of technical bureaus of the federal government. in the face of this situation, and of needs more acute than ever in our past for properly qualified public servants, we find current conditions marked by some highly disturbing features. trained men are finding a place, it is gratifying to note, in the technical organizations of the central government. but this favorable movement on the one flank is balanced, perhaps over balanced, by a reverse movement on the other flank. the traditions of the spoils system have received new impetus and new sanctions in recent months. the ship of the new deal is not manned exclusively by galahads. political considerations control a great mass of appointments. under fairer skies this might be tolerated. it is a form of social suicide today. i would venture a further comment on this matter. it is a notable and important fact that weakness, faulty organization, ineptitude and sheer dishonesty come to no clear head in the working of the public services. although the replacement of experts by political appointees in a technical bureau of government would create a condition of general inefficiency, such inefficiency would be manifest only in diffused and intangible forms. it would probably not lead to a breakdown of social machinery, clearly attributable to recognized elements of inefficiency. nor would the degree of inefficiency be open to accurate measurement. interested persons would be aware of muddling ineptitude, but no sharp signal of breakdown would be given to citizens at large. here lies, i think, a problem we must somehow solve. private enterprise possesses, at least, the touchstone of profit and loss. there may well be wide latitude for incapacity in competitive industry, but, late or soon, red entries must mark the presence of sustained inefficiency. what comparable criterion have we for the public services y can we devise a test which will promptly reveal incapacity in the technical services of government, and measure the degree of incapacity t if we cannot, the great society may well founder upon the rocks of political spoils. i can think. of but one substitute for the rigorous testing of the public services which a social profit and loss account might provide. between the administrators of such services and professional bodies of social scientists there must be kept open a channel for the continuing transmission of advice, criticism, comment and suggestion. there are many reasons why this objective criticism is needed by those engaged in the daily task of collecting and interpreting statistical records. not the least of these arises out of the fact that statistics, in the mass, fall with deadening impact upon the human mind. for statistics, as i need not advise this audience, are really a lethal weapon. a pressing problem facing those in the intelligence services is how to offset this enervating influence, how to maintain a live, alert attitude toward the materials of their trade. a steady inflow of critical opinion offers one means of ensuring such an attitude. but there are other reasons for the maintenance of close and continuing contacts between professional groups and those manning federal and state agencies. i have referred to the need of preserving high standards of integrity in the conduct of these agencies. in the present state of political ethics constant and critical oversight from scientific groups is needed to offset the pressures from other sources, pressures tending to weaken the statistical services of government. again, the body of concepts needed to give direction to data gathering activities and to provide guides to the interpretation of statistical records must be built up, largely, by members of professional groups not actively identified with public administration. unless there is vitality of thought among those concerned with this body of economic and social concepts and unless this vitality is imparted, through direct contact, to those engaged in the administration of the intelligence services, sterility and inertia will be hard to fight off. such sterility and inertia threaten both groups, in the absence of close and constant contacts. the maintenance of these contacts is distinctly a responsibility of the statistical association. its membership cuts across the usual lines of demarcation between the social sciences. the professional interests of its members, in respect of the substance of scientific inquiry, are, in the nature of things, more diverse than are those of other groups of social scientists. administrative and technical problems of data gathering and data utilization are matters of particular concern to its members. experiments over the long history of the association point to useful modes of cooperation between an independent professional society and governmental agencies. my predecessor was instrumental in beginning a new and fruitful chapter in this history of cooperation with public agencies, through the creation of the committee on government statistics and information services. the establishment, on a more permanent basis, of means of effective contact between our association and the informational services of the federal government is a task remaining to us. the great human documents that deal with the problems of organized living have been born, in the main, in periods of turmoil and disorder. plato, writing in an age of political chaos, outlined in the republic an orderly mode of social life. thomas hobbes treatise was described, by himself, as a discourse of civil and ecclesiastical government occasioned by the disorders of the present time. hobbes also, believing that leviathan, generated by reason, might be destroyed at last by civil strife, was searching for the rules and conditions of orderly social living. in this coincidence of social disorder and of the appearance of blue prints of utopia we have a manifestation of a conflict old in human history. on the one side we have an environment marked by flux and ceaseless change a world in which disorder, irregularity, variation and difference are the continuing characteristics of existence. on the other side there is an unremitting pressure for order and security on the part of human kind. there have been periods in our history when fortunate conjunctures allowed reasonable security to populations at large. but the sweep of history has perhaps more frequently brought change, diversity, conflict and disturbance, and with these social disorder and individual insecurity. one of the transient periods when stability and security seemed part of a natural order was enjoyed in the western world for a single generation prior to the great war. so short is our perspective that this brief experience has led many of us to take order and security for granted. we feel that something which is ours, of right, has been taken from us by the disturbances of the last twenty years. but i think it clear, in the inspection of time, that the reemergence in our generation of unsettling change as a dominating factor in the conditions of living is taking us closer than we were in pre war years to a normal state of affairs. in the long span of history nonrecurring change and diversity of motion have dominated human life. we live again, today, in an age marked by the occurrence of lasting modifications in the conditions of existence. this ferment of change comes at a time when the institutions of social life in the western world have become more complex, more ponderous, more extensive in scope and influence than ever before in our history. new forms of mass living have developed. it is primarily in the economic realm that this is true. an industrial leviathan, largely created during the preceding era of historically unwonted stability, is being exposed to a storm of change. this condition makes demands upon the human elements of this organization that are perhaps more pressing than in any earlier age. more insistently, in more compelling form than in the days of the greek cities, or of the english commonwealth, or of the pre war world, these questions call for answers: can men learn to think and act in the dimension opened by mass living? may social order and individual security be won in this dimension? i would emphasize a word i have just used that social order and individual security must be won, must be won anew by each generation. order and security are not our birthrights. it was an easy thing to look to the ""known, natural inclinations of mankind"" for the automatic creation of order, to accept the nice assumption of mandeville that the granting of free play to private vices necessarily brought public benefits. but this was a grievously oversimplified view. individual security must be aggressively won, and social order must be imposed upon our environment. where, then, are we to look for that regularity and order in the circumstances of living which seems to be a necessary condition of rational existence t how are we to achieve economic security in a world of ceaseless movement t i have no answers to these questions. but i have emphasized a necessary first step in any campaign directed toward the attainment of social order today. if we are to avoid that particular and most terrifying kind of chaos that develops when a highly integrated economy gets out of gear, we must develop intelligence services adequate to the needs of an industrialized mode of living. through such services we must acquire the detailed knowledge of the working attributes of our industrial system which we lack today. we need knowledge that will enable the human elements to adapt themselves to the requirements of a mechanized productive organization. we require knowledge far more knowledge than we now have if social control is not to incur hazards of disruption as great as those to which the unregulated system is exposed. nor is this a mere technical task. this vast machine we have created must be directed toward objectives consistent with its own structure and with the human requirements it must serve. there is no assurance in all this that order may be discovered and security born of these efforts. perhaps the task before us exceeds our capacities. it may well be that we are asking more of nature than she will give, when we seek security in a universe of change. it may be that inherent limitations upon the degree of social activity of which man is capable may prevent the setting of social objectives, the coordination of our diverse individual activities and the mastering of the masses of statistics necessary to collective living in an industrial society. if this be so, and in the present state of the world no man may say that it is not, the modern leviathan may go the way of his pre historic predecessors. then, when men again are living in a state of nature, naked, rude and barbarous, some traveler from new zealand, standing on the ruins of the commerce building, may read our epitaph: ""here lies the body of leviathan, dead of locomotor ataxia, complicated by a plethora of indigestible statistics."" yet there is hope of a happier outcome. the disciplines inherent in industrial processes are themselves creating regularities in the working of the industrial system. through adequate intelligence services more of these regularities will be discovered. adaptation to them will lessen the operating frictions out of which social disorder grows. but we must go beyond this. we of this generation must proceed on the assumption that order in economic and social life may be achieved through conscious action, as well as through the compulsion of external events. order, in some degree, is self created. order may be impressed upon the world in which we live. not through blind action may this be done, not with naive disregard of the essential nature of the system which has been built up through generations of cumulative change. over simplification in this direction may be as devastating in its effects as is a blind trusting to private vices to create public benefits. but through informed action, action based upon a knowledge of the system with which we are dealing, we may enforce order in the behavior of that system. through the discovery of inherent regularities, then, and through the deliberate impressing of regularities upon a system we have learned to understand, we may hope to bind leviathan, and to win order and security for our generation. basic in any such program is 'the establishment of a system of intelligence services far superior to anything we possess today, and the development of personnel adequate to the demands of such a system. this is a large order. the activities of the existing public services, alone, will not accomplish these tasks. cloistered study, alone, will not accomplish these tasks. their accomplishment is an obligation of all social scientists, and more particularly, i think, of those who belong to the statistical profession. this obligation will be a first lien upon our energies, in the years immediately before us.",206,21.4271844660194,5.11236973266878,0.277752605346624,4414,1226,17.7736703604155,12.7736703604155,69,0.228862722052386,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1935.10504134"

King","1908-1939","statistics is frequently referred to as one of the youngest of the sciences, and it is undoubtedly true that youth is a characteristic of a large proportion of the complicated technique now employed in dealing with masses of data. this is, however, far from saying that the most elementary principles of statistics are of recent origin. bowley de fines statistics as the science of counting. if we accept this definition, it follows that, among early statisticians, we must certainly include both the clever inca who devised a method of enumerating his llamas by tying knots in his whips, and the keen minded roman who converted a crude system of tallying into a notation which enabled him to compare at a glance the sizes of large numbers. enumeration forms the prime basis for both mathematics and accounting, and without these aids, it is hard to conceive of social organization advancing to any noticeable extent. apparently, therefore, we statisticians cannot be accused of undue boasting if we assert that, to no small degree, civilization rests upon a statistical foundation. it must be admitted, however, that such records as have come down to us seem to indicate that, before the renaissance, statistical work, for the most part was confined mainly to simple enumerations of population or property. there were, however, notable exceptions to this rule. researches conducted by that careful and erudite student of statistical lore, the late edwin w. kopf, indicated that the life tables devised by the vital statisticians of augustus caesars day were practically applied in italy for something like a thousand years. what is even more astounding, he found that, in ancient babylon, our science had made such remarkable progress that life tables were available and were used in writing most of the forms of life insurance in vogue in the united states today. who knows but that while we are celebrating, in 1939, the centenary of the statistical association, and preening ourselves upon the long life of our organization, the cables may carry a message something like the following: archaeologists unearthed today in babylon a remarkable set of clay tablets recording the minutes of the 1242nd annual meeting of the babylonian statistical association. in view of the fact that these achievements of ancient statisticians have for so long been lost in the mists of antiquity, it may well be that other of our supposedly new devices may be nothing more than revivals of procedures, once commonly employed, but now long forgotten. until, however, evidence to this effect is forthcoming, the conclusion seems to be warranted. that until comparatively recent times, statistics, for the most part, consisted merely of more or less complete enumerations of the inhabitants, and especially of the fighting men and resources needed for war purposes. the very name statistician indicates clearly that the original worker in this field was looked upon primarily as a servant of the state. as long as statisticians served mainly in that capacity, the utilitarian nature of their work seemed clear to nearly everyone. when, however, in the seventeenth century, qbrecht, graunt, neumann, and petty began dabbling in records of births and deaths, the practical man of the day probably looked upon these four, much as we now do upon the collectors of the wooden indians, which once stood before cigar stores. when, however, a little later, halley, by aid of their figures, rediscovered the art of making mortality tables and thus established the basis for modern life insurance, it became evident that the work of even these visionaries possessed a high degree of utility. similarly, when mathematicians like pascal, the bernoullis, de moivre, gauss, laplace, cournot, and poisson developed the theory of probability, the chances are that few people believed that this theory could ever be applied to problems relating to everyday life. however, even while the theory was developing, suszmilch, necker, malthus, fuchs, lom bard, quetelet, farr, and many other lesser lights, were showing that such abstract mathematical research was of real importance in solving the social problems of the day. perhaps it was observation of the fact that so many important practical results were being unexpectedly derived from masses of apparently useless data which led lavoisier, writing around 1791, to announce that if only the french national assembly would arrange to collect adequate information concerning agriculture, population, commerce, etc., the resulting report would contain in a small number of pages the entire science of political economy, or rather this would cease to exist; for the results would be so clear, so palpable; the different questions which one could raise would be so easy to resolve, that it would no longer be possible to have any diversity of opinion. antoine lavoisier has long since been gathered to his fathers. for many years, the masses of statistical information for which he prayed have been collected and placed at our beck and call. every decade, for example, our census bureau fills an eight foot shelf with thin leaved volumes closely packed with figures, and from these we can glean information on a thousand topics. much progress has undoubtedly been made in the direction of putting the social sciences upon a firmer foundation. even so, however, if, during the last few days, the shade of lavoisier has happened in at our sessions, it is to be feared that he has been both surprised and grieved to learn that, de spite the numerous statistical tomes at their disposal, some of our most highly trained specialists are not in perfect accord as regards the wisdom of the government spending policy, that others are not in complete harmony on the money question, and that some few even show traces of disagreement concerning the merits of the various phases of the new deal. with our present accumulation of hind sight, lavoisiers faith in the potency of massed figures seems strangely naive. it may well be, however, that, had we lived in lavoisiers day, we too might have felt that, with an adequate supply of data, the truth would inevitably stand clearly revealed. it was only after many decades of experience with masses of data, that statisticians learned that one cannot build the tower of science merely by piling figures upon figures. two generations after lavoisier, the german historical school of economists still exhibited for masses of data a reverence and faith almost as childlike as that of lavoisier. lavoisiers enthusiasm over statistics the new device which seemed so promising is easily comprehensible. the undue persistence of this point of view was, however, unfortunate, for it led to the waste of much energy in the gathering of data which were practically useless when collected. wherever there prevailed this emphasis upon data, rather than upon reasoning, science made but little progress. this does not mean, however, that one is justified in belittling the importance of having adequate statistical bases upon which to build our scientific superstructures. in the united states, we are, indeed fortunate in having available as foundation material our magnificent collections of census data. the student of dynamic economic and social problems should be ever grateful for the statistical abstract and the survey of current business which gather together in extremely convenient form numerous series of comparable annual or monthly figures, which series enable him to interpolate between the census dates and thus measure changing relationships of cause and effect. unfortunately, however, there is one fly in the statisticians ointment. it is that, all too frequently, no coordination exists between the basic census data and the series which must be used for purposes of interpolation. for example, the united states bureau of labor statistics collects various series recording changes in hours worked per week, but one searches the census in vain for corresponding data. similarly, the united states bureau of agricultural economics notes changes in the rates of pay of agricultural workers paid by the month and of others paid by the day, but the census figures do not tell us how many workers were paid in each manner during the census period. on the other hand, the bureau of the census records the number of persons reporting themselves as bookkeepers at the beginning of each decade, but we have no annual index from which to estimate the changes which are occurring from year to year in the size of this group. fortunately, real progress is being made in the direction of coordinating the statistics collected by different federal departments, and many gaps are being filled in. on the whole, we are justified in taking great pride in our splendid collection of basic statistical information, and we should feel it our duty to work for the improvement of these essential figures. at the same time, however, we should remember that collecting basic material is an extremely expensive process, and that, in deciding what additional data are worth while, the interests of the taxpayers, as well as those of the users of statistics, should always be kept in mind. in every instance, the question should be raised: are the figures worth what they cost? there can, for example, be no doubt that we statisticians are served better by having a census of agriculture every five years than by having one every ten years and that it is also to our advantage to have biennial rather than quinquennial or decennial censuses of manufactures. when, however, we consider the great number of year by year and month by month series prepared by the bureau of agricultural economics, by the department of labor, or by the department of commerce, and when we consider further the fact that frequency of enumeration often means a sacrifice in the completeness of each and every enumeration, and hence the disappearance of any really adequate census basis for many series, a question arises as to whether the extra dollars invested by the taxpayers in order to secure frequent enumerations might not be better spent. at present, plans are being completed to make the population census quinquennial rather than decennial. in view of the fact that our association has repeatedly endorsed this move, i realize that to question its advisability may be near treason. it goes without saying that health officers need reasonably accurate bases for use in computing sickness rates. are we sure, however, that, were we to expend on the utilization of existing data one tenth of the cost of a census, it might not prove feasible to approximate closely enough for practical purposes the population of all the larger segments of the united states? can we justify the expenditure of millions of dollars for an additional population census before any serious effort has been made to ascertain whether or not data already available can be made to yield the major part of the information which the census is designed to provide? it is undoubtedly true that statistical science can get nowhere unless it is based upon a broad and firm foundation of accurate data. this foundation needs, however, to be built according to plan, and to have the various sections carefully coordinated. furthermore, in planning the foundation, the matter of cost should always be kept in mind, for cost is as important to the nation as to any private builder. unfortunately, in our own as well as other countries, the rules just laid down have been as frequently overlooked as observed. we have had far too much sporadic and often aimless collection of data. with a faith as childlike as that of antoine lavoisier, congressional commit tees vote for elaborate inquiries without having any clear understanding of what uses can be made of the figures after they have been collected. in some cases, the result is to clutter the archives with cords of dust gathering volumes of figures answering no definite questions and related to none of the major bodies of existing data. at the same time that congress appropriates money for such aimless figure collecting excursions, it hesitates long to furnish the very minor sums needed to pay for publishing important tabulations obtained in connection with the regular decennial census. while congress has often been guilty of fostering the collection of masses of practically useless data, it has remained for the present alphabetocracy to reduce this process to a fine art. to no small extent, this has been the result of considering figure gathering, along with boondoggling, as an ideal form of made work when a lazy minded or unimaginative relief administrator cannot conjure up anything useful for his (white collared proteges to do, he can always set them to counting one thing or another. a favorite task seems to be the impossible one of counting the number of unemployed. perhaps one of the reasons adding materially to the attractiveness of this undertaking is the difficulty of deciding whether the counter himself is or is not unemployed. not only relief, but the general necessities of a modern bureaucracy require figure collecting on a hitherto unheard of scale. formerly, john smith, god and his wife permitting, planted his corn and cotton and sold his hogs and potatoes when and where he pleased. today he must file a detailed report of his past performances (whether actual or constructive depending upon his ethical standards and the prying proclivities of his neighbors), and of the program which he nominally, or perhaps really, intends to follow in the future. handling these re ports provides jobs for an army of statistical clerks and prestige for many a hitherto unknown administrator. and so it is likewise in many other industries, and would be in all were it not for the unhappy tendency of the supreme court to blight the promising careers of so many embryo statisticians and bureaucrats. however, we can all find some solace in the fact that the fledglings of the late, and by some lamented, blue eagle were given a year in which to record statistically the numerous deeds and misdeeds characterizing his brief but colorful existence. at present, we statisticians are likely to find ourselves torn by two conflicting emotions. as breadwinners, we realize that the more figure collecting is done, the stronger is the demand for statisticians and the greater the probability that we can add to our supply of shekels. as scientists, on the other hand, we know that the public in general, and business men in particular, are becoming so annoyed by the growing number of calls for statistical data that they are refusing to furnish to long established governmental agencies such as the bureau of the census, the information needed as a foundation for all our statistical studies. furthermore, as citizens, we cannot overlook the fact that many of the inquiries are costing far more than the results are worth. perhaps we may more readily overcome the urgings of self interest if we pause to consider the fact that increased demand for statistical workers soon generates an increased supply, and that therefore, our monetary gains are likely, at best, to be but short lived. clearly, the national welfare demands an adequate, but not excessive, mass of sound, thoroughly coordinated data as a base line upon which our advances must be founded. the best way to advance from this base line, is by means of studies carefully designed to answer very specific questions. in selecting questions to be answered, we should always consider both the importance of having the question answered and the cost of answering it. to know whether there are eight millions or ten millions of people who call themselves unemployed may be interesting but of slight importance. in either case, the number is vastly too large. the thing which is important is to know why many people are idle and how they can be set to work producing useful goods. perhaps the latter information can be gathered at but a fraction of the cost of the former. during the last quarter century, both governmental and private re search organizations, and also many individual statisticians, have been diligently and successfully engaged in pushing forward important lines of knowledge. up to the last decade, it was commonly assumed that any statistical advance made anywhere would automatically become the gain of all science. perhaps the social science research council was the first body forcefully to call attention to the fact that various individuals and organizations were often completely unaware that others were working along almost identical lines. it remained, however, for the depression year of 1930 to 1932 to bring out vividly the fact that the world at large knew almost nothing of the facts established by statistical research. most of the ancient fallacies which the scientists of a century ago considered they had laid to rest for all time, were resurrected and their ghosts were soon warmly accepted in high circles as being real flesh and blood. apparently in complete ignorance of the facts so clearly established by the painstaking research of men like carl snyder and baker, scaremongers told us that the nation was about to be overwhelmed by a sudden deluge of products from our farms and factories, and that we must, therefore, prepare to maintain in permanent idleness a large proportion of the nations erstwhile working force. others, equally uninformed concerning the work of the brookings institution, the national bureau of economic research, and the national industrial conference board, asserted vehemently that we were suffering from having invested too much of our resources in machinery and equipment and that we were in danger of being crushed by overcapacity for production. while not all of these ghosts have yet been driven back to their graves, it is gratifying to report that marked progress in that direction is clearly visible. perhaps this habit of reviving economic and statistical fallacies is inherent in the depression spirit. however, other sciences do not suffer similarly. the business collapse of 1929 to 1932 did not cause geographers to return to the belief that the world is flat, did not cause biologists to revert to the idea that sickness was the result of witchcraft, did not even revive among chemists the phlogiston theory. the tendency to resurrect long dead fallacies seems to be peculiar to the social science. perhaps this defect is inherent and cannot be remedied, but it seems worthwhile to make some attempt to effect a cure. one thing which the field of statistics obviously lacks is a convenient way of discovering, as regards any given subject, what statistics are available. in other words, we need an adequate bibliography of statistical material. existing bibliographers as a rule, refer merely to whole volumes of figures and tell little or nothing about their contents. there is, for example, no catalogue to which one may turn and learn what statistical material exists which bears upon any particular subject. the research worker often can do no more than grope blindly in the hope that he will stumble onto the figures which he desires. how, for example, can he be expected to know that a study of negroes in industry appears in a monograph prepared by the pennsylvania department of internal affairs, that to h d information concerning distribution of incomes by occupations he had best refer to a report of the new york state tax commission? the lack of such an adequate bibliography of statistical material makes it impossible to avoid repeated duplication of effort. it also retards progress by preventing one statistician from building upon what another has done. the way to advance successfully is to have full coordination of effort not to have each man depending solely upon his own diligence and ingenuity. a well organized catalogue of statistical information would greatly further such coordination. to compile a really helpful bibliography would be a huge under taking, for it would be necessary for the catalogues not only to differentiate source and secondary material but also to distinguish between statistical tables which are the results of years of effort by competent statistical staffs and those which represent nothing more than hasty guesses made by some enthusiastic publicist. the rating of statistical data would seem to be no impossible task but obviously it could only be done successfully by highly trained workers. to obtain such workers would add greatly to the expense of the enterprise. the government could, however, much better afford to spend millions upon a project like this, which would strengthen greatly the foundations underlying all statistical work, than to pay out like sums for the collection of masses of data having at best transitory value. the construction of a great card catalogue citing and relating statistical data would be one way of consolidating the gains made by statistical science. it would be an expensive way, but would probably be worth more than it would cost. fortunately, the preparation of a colossal card catalogue of statistics does not represent the only possible method of consolidating our gains. as previously stated, many statisticians have individually advanced far ahead of the base trenches. they have proceeded by varying routes, and it is therefore hard to visualize the new advanced line which they have attained. their positions need tying together. the most feasible way of doing this seems to be to have competent and unbiased committees of specialists look into the results of the various studies known to exist in a given field, and thus ascertain exactly what facts have been thoroughly established and what lines of investigation need to be pursued further. it is highly probable, for example, that ample statistics are available to settle such questions as the following: 1. the effect of changing income upon the birth rate. 2. the relationship between temperature and sickness rates. 3. the effect of wage rates upon the volume of employment. 4. the interrelationships of money, credit, and prices. 5. the connection between price and wage rigidity and unemployment 6. the effect of length of working time upon production. 7. the causes of depression. nevertheless, it is safe to assert that many skilled statisticians, to say nothing of laymen, are not sufficiently versed in the literature of the subject to distinguish between findings based upon adequate evidence and the mere assertions of ignorant enthusiasts or charlatans. it is hoped that our recently formed committee to appraise the statistical evidence concerning the present depression will blaze a trail which can be followed by similar committees dealing with other subjects. were a series of such committees formed, each to evaluate and consolidate all available evidence relating to the particular subject assigned to the committee, the probabilities are that the results would be extremely beneficial not only to statisticians and social scientists but to the public at large. at present, the crying need is not for more basic data, is not even for more research. what is really important is to enlighten the public in general, and our policy making and administrative officials in particular, concerning facts thoroughly established and well understood by specialists in the various fields of social science. eventually, we hope and indeed fully expect to advance our outposts far beyond their present positions. temporarily the forces of darkness are yielding ground slowly, but they may counter attack. as dr. frederick c. mills pointed out in his presidential address last year, we are inclined to take order and security for granted just as we do air. the truth is, however, that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. since this is the case, the policy which at present is safest is to proceed at once to consolidate our gains

Davis","1908-1939","one evening twenty eight years ago a beloved new england clergy man, rich in humor and wisdom too, put before a harvard group of scholars what he termed a modest he urged the founding of a new graduate school for the retrogressive re education. this evening we are to enjoy addresses from the presidents of societies de voted to the study of statistics, politics, labor legislation, economics, and sociology. fifty years ago such an evening would have been given over to one address perhaps a n hour and a half long; and never before, i believe, have more than three presidential addresses been made at one session. each of tonights addresses will be shortened to twenty minutes; my main duty will be to hold the speakers to their allotted time. perhaps this multiplication of addresses reflects something more than the multiplication of societies since the founding of the statistical association in 1839 and the diversification of specialties during the century that has intervened. these five addresses at one session may indicate that a close cooperation of them and other related societies is at hand and foreshadow the merging of thesis and antithesis into a new synthesis. the older politics, economics, and law, even the sociology made familiar to our youth by herbert spencer, were all based on the individual as the social atom. the politics, economics, and sociology of today are based mainly on the group; perhaps in future law also will find a similar basis and john doe and richard roe lose their places of honor. this change of the unit of study explains why statistics, the numerical study of groups, is preeminent among modern methods of social study, and why accordingly the newer phases of politics and law, economics, and sociology, rely as never before on statistical methods and find therein a higher unity. the nineteenth was once called the statistical century; perhaps in future the same phrase will be applied with greater truth to the twentieth. at least the addresses which you will now hear have whispered this suggestion to one whose major interest for half a century has been in statistics as a method of study in all the social sciences. of doctors of philosophy. at the present rate of advance, he said, it is possible for our universities to turn out fleets of intellectual dreadnaughts whose draught does not allow them to navigate in safety the home waters. in the retrogressive school there will be the opportunity to make the necessary adjustments to the actual situation which under ordinary conditions are more or less painful. the course in comparative literature will be supplemented by a half course in comparative illiteracy. there will be courses on the superficial, the obvious, the hit or miss, the by and large, the topsy turvy, the go as you please, and the other forms in which truth appears to the ordinary intelligence. [the student] will at tend lectures on the heterogeneity of the miscellaneous, the unexpected ness of the inevitable, and the historicity of the contemporaneous. through various kindergarten devices he will be taught ,the great truth embodied in the philosophical maxim, this is a rum world. these few excerpts will perhaps convey dr. crothers idea. though humorously put, it had a serious core that was by no means devoid of merit. his plea did not fall upon deaf ears, but it opened no safe deposit boxes and buttered no professors parsnips. long since it has slumbered forgotten in the files of a defunct magazine. 1 undeterred by the fate of this former proposal, i venture to make another, perhaps less modest and certainly more serious, for the establishment of what i shall call schools of social engineering. for decades our universities have had, alongside departments and schools of the natural sciences, other schools or departments of engineering and medicine. professors of physics, chemistry, and biology are flanked by colleagues who concentrate on applications of natural science to serving mens manifold needs and curing or preventing their diseases, and on training engineers, architects, doctors, and surgeons to practice their professions in transforming a rum world into something less rummy. the progress of pure science, and the contributions of engineering and medicine, have been mutually invaluable. largely as a result, they are revolutionizing our world at marvelous speed, until today there are many who tremble because society can ill adapt itself to so fast a pace of social change. j. m. clark, in his stimulating presidential address last year warned that the world will not give us unlimited time to work out the answer to the crucial question whether our social system can be refashioned so as to use the productive powers so plentifully developed, and to give everyone an opportunity to produce and to earn a living. rightly or wrongly, i interpret him to mean that we social scientists have this pistol at our heads. as a social scientist for better or worse i cannot accept this implication, or fully endorse: the business depression points an accusing finger at professional economist. individually, and as a profession, we have unmistakable shortcomings; but we cannot accept responsibility for the depression or for setting the world right. we have other fish to fry, as clark indeed pointed out; and the more and better fish that we fry are required to nourish a new profession that we can help to breed and mature. i submit that our departments of economics, political science, and sociology should be flanked by departments or schools of social engineering, economic medicine, political architecture. there specialists in solving social problems could be trained and research directed to such practical ends could be carried on. there is room for social engineering workshops to parallel our engineering laboratories. on the educational aspects of my rash proposal, i cannot elaborate here; and if i seem to make bold leaps across yawning voids, it is because i am desperately trying to keep in step with the inexorable march of time. let us, however, frankly recognize the distinction between pure science and its applications, in our field as in others. we do not expect a physicist to build a bridge or a biologist to treat cancer. no more should we, if we are primarily economists, political scientists, or sociologists, set out to be social engineers or social doctors. if our social structure creaks and groans and suffers breakdowns, we should find out what is the matter and why, and we should seek to develop sound principles of social structure; but if we take it upon ourselves to lubricate, repair, remodel, or rebuild this structure, we shall only betray our unfitness for the task. if our acquisitive society is sick, we should analyze the pathological condition and try to develop therapeutic principles; but we ought not to write prescriptions and make bedside visits. if our civilization, as catastrophists assure us, is tottering to its fall, we shall prove pygmies instead of samsons if we undertake to carry lumber to shore it up. if some among us choose to change their profession, let them do so, but do it with their eyes open. the rest of us have indeed a responsibility and an opportunity; but it lies in helping to build up new professions to perform such tasks, instead of amateurishly tackling them ourselves or leaving them to be bungled by quacks outside our ranks. already these professions are beginning to emerge. incidentally and a blast against economists, occasionally, our universities are helping train a few vigorous neophytes. but where, in the field of applied social science, are the counterparts of those who have built our lofty skyscrapers, our magnificent highways, our automobiles and airplanes, our boulder dam, and of those who have well nigh won the campaigns against smallpox, typhoid, and tuberculosis? harnessing the solid tides may be more remote than putting passamaquoddy to work; but surely the arts of building social dikes, bridges, and highways can be mastered no less than the arts of fence fixing and log rolling. these are not mere metaphors; they correspond to concrete realities. there is urgent need of well trained, specialized professionals who will concentrate on specific means of correcting our economic, political, and social defects, thereby transforming this half crazy world into something less topsy turvy. in recent years the word planning has been dinned into our ears. social planning, economic planning, national planning these have been phrases to conjure with. in our midst are devotees, indifferent, and arrant enemies of this new cult, with its amazing conglomeration of doctrines. with applied social science just striving to be born, governments have embarked on large scale social planning. in effect, they have said: go to, let us build a new world. the materials are all here. we have only to set about it with a will. this not the spirit of the scientist or the engineer. we do have the requisite basic materials, and our brain power may be as great today as it will be later; but of the requisite techniques and skills, much must be learned before the more ambitious tasks can be successfully performed. only by degrees have bridges replaced ferry boats of improving type. in the stage that the engineering art had reached fifty years ago, it would have been disastrous to attempt to build the san francisco bay bridge. it is no less disastrous today to attempt to build its social counterparts while the technique of social engineering is in its present stage. in the quasi religion of social planning, however, i see indications of cravings for the services of real social engineers, who will not only plan and execute but bring constructive plans to successful execution, and of social doctors, who will not only prescribe and treat but really cure social ills. in the next fifty years, i make bold to prophesy, the profession of social engineering, under some name or other, will come to rank with those of medicine, law, and engineering; and the development of this profession will prove as fruitful to the progress of social science as developments in engineering and medicine have been to the progress of the natural sciences. to avoid misunderstanding, let me say that by social engineering i do not mean public administration, nor imply that the profession must be or will be practiced only in the government service. on the contrary, i hold that, in democratic societies, its major development will be outside, just as has been true of civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering, medicine, and surgery. time limits forbid me to introduce more academic qualifications or to answer your unspoken objections. if i may say it, with due reverence and respect, god seemed willing and your patience might permit, but it doesnt fit into the planned economy of this session. let me therefore pass, without further ado, to the question: what is the relation between statistics and social engineering? i1 as we all know, statistics is a word of multiple meanings. sometimes it means statistical data, in crude, refined, or elaborated forms. sometimes it means statistical methods, from the more elementary, which all statisticians are supposed to have mastered, to the more re fined, before which many of us are still illiterate.4 sometimes it means the statistical process of solving problems with the aid of statistical data and methods. statistics may or may not be one of the essentials of modern social science. i think it is, though there is place for social scientists who realize that they know nothing of statistics. at all events, statistics is basic to social engineering. perhaps nowhere else, even in business and government, is the proper utilization of statistics more truly vital. representing a statistical association, i can appropriately emphasize this point; but i do so without claiming priority for statistics, or elevating it to a position of unique importance, in the training and practice of the new professions. i do not mean that one must master all known statistical techniques before he can qualify as social engineer or social doctor, any more than a qualified civil engineer must be a ph.d. in physics or a reputable physician a ph.d. in anatomy or physiology. i do mean that a thorough grounding in statistics is no less essential for entrants into these new professions than engineering sciences are for would be engineers and pre medical courses for bud ding doctors; and that statistics must be constantly called into play in the practice of these newer professions. to more learned statistical brethren i leave elaborations on the importance of refinements in statistical technique. my silence about these implies no disparagement. in the actual use of statistics, however, the more elementary principles are called into play hundreds of times more often. simple though these may seem, it is distressing to find how commonly they are violated. i speak of such things as discrimination between good data and bad, the proper use of aggregates, aver ages, and indexes, construction of tables and charts, and other phases of the (art of statistical exposition the everyday tools of one who uses statistics. one of the grave defects in our elementary and university education is that pupils cover ground without really mastering the rudiments. students emerge with college degrees who cannot add, sub tract, multiply, divide, spell, punctuate, and make sentences with a fair approach to accuracy. in the field of statistics corresponding defects are all too common. students compile data not worth compiling, manipulate data not worth manipulating. they compute arithmetic means, medians, and modes, but too often without learning where each is appropriate, what care to exercise with respect to the data averaged, and when any sort of aver age is only misleading. they use adding machines to arrive at huge aggregates, ignoring what dr. crothers called the heterogeneity of the miscellaneous. they apply formulas for computing trends, often blind to the fact that what they have computed utterly fails to indicate a true trend. they work up indexes on the unethical principle of caveat lector. they compute coefficients of correlation without realizing what these mean or when they have no meaning. they confuse mere association with causal relationship. they apply methods that produce confusing or misleading results, which they themselves are un able to recognize at their true worthlessness. they learn procedures of meticulous checking, and perhaps apply them assiduously, but remain ignorant of the higher art of super checking by which flagrant mistakes can be detected. they calculate standard errors, but overlook multitudes of sub standard errors. in a word, they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. unfortunately, this diatribe of mine does not apply to students alone. i doubt if any group of workers has a larger representation of experienced gnat strainers and camel swallowers than those who deal with or dabble in statistics. indeed, the statistical association has its quota of them, and its justification for existence lies partly in trying to overcome such defects. there is increasing need for statistics for estimates and guestimates, for forecasts and back casts, so long as the nature and basis of each is made clear. but we have too much of hit or miss statistics. statistics are proverbially dry forgive me if i say they are far better dry than wet to give them optimum moisture content is simply a matter of mastering fundamentals that no one should hold in contempt. in purely academic activities such shortcomings as i have noted are serious indeed, but their full seriousness is not readily revealed. in the applications of statistics in social engineering, however, practices are put to acid tests. if the bridge builder underestimates the strains to which the structure will be subject, overestimates the extent to which foundations, abutments, and cables will stand stresses of various sorts, and fails to provide an adequate margin of safety, the bridge will fall. if he makes the opposite mistakes, the cost will be excessively increased. it is similar with the builder of new social structures, small or great; defects of calculation and estimate lead to waste if not to destruction. you will see that i am no pollyanna. neither am i a prophet of dis aster or doom, and i cannot close on a critical or pessimistic note. i envisage the rise of a new profession of social engineering, with a future truly great. to its development we social scientists have much to con tribute, and from its progress social science has much to gain. in the training and practice of that profession, right use of the rudiments of statistics is one of the bed rock essentials. in the constructive work of the statistical association, one of the most worthy objectives is to promote the effective linkage of statistics and social engineering.

1937,"32nd","Burgess, W. Randolph","Male","Federal Reserve Bank of New York","Government","99th","December 27–30, 1937","Atlantic City, NJ",NA,"The Statistical Equivalent of Gold",1937-12-28,"W. Randolph Burgess","1908-1939","on the relation between gold and monetary policy there exists at i the moment a curious paradox. for four years the united states has bought gold at one fixed price and when the movement of funds was outward has sold gold at a fixed price. the fixed buying and selling prices have maintained the international value of the dollar. in that respect we have followed the operating practice of the gold standard more nearly than almost any other country. at the same time our domestic monetary policy is less influenced by gold than that of most other countries, and less influenced by gold than ever before in our own history. quite aside from changes in monetary laws our gold holdings have been so huge that domestic monetary policy is largely independent of gold. in a relatively short time, as human institutions develop, we have gone from a largely automatic currency system based on gold to what is in large measure a managed currency. we have not done this all in one leap, or by accident, or in the main as a part of the new deal. the longest step was taken twenty three years ago when the federal reserve system was established. it was indeed a longer step than was generally recognized at the time. little was said about credit control in the discussions of the bill, nor did the act itself define objectives for policy, except to say that discount rates should be fixed with a view of accommodating commerce and business. this phrase, and others in the act, suggest a mechanism for supplying business with a little extra money now and then for seasonal or emergency needs rather than the continuing control of credit. nevertheless the framework of the system with few changes was adequate for a much larger function. the war gave the first impetus for expansion of both objectives and operations. war was also responsible for a reversal of this countrys international position and a huge inflow of gold, again providing both the incentive and the material for a further growth of function. the depression, another vast increase in the gold supply, and a change in nations political economic philosophy have moved us further in the direction of monetary management. we have come a long distance and find ourselves in a country far from the point where we started. we may well ask ourselves how we may find our way about in this new country. where do the different roads lead and what do the sign posts in these strange new languages, such as are invented by keynes, mean. it was, at least in theory, simple enough in the old days. the gold supply operated directly on the money supply. it was the business of the central bank, where there was one, to protect the gold reserves. this guide to policy was sometimes blind and arbitrary, but it was definite and convincing. in the present strange new world, where the old gold portents have lost their former meaning, where is the radio beam which the central banker and others may follow? what is the statistical equivalent of gold? the change from a semi automatic gold standard to a far more flexible currency system, more subject to management, has i believe greatly increased the opportunities and responsibilities of the professions represented in this meeting. if the money mechanism were more automatic, or could be operated by rules and traditions alone, the responsibility for its operation could conceivably be left without much concern solely to a group of technically trained specialists. but when the bank of issue is facing such new problems in such a new situation, its success will depend in some considerable measure on the capacity of our two professions for applying to these problems the techniques of economic and statistical analysis, not alone for the benefit of the officers of the central bank, but for the guidance of political and public opinion. i am tempted to suggest that in some degree our two professions have brought this problem on themselves, for the wider and more general responsibilities of the federal reserve system, and of other central banks as well, are due not solely to the force of circumstances, but also to the trend of economic thought, which has favored more and more management. it is therefore only fair that we should aid the central bank in its search for the statistical equivalent of gold. there is gradually growing up a literature on this subject, most of it very recent, and most of it too general in its terms to be of much immediate use to the central bank. some of it is badly in need of the services of a sound statistical practitioner. even on basic principles there is far from general agreement. as to experience there are only a few years during which banks of issue have had anything approaching the present freedom of action, and these years have been so abnormal in their political and economic setting that results are hard to evaluate. in the interest of a proper humility it should perhaps be added that the greater freedom for management of money has not thus far yielded greater economic stability. the years of increased management have witnessed the widest business fluctuations for which we have records. but the times have of course been abnormal. powerful non monetary forces, including the sequelae of war, have been disrupting. the lessons of this experience are far from clear. i have no intention this evening of attempting to set forth an original solution of these problems, but what i propose to do is to outline more specifically some of the sorts of problems involved in finding a sound basis for central bank policy. it is perhaps natural that the first object of search should be some single index which would be as simple and convincing as the gold ratio. such an index would be a great comfort. it is fitting that we should pay our respects to several indexes which have been suggested to fill this important role. commodity prices. among possible guides to credit policy commodity prices should always be mentioned first, not alone because of their importance but also to avoid giving offense. for in this context commodity prices are the object of a form of religion, and price stabilizers have all the fervor of the most evangelical sect. seek this first and all these things shall be added unto you. few feel so strongly about production, employment , or other possible guides to policy. prices are certainly some measure of the kind of changes in the economic structure for which the central bank must be on the alert. they usually are sensitive to overexpansion or to incipient depression. but they and their interpreters are, alas, frequently misleading and confusing guides. in the macmillan report, for example, the stability of international prices is repeatedly emphasized as the main objective of monetary policy, but there is the qualification that before they are stabilized prices should first be put up a little, just how much the report does not say. this report was slightly aggrieved because during the period of the united states was not letting gold imports cause an upward movement of prices. on the other hand professor phillips and his associates in their recent book tell us that a policy of price stability was all wrong in this country in the twenties, because the normal trend of prices was downward. in 1928 the signs were certainly confusing, for commodity prices were level or declining at a time when most of the other signs showed the need for a policy of restraint. there are other difficulties as well. how about the situation today? in relation to the debt structure, prices probably ought to be higher than they are now, but how high, and how fast should the movement be? one trouble with price stability as an aim is that you have to start somewhere, and nobody knows quite where. may i suggest also that if a price index is to be compared with the changes in bank credit it must be broader than commodity prices alone. i suspect that wage rates and rents and the cost of living are just as important, and even, we are now willing to admit, the prices and yields of securities. more attention may well be given to relationships between the movements of different sorts of prices. but even these broader price studies, helpful as they may be, are not by themselves an adequate guide to policy. production and employment. the time honored formula recognized by the reserve board in its 1923 annual report was to the effect that danger signals were run up whenever production was operating to capacity and there was full employment. beyond that point supplies of credit were likely to result in competitive bidding for products. the formula still commends itself. it was especially applicable to the situation at the beginning of 1923. but it was not much help in 1928 and 1929 when there was still some leeway in plant capacity and in employment, and yet later events apparently showed that over investment had been taking place at least in certain directions. the movement of the production index alone is moreover an inadequate guide for credit policy for intermediate movements, like that of late 1936 and early 1937, when the rate of increase proved to be more rapid than could be sustained although operations generally were far short of capacity. of course, also, the mere fact of large and continued production of capital goods should not of itself be an indication of the need for restraint. there is no inherent reason known to us why the rate of growth of the standard of living, or per capita production, in this country should not be more rapid than, let us say, the two percent per annum rate to which we have become accustomed. the production index therefore is not the magic figure we are seeking as a guide to policy. recent efforts towards breaking down this index into significant parts which might show the extent of capital investment as distinguished from production of non durable goods have not yet gone far enough to justify conclusions as to their utility for the central banker, but they give promise of revealing some further knowledge of the nature of business fluctuations. volume of bank credit. another index which over a period of years has established some claim to consideration as a guide to policy has been the rate of growth of bank credit. the studies of carl snyder have shown that when the growth of credit has departed from the usual long term rate of growth of the countrys business, it has been an influence towards instability. but like every other index this one has gone bad from time to time. in 1928, for example, bank credit stopped increasing, but the increase in velocity, partly stimulated by lending of other agencies (security loans for account of others, more than made up. as in the case of prices a rule of reason is required in the interpretation. in addition to changes in velocity the rate of recently preceding growth or decline must be considered. for example, after the violent decline in the volume of credit at the time of the banking holiday a more than normal increase was a healthy expectancy, and after the very rapid increases of 1933 to 1936, largely due to government deficit financing, some pause in the rate of growth seemed reasonable and likely to be compensated by some increase from a very low velocity. just as in the case of prices some assumption must be made as to the starting point before the formula will operate. so even this valuable index may not be accepted as the sole guide. one might extend considerably this list of pretenders to the throne of gold, but in each instance we should be likely to discover some flaw in their lineage, some sound reason why they should not be elevated to the crown. some of them might with reason qualify as members of the privy council, but they do not deserve royal status. to use still another analogy the search for a single gold equivalent appears in the present state of our knowledge much like the search for the spring of perpetual youth, or for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. this disqualification of a sole guide to policy becomes clearer per haps if we visualize in real rather than abstract terms some of the decisions which must be made by central banks. there is, for example, always the difficulty of maintaining the balance between long term and short term objectives. let me illustrate. during the period of the twenties the federal reserve system made a vigorous attempt to use its powers in the interest of economic stability. it was this countrys most conscious attempt up to that time at the management of money for the public good. you will recall particularly the open market purchases of government securities in 1924 and 1927, and the sales in. when business declined, the system made money more freely available, and when it recovered, the system withdrew funds from the market. i quote from the experiment in stabilization from 1922 to 1928 showed that early treatment could check a tendency either to inflation or to depression in a few months, before any serious damage had been done. the experiment was a great advance upon the practice of the nineteenth century.”2 many others have been kind enough to give the reserve system credit for successful achievement in that period. but that, alas, is not the whole story. let me quote from wesley mitchell, for we think that the violence of convulsions such as occurred is due largely to the partial character of the liquidations effected during mild contractions. this conclusion, based on long study of the behavior of business fluctuations, surely gives one pause. in both 1924 and 1927 the reserve system recognized the possibility of business depression and took action promptly to cushion the decline. i have no doubt that its action played a part in lessening the severity of those recessions. is that not proper procedure in monetary management? and yet does not dr. mitchells conclusion lead one to wonder if we should not have fared better with less monetary management? if nature had taken its course and those minor recessions had been permitted to be more severe, they might perhaps have forced some readjustments in the economic mechanism and left less to be done when the big depression came in 1929. it may be that the business process requires at relatively frequent intervals periods of readjustment, and if these are shortened or avoided, the result in the long run is a more serious readjustment. if that is so, a number of interesting deductions suggest themselves. one is that monetary policy is a long term problem and that the results of any policy may not safely be judged for perhaps a decade. it may be even longer before we may judge, for example, the usefulness of stabilization funds as monetary mechanisms. it may be two or three decades, five or more presidential terms before we know the results of the devaluation of the dollar, and the results generally of operating with flexible currencies. another conclusion is that we are dealing in the business cycle not simply with a wave of psychology or with a short term commercial banking and current inventory fluctuation, but rather with the whole investment cycle. at least this is clear: that credit control has two aspects, a long term and a short term; and one of the hardest problems of all is to determine the relative weights to attach to each aspect. apply the question today if you will. the long range problem appears to be the avoidance of inflation. the short term is to get out of depression. how much is it safe to run risks on the first problem in order to deal with the second? we now have one billion dollars of excess reserves. is that enough to give the proper encouragement to reflation? is it so much that the underlying inflationary tendencies are unduly encouraged? is such long continued cheap money sowing the seeds of disequilibrium? the reserve system would, i am sure, be glad to have our suggestions on this point; now rather than five or ten years hence. a second puzzling problem which is interwoven with that just dis cussed concerns the relationship between monetary and non monetary influences on business fluctuations. again let me illustrate by a comparison between the depressions of 1920 21 and 1929 33. in the earlier period business and prices reached their high points in the first half of 1920 and declined rapidly in the autumn, so that by december they had made a considerable nose dive. federal reserve discount rates which had been raised to 7 percent in june had not yet been reduced. the records show that in december the question of a lowering of dis count rates was carefully reviewed. the conclusion was drawn that, while wholesale prices had declined precipitously, the necessary adjustments had not yet taken place in retail prices and the cost of living, and in industrial costs, and it was therefore unwise as yet to reduce the discount rate. to put the matter in modern language the officers of the system felt there was still disequilibrium in the non monetary factors and that necessary adjustments would be made more readily and fully with high than with low discount rates. the rate was not changed for several months. was this wise policy or not? in any event, recovery began in the middle of 1921 and was rapid and continuous. by contrast what happened in the recent depression? in this presumably more enlightened period the reserve system was much more prompt and reduced discount rates and bought large amounts of government securities within a few weeks of the onslaught of the depression. other governmental agencies mobilized for action. business came to the rescue with large programs of capital outlay. nevertheless the depression plumbed lower depths than in 1921 and has lasted far longer. now may we infer that if we had all been less enlightened and had been content to see nature take its course, at least in the earlier stages of the depression, that disequilibria might have been corrected earlier and the depression shortened? or shall we conclude that monetary policy is impotent in the face of dominant non monetary influences? the only conclusion which seems wholly safe is that we are painfully ignorant as to the interaction of these great forces. one way of visualizing certain phases of the relationship between monetary and non monetary influences is to be found in the distinction between cheap money and easy money. usually the two go together, but at the present time their paths have separated. the rates for short money and for prime bonds have been the lowest in the history of the country, and yet because of a feeling of uncertainty as to the future, the position of the borrower is scrutinized with the utmost care, and money is not easy to obtain for any but prime borrowers. it is an illustration of the limitations of the power of the central bank to influence even the effective supply of money. nonmonetary influences are preventing the large volume of funds which are available from flowing into any but restricted channels. thus while quoted money rates are low, money is not really easy. it is perhaps influences of these sorts which mark the difference between the depression in 1920 and 1921 and that from which we have gradually been emerging. these two problems of the balance between long term and short term policy and the relationship between monetary and non monetary influences illustrate the complexities which the central bank here or in any other country faces when it departs from the automatic procedures of the old gold standard and seeks a statistical equivalent. they show, it seems to me, the inadequacy of any single series of figures now available as a guide to policy. they seem to me also to define the scope of the problem. monetary policy is not something by itself but is simply one phase of a complex flow of economic forces, constantly changing in form and in human consequences. we cannot direct policy wisely until we understand far better than now the stream of economic fluctuations in which that policy plays a part. i am impressed particularly by how much more needs to be known about the longer term forces which influence business fluctuations. for example, it is often stated that a downturn in business is frequently brought about by increasing costs and declining profits, but there is sorely needed an analysis of the actual changes in business balance sheets and profit and loss statements which mark this turn. is it perhaps true that the causes of the turn do not show in these statements and that the higher costs which are a deterrent are those which never occur but are anticipated, which prevent plans from passing beyond the blue print stage? building costs today are perhaps an illustration. another direction of study of long term trends which seems likely to be fruitful is a closer analysis of the investment process and the relations within it of monetary and non monetary influences. the per son who borrows funds at long term for investment in enterprise must be convinced of his capacity to make profits over a long period. this involves a prediction as to selling prices, volume of sales, cost of material, wage costs, taxes, and freedom from ruinous competition. the lender of funds must have the money, and must be convinced not only of the character of the borrower but also of his capacity to earn a profit. the influence of monetary policy on this operation is usually indirect, in maintaining a stable or easy money market, which will encourage investing. it may of course supply funds which banks invest. perhaps its most valuable contribution is in discouraging periods of excess in which too much bank funds go into investments, tending to produce overinvestment, and in maintaining sound credit conditions as a basis for a sound investment market. clearly in the whole investment process monetary policy is only one of many factors in producing the result, and its success or failure will be largely conditioned by other factors. this is a process considerably different from the round of short term commercial lending in which the function of the central bank has traditionally been defined. the importance of a better understanding of the investment process is recognized in this program in a series of joint meetings of the economic and statistical associations on the influence of various factors on fluctuations of investment. these meetings move in the direction of supplying the central banking system with the kind of information it needs. now if the foregoing analysis is in any way correct, we cannot hope to find a single index which will be the statistical equivalent of gold. central banks must determine their policies in the light of the whole flow of economic fluctuations and especially the fluctuation of investment. central banks therefore cannot be run by statistics alone but must rely on the judgment of prudent and informed men. but the judgment of these men will be better as further advance is made in the analysis of all these problems. in this task the reserve system is in large degree dependent on the professions here represented. i cannot conclude this paper without mentioning a related central bank problem which is not precisely statistical in nature, but in which the members of these two societies may be of great aid towards the pursuance of sound policy. the bank of issue has two problems: one is knowing what to do; and the other is getting away with it. the old semi automatic gold standard had one great advantage not often mentioned : its decisions were accepted as necessities. when the bank rate was raised because of a decline in the gold reserves, the decision was not arbitrary; it might not be liked but it came in the same general class as the rain or the snow from heaven. it was in effect an act of god. not only so, but the position of the gold reserve has frequently been a persuasive argument for the balancing of the national budget or other legislation needed at critical times. the decisions of the central bank on broad economic grounds have no such persuasive force. i am reminded at this point of poem, a part of which reads: in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not winced nor cried aloud; beneath the bludgeoning of chance, my head is bloody but unbowed. do you suppose the brave stoicism of this poem is fairly representative of the reaction of human beings who may feel, justly or unjustly, that they have been injured by some act of the central bank which might be regarded as arbitrary in character? would it be possible for them to say in the fell clutch of the central bank i have not winced nor cried aloud; beneath the bludgeoning of money management my head is bloody but unbowed? we may well recall how the embattled farmer answered this question in 1920. after the so called deflation policy of the system in 1920, which we would criticize today only for its lateness, the political out burst from agriculture was swift and deadly. in 1929 the memory of the 1920 political reaction was still vivid and probably explains some of the reluctance to take vigorous discount rate action. when action was taken its effectiveness was lessened by the huge gold reserve in the background. high rates were regarded as arbitrary and artificial. to day low rates lose something in effectiveness for the same reason. but the real test comes when the central bank undertakes to tighten money, arbitrarily. as long as the bank of issue was charged simply with the duty of protecting the countrys gold reserve and so was presumed to be operating in a technical and limited field, it could claim some measure of protection from political pressure. but once the philosophy of monetary management is adopted, and policy decisions become as broad as the general welfare, freedom from political interference becomes a constant battle. the experience of managed currency systems is limited, but no such system has yet demonstrated its power to win that battle. by the force of circumstance and the force of the stream of economic opinion this country has accepted a large measure of monetary management. as students we have responsibility for developing information and understanding on the basis of which wise decisions may be made. we have also the responsibility of interpreting the functions of the central bank to the people of the country, so that they will preserve its freedom of action. if these tasks are beyond our fulfillment we should be the first to recommend the abandonment of the general plan and the return to some more automatic system. in his essay the moral equivalent of war, from which i have purloined my title, william james points out that war has been the force that can discipline a whole community. if there were no war the problem would be to find other means by which we might subject ourselves collectively to severities. the gold standard was a mechanism in the financial field by which we might subject ourselves collectively to severities. can we and will we do this without the pressure of a limited gold reserve? it is always easy to rationalize the path ,of least resistance, of indefinite monetary expansion. this way of financial life has many persuasive apostles. political pressure is always in this direction. the only salvation from this danger lies in an informed public opinion, and the source of such an opinion must be our two professions.

if bacon fell it was because of his deductions (the pun, alas, is pure james). my title is science and society, one must be in the fashion. incontinently i call the social sciences science, though the exact sciences have been stretching a hand of late upon us. overseas, are indeed. the cat amongst the pigeons. here, judging by our, they would not take over, but they do insist on social status. perhaps they have been reading walter lippmann who judges with president butler that joint stock ism, a purely social device, did as much as invention to increase production in the nineteenth century,2 at any rate it can buy up the patents. and history is aware of inventions before 1800, and the anthropologists statisticians now, by whose measurements the indian, the negro and the eskimo are the high brows of the continent) would say that it was the stirrup that made attila a nuisance long before poison gas and the fire bomb, our own fine flowers.5 but in truth there is nothing in history like the problem of to day. moreover, it grows. chemistry alone with :its catalyst and now its valence with quantum theory taking on the energy problem the sun and earth machine, the geo electric engine, a utilizable sub atomic potential perhaps! as to our biological future, it isnt decent; its brave new world makes dean inge sick in the english use. astronomy and four dimensional physics meanwhile poise us between co and in mere awe; and mass is energy and energy is mass, and so on: this is a snow flake that was once. we are like alice when she nibbled the mushroom and her chin got the stirrup enabled cavalry to thrust as well as deliver chopping blows. but the fire bomb has the edge especially on non combatants, as bruno mussolini volli sulk ambe, (recommended to italian schools) elucidates: i got only mediocre effects because i was expecting enormous explosions whereas the little abyssinian homes give no satisfaction to anyone bombing them. the incendiary bombs give satisfaction, at any rate one sees the fire. we set fire to the wooded hills and the little villages: it was all most diverting: i began throwing bombs by band. it was most amusing. a big was not easy to hit. i had to aim carefully. the wretches inside, seeing their roof burning, jumped out and ran like mad. tangled with her toes. not that the social sciences could advance till physics and chemistry had defined the environment, and biology and psychology had told us what we are statistics were not very necessary before 1700. but now, as i say, the cry is for help, the need is dire. man must not wear his science like the shirt of nessw6 but in the vernacular, is he who heaves the brick the one to assess the damage, noble as it is to offer? and is the bal to be the cartesian economics of the chemists. or the technocracy or the social credit of the engineers? ah no, the tail must not wag the dog, even a ninety six inch tail on a four inch dog. in the new salvation army the social sciences must take over and direct the natural sciences, not vice versa of course, like general booth, not letting the devil monopolize the good tunes. this is all the natural sciences want to tell us how. my point is that, so far, they lack definiteness in the telling. and here without further build up my title regresses to statistics and science, not that the change is so great. in close upon the 100th year of our association and of the physique sociale and of cournots recherches; about the 200th of the treatise of human nature; one is almost compelled to the pleasant theme. james himself could have wished no wider for his dis cursive tongue. one other apologetic: a preacher (scottish) once explained that when he said religion he meant the protestant religion, and by the protestant religion the presbyterian religion, and by presbyterianism the wee free kirk. so i in like felt crescendo address you only as a statistical administrator, but that of a central statistical bureau, a ministry as it were of all the talents. james, who wrote thirty books on forty subjects (from predestination to tobacco), was an administrator when kings were kings; an office like mine which has many times james output (and on more subjects), is of a day when statisticians are fast becoming statisticians. if therefore i speak in all the bravura of the basilikon doron, you will understand. beginning softly, statistics has long been handmaid to these exact sciences, apprenticed in the scullery, but now risen housekeeper, eating with the family. statistical averages and distributions now supplement the old inductive processes everywhere, i.e., the observing of experimentation has become scientific. this opens a dozen vistas. passing would say less tragically, the tin can, marvel though it be, must not be tied to society, even in the form of womens suffrage. the invention of the tin can led to canning factories; it reduced the time in preparing meals; it thus gave women more time for activities outside the home. the influence of invention and discovery astronomy the pioneer (our motion through space only an index number. passing biology the preeminent (species only a statistical grouping); let us glance down just the two most distractingly intimate to homo sapiens, the two he places first in the prayer book, preceding economics : medicine and psychology. medicine. medicine, a fragment of greek science, all but perished when slave labour divorced the manual from the mental, leaving diet to nurses, materia medica to monks and apothecaries, surgery to barbers. the renaissance set that straight, and vital statistics for a hundred years has been signaling just where to train the guns a reconnaissance on foot at first, now the scouting airplane. think modern medicine will add, say, another ten years to life. but though this still leaves back to methuselah to biology and bernard shaw, did you notice the fuss over the new fertility questions in england lately, and the indignation of mr. a. p. herbert, m.p., that women should be thought of like cattle mr. herbert is a humourist (at any rate he is an editor of punch) and still looks for children under gooseberry bushes, or for embryology in ecclesiastes. but the doctor of 1938 is being taught more than birth, death and morbidity reports, or how in the laboratory to correlate the elusive bacteriophage, he is being taught how to capitalize his experience. startling is the hint of what may happen from an unscientifically analyzed hospital record, and how easily a doctor may fool himself (and you and me) on what are quaintly called his survival after treatment rates. one would say again that individual diagnosis for malnutrition in school children would be superior to objective mass tests based on physical and physiological measurements, but it appears not: the in sufficiency of the clinician judgment in many a field could have no better demonstration. the public is sensing this. preventive medicine will soon include preventive statistics, and doctors will apply therapy in the light of. bound though it remain to the old cartesian duality, the psychology that has shaken our time is objective. energies, instincts, libidos, complexes, mostly of that new induction the unconscious mind, are the interest; urgency the yardstick; measure and all those who are any ways afflicted or distressed in mind, body or estate. recalling the classic speech by one in the british house of commons in 1753 when a census was proposed over the head of king davids experience: i did not believe that there was any set of men or indeed any individual of the human species so presumptuous or so abandoned as to make the proposal which we have just heard. dictionary of political economy, art. census. move forward the slogan. quantitative goes hand in hand with qualitative even in accounting for cognition. the problem of judgment (the harmony of reason and emotion), says graham wallas, is quantitative. the intelligence test bogged down till statistics replaced diagnostic galtons correlational coefficients theorem has expanded into the multiple factor analysis of temperamental and character traits, for better captaincy of the soul. and finally there are the para psychologists. we have all been playing professor rhines new card game the extra sensory perception (telepathy, clairvoyance) game. it appears that professor, endowed to assess psychical research and assessing it nil, slipped up in his statistics. the duke experiments took off by creating the phenomena, thence statistically. sad to say they grow less exciting. but will this new sheep ever win to the psychological fold? did the woman of endor really raise samuel? or have she and saul and later compeers of the poltergeist been merely raising cain? statistics is having a lot to say about it from the stage, not the coulisses. background this statistical universe. and, hark, what strain is this from the circumambient ether, wherein, as eddington whispers, something unknown is doing we dont know what! the second law of thermodynamics is just sampling and averaging; we can visualize its contradiction, as by maxwells demon. thus entropy, the alpha and omega, whereby the cosmos will surely one day reach thermodynamical equilibrium, and the present once and for all catch up with the future, and the forecaster cease from troubling (in a nirvana of commingled history and geography) entropy is just proportional to the logarithm of the probability of the universe. that may not matter for those of us who have things to do first (we have a thousand billion years to go), and in the space time continuum. since theres no help, come, let us kiss and part will tell the hysterica passion of lovers for that long, but statistics sets the ineluctable end. and, again, since heisenberg, there is no cast iron determinism in physics (there never was, says dingle) only statistical laws; the electron is just a smear of probability a holistic arminian as it were; and the quantum physicists art is the art of the bookmaker. we cannot define and confine the human unit? well, neither can the physicist the electron, which is both velocity and position a series of discrete happenings (teleologically or causally inspired let them fight it out) impossible even to imagine connectedly. matter is but a mathematic of events: where numbers are large chance is the warranty. physics and biology are not simpler than sociology, they are only bigger, i.e., have larger aggregates to work on. and now, mr. chairman, i approach the social sciences, where, if this were an epic, i should make ad hoc invocation of the muse to the height of this great argument, while it pursues not only la statistique but les statistiques, a brahma indeed. statistics are primarily for executive use, to do things with which weds us at a word to applied science. but frankly i was also brought up consule planco to think that statistics were parade ground for theory, that statistics and theory were like huz and buz of whom genesis makes the cheery remark that huz was the brother of buz, and leaves it at that. but notoriously no poor relation expects to be made much of. and greatly though we be risen in the world today, let us still beware of nouveau riche pretentions. but let me bandy words for just one moment, at safe distance James had a genius for raising dangerous questions and settling none. professor hayek comes close to the cut direct. man, to professor hayek, hangs midway between nature and society, the effect of one, the cause of the other. in nature the essential facts can only be surmised, but in society they are part of the stuff of our thinking, unknown beyond the possibility of dispute. in the natural sciences, therefore, the empirical lies in the elements, whereas in the social sciences it is in the inductive process. statistics cannot verify; they can, however, pose new problems. naturally, in the hayek epistemology (not to say solipsism) statistical technique sings low. even so might walter lippmann, nonplussed as to what he would like for breakfast, reflect how many million times harder it would be to order breakfast for the united states. and lionel robbins has a fling at quantitative economics for never having discovered a law. but if it was economic legalisms that ruined spain, lost the thirteen colonies, retarded factory legislation and set up a wages fund, (resembling providence at least in being consistently on the side of the big battalions) robbins himself would call it a day with us when fact leads on to larger fact, as for example when kuznets on capital formation improves on previous analysis. in the midst of his quantitative thinking, when he falls upon professor douglass demon stration of the classic method of (1) the hypothesis; (2) the equation; (3) the verification by statistics (unfortunately douglas failed to verify the famous three percent); would still agree with the much quoted mathematics is a subject where we do not know what we are talking about or whether what we are saying is true. of bertrand of course statistics is accustomed to gloatings over her frailties; some even transfer their own illusions to her, as if the moon were to blame when burns saw too many horns. now burns poses the problem. surely our bane is that the things known beyond the possibility of dispute have a way of turning out not so. looking at the moon, burns counted. he counted wrong, as a statistician in will, but his method was right. it may be only a trick of the brain that the one thing it can grasp comfortably is quantity, that until we measure a phenomenon we do not. professor knight, e.g., is scandalized at discrepancies of 40 percent in cotton estimates, but not at theories which are diametrically or 100 percent opposed to each other. (in the trend of economics.) the particular burns incident is in death and doctor hornbrook: the rising moon began to glower the distant hills out: to count her horns, but whether she had three or four, i set know it, but it is the trick that has given us science, or the mathematical description of things, based of course on the faith that things yield to such description. yet for thousands of years men thought it foolish to use their eyes on what their minds told them so clearly, and aristotle (in the old story) promulgated that heavy objects fall faster than light, till galileo dropped a mixed lot off the pisa tower. however, is different when burns is looking not at the moon (perceptually) but at his fellow men and himself (conceptually) for a new subjective emerges, and the social sciences are enmeshed. well, but society is not an individual but millions of individuals, and millions do stay put. analogy may mean much or nothing, as mill says, and it may be little practical that the sciences are steadily converging upon one another and tautologically upon the flower in the crannied wall, but the new physics is more than titillating. the physicists seem, if from another planet one may say it, like when he discovered that he had been talking prose all his life: they have discovered that the physical un verse is not hard but fuzzy like the social universe. but if this gives a new status to probability, it must not and does not abate the extreme of deterministic care over the observed foundations. in the war that comes down every wind between the aristotelians (misnomer rather hard on aristotle) and the galileans over the (cos molatries of milne, eddington and the rest (an aftermath of relativity), the aristotelians would shift from prose to ]poetry, from physics to metaphysics, where we may all land at last if we are interested in what things are rather than in what things do. (back to hume, who abolished causation ! back to berkeley, who abolished matter !) but statistics has the best of both these worlds, its detail (les statistiques) the aristotle similarly said that air had no weight, and man went seventeen centuries without the common pump. aristotle made few observations himself, and had a very limited range of facts from which to generalize. his was a philosophical age. but he clearly understood the objectives of scientific method and research. his followers listen to him saying let us first understand the facts and then we may seek their causes. again, we must not accept a general principle from logic only, but must prove its application to each fact, for it is in facts what we must seek general principles, and these must always accord with the facts. but emotionalize the new mathematics from a tool and fifth sense into a science self contained. eddington, however, can derive n, which now replaces infinity as the number of particles in the universe, by sheer knowledge of relativistic quantum analysis: by looking at the articles in a house. we reach the generalization that none cost more than sixpence, but we can reach it equally well by knowing that they were bought. the aristotelians are attracting endowments, which is bitter. very stuff of empiric, its mass (la statistique) the dread kismet of law. of course the nearest analogue to economics in science, since marshall will have it so, is biology. marshall rather fobbed off mendel, and one wonders what he would say of needhams statistical biology and the continuity of inorganic, biological and social order.27 there has always been overlapping too in the old opposition of experiment and observation as method. astronomy and meteorology among the natural sciences do without experiment : we can predict eclipses, but weather not so well, so we call nikias a fool, but still pray for rain. but how danger us to say any longer that the social sciences cannot experiment: not only that but the experimentee can talk back while the experiment is on what no cell or atom can do. for the loudest note is over the current statistical controls that might have been. keynes thinks economists should go on government committees. so say all of us, if they will bear yet another injunction in mind: to clothe the dry bones of theory with appropriate statistics (there being an appropriate boneyard no doubt when the clothes will not go on). and i make bold to believe that a poll of economic practitioners will find four out of five practicing just this device statistics. on this i make the observation that ordinary training in economics is not training for research: it sounds incredible, but there are exhibits from time to time by economists, welcomed by others, which are just bad statistical work at least i know it may be so in denmark. bien entendu economists should not be adding to star pyramid; einstein may never touch an instrument, but he does not take on laboratory jobs. the biology of tomorrow will be statistical. one solitary isolated phenomenon is of no more interest to the biologist than the man in the moon. it is not until we begin to deal with whole populations of facts that regularities begin to appear. and again: living things differ from dead things in degree and not in kind, and are as it were at. I fear my distinguished colleagues of the platform like queen victoria are not amused, so i repeat that i speak only as a government statistician behind the chair as it were of dionysius, whom james by the way took for model but who is better known for giving plato the sack, pour encourager les autres to this day. 32 our job is to assist the largest of executives on specific, usually pressing, problems of administration, of social policy just the field in which society is falling down, says science. of course we should like to be as huz and buz with theory, and impossible as it sounds in these days of specialization i believe most government statisticians could say of theory as josiah allen of paradise lost that if they have not read it all they have hefted it. part of the reward (one has to say it) is the dazzling controversy, sometimes all along the line foot, horse and artillery as with barbara wootton last summer. but unless called to give evidence, the statistician can but murmur to this, either. thought alone cannot establish any non verbal fact. if a law is general enough it cannot help being right, but of what use is it to governments who cannot summon help from ceteris paribus or wait upon the long run, for the ceteri are human beings all with votes it is majorities not modais that matter. by a categorical imperative government economics is empirical. all of which leads to the one point in this paper, adumbrated when i said that the scientists in springing to the help of the economists are not practically minded. notwithstanding the advances of the past decades, notwithstanding that we have certain materials to suffocation, the problem remains the how of things, as when newton never made a theory till the facts required it (non hypotheses fingo). pigou is right: economics is not so hard, if only we could know what we are talking about. i shall expand on the latter in a moment. but first may i exemplify? i choose two subjects, unemployment and population, for their topicality, and i use canadian statistics, not i hope another of the bores whose geese are swans, but simply as proffering chips from the workshop i know. empiricist at large unemployment. to the orthodox, unemployment is disequilibrium. it wouldnt happen in a free market, except transitionally. when it does reduce wages, restore production and thus take up the slack. relief is another rigidity. per contra, mr. keynes tracks this dionysius. whom i took for my pattern, the rather that he was a great linguist and grammarian and taught a school with good applause after his abdication (either he or his successors the same name, it matters not.unemployment past cyclical maladjustment to its lair in unemployed resources, unwillingly unemployed because savings are not flowing into investment. for cure, reduce the rate of interest, which is not the reward of abstinence but a premium on not hoarding swayed by liquidity preference, savings being a by product of the level of income. orthodoxy invokes scarce means; mr. keynes would prime the pump, after the philosophy of mr. alfred dolittle. pardon this unseemly brevity in so many volume a matter. no doubt more and better barometrics would help in this, diminishing too that strain upon intuitive banking of which president burgess spoke with pathos a year ago, that trouble in distinguishing cheap from easy money, new capital equipment from replacements in generally maintaining the feel of thing.what finally is this cycle, not always of contrasting but often of similar interrelations of factors on the way up and on the way down; whose path is more the strayed revellers than the pendulum which shows signs of stepping out of the picture altogether stamp indeed says it will vanish once we define it, like a complex, or one of stuart chases referents. the league of nations is promising a world look out, statistical one hopes, and has already got from professor haberler a synthetic framework of theory.36 but to night i approach from the other end, that of the unemployed themselves, who though ignorant of seismology know how the earthquake hit them. i invoke, as before said, the canadian scene. we overturned a government in canada in 1930 and held a special keynes makes the assumption that the more income people receive, the larger proportion they save, whereas the classical economists assume that savings will be much less flexible. as human wants are unlimited. both of these statements, of opposite bearing on policy, are without verification, though a family budget study over the gamut of incomes would clarify the point. miss gilboy seems to say that for large classes of the population, keyness postulates are not so. business forecasting, it has been said, must be by observation not by theory, and in observation we must not be hypnotized by our tools, but must get the feel of the phenomena themselves. the business trend is full of all sorts of swirls and eddies that change as the stream strikes new channels, often working in diverse directions. according to one school of thought we are now experiencing a major intermediate recession in a major cyclical recovery, but this view is opposed by those who argue that it is a minor intermediate recession in a major cyclical recovery. more pessimistic are the people who dispute whether it is a major or a minor intermediate recession in a minor cyclical recovery, and these who plump for a minor intermediate recession in a minor cyclical depression are outbid by whose who insist that it is a major intermediate recession in a minor cyclical depression. the realists ask us to face the fact that it is a minor intermediate recession in a major cyclical depression and the cassandras go all out for a major intermediate recession in a major cyclical depression. the truth can probably be summed up in calvin coolidges dictum that when a large number of people are out of work a state of unemployment can he said to exist. prosperity and depression. of course, it does not satisfy all economists. session of our parliament; enacted then and thereafter a long series of relief measures; turned out another government; and finally set up an employment commission; in all of which unemployment was public enemy no. 1. it still surprises some that in our 1931 census we found nearly as much wage earning employment in canada, per capita of population, as in 1921 when we had no such disturbance. there was vastly more unemployment among persons working for wages, but why? because there were proportionally more wage earners. because in the interval, while population increased only 18 percent, and the total gainfully occupied only 20 percent, the number of wage earners increased 30 percent. under ((prosperity the wage earners curve had siphoned a great hump out of the curve of workers on own account. when the boom broke this was projected as unemployment: the boom made jobs were gone, the individual had cut the painter with his old a second element can be isolated quite handily: industry as it becomes mechanized, rationalized, integrated, centralized, increasingly constricts its labour supply; the rejects tend to become casual. this is secular, not cyclical, i.e., it is not a durable vs. consumption goods phenomenon. moreover, unemployment is not a matter of all or the majority of workers being sometimes employed and sometimes idle, but of a differentiation (which is hardening) into two classes, the one seldom employed, the other seldom unemployed. the unemployed thus appear, first a sort of human scaffolding cast aside when the building stage of enterprise is over; secondly, a series of discards made as operating requirements are worked out. some 1931 and 1936 figures are interesting. in 1936 certain industries showed an increase in numbers at work, whilst others showed a de crease, the increases aggregating 31,000, the decreases 24,000. you would expect less unemployment in the first category, but there was not, the reason being that, though the number at work increased, the total number of wage earners increased pari passu. meanwhile the industries that had 24,000 fewer jobs had actually fewer unemployed, because 30,000 workers got out of them, and this was not to any great extent a transfer to the increasing industries. how important is the Canadian census, it will be noted, breaks up the total gainfully occupied population into (a) wage earners, and (b) workers on own account. the differentiation varies with industry; it is much greater in an industry in which a small proportion lose time than in one in which a high proportion report some loss of time the degree of difference appears to be a function of time lost, a fact of direct bearing on relief policy. the 1936 census from which these figures are taken covered only the three prairie provinces. the complete figures are as follows: while the total number of gainfully occupied increased, the number of workers on own account increased, so that the number of wage earners decreased. meanwhile the number of un employed wage earners decreased by 18,739. distribution factor is seen of course if we project the 1921 31 trend: it would require, by 1941, an increase of 26 percent in volume to maintain even the 1931 proportion of continuously employed, yet at that the number losing time would be swelled by 50 percent. what of wages and earnings? it is the low wage class that shows heaviest unemployment. indeed, it would seem that the higher the wages the steadier the employment. less than a half of our wage earners receive perhaps 80 percent of the wages bill; had all our unemployed worked full time in 1931 it would have added less than 15 percent to that bill. could they have been put to work by wage reductions in the higher brackets? well, if we cut the wages of, say, statisticians, (which heaven forfend), we might theoretically hire more and increase output, but we could not hire from amongst the unemployed because there are no unemployed statisticians in canada, and no statisticians employed at other than statistical jobs. alas, there are too few altogether. race and sex have little bearing. there is unemployment amongst the races attracted by the boom conditions, but that is not race. female workers fare as badly as the males ceteris paribus, except as regards long time unemployment: as a class they are in occupations less exposed to unemployment. as to age, the old and the young are not more apt to lose their jobs, as is commonly said, but it is harder for them to obtain new ones.41 seasonality is not the bugbear it is sometimes painted. i review these facts because it has been said that quantities of employment can be made strictly homogeneous (keynes fabricates a labour uniy playmate to the economic man); and again that high prices of raw materials counteract high industrial wages as labor magnets during a boom. distance no doubt lends homogeneity to the view, but those who must provide relief, preserve occupational skill and maintain morale in a country, cannot use the big end of the tele scope. there is all the difference in the world between the entire working force losing a couple of weeks a year, and 5 percent of it losing the whole year. yet in many an apercu this disappears, as from an airplane disappear those earth wrinkles so distressful to road builders, excellently as earth sphericity is revealed. suggested remedies are also general: the well being of the body, it is presumed, is the well being of the cell. but if low interest does not distribute as well as create demand for a unit of labor per unit of production, it will not eradicate commenting on the common view that men become too old to be retained in employment, points out that old union records run directly counter to this view. in them at least men seem able to work on to a later age than they could a generation ago. how unsuitable, summing up a masterly analysis of the british insurance figures, is unemployment for abstract theorizing in general terms. the beginning of an understanding of the unemployment problem is to break it up, and he goes on to suggest improved organization of the labor market.43 now figures like these are not the whole story, and it is their proportional effect which counts. but neither can advice be lifted out of macroscopic cycle theory dosing the patient without looking at him. so we may repeat our canadian census of unemployment in 1941, (if we could extend it to capital and income a real critique could be written), unless of course the world equilibrates its equilibrium in the meantime; at present, equilibration is proceeding via measures to ex terminate the species.& housing. a footnote on housing, the supply of which is more responsive to variations in income than in building costs, as the trade cycle knows. less known is it that the rate of increase of number of rooms per person at progressive earnings levels tends to be highest in the middle earnings groups, while the ratio of rent to earnings actually increases for a brief interval in the lower groups. in other words, a simple statement of engels law requires qualification as a description of housing expenditure. such at any rate emerges from certain canadian census which are also suggestive of how the equating of crowding and the evaluation of the low rent problem may be approached. they make two points abundantly clear: first, sampling surveys, of which we have so many nowadays, are intelligible and safe for generalization only if based upon census controls made possible by cross classification of earnings, rent, size of household, number of rooms per household, etc.; secondly, there is a basic relationship between income and the adequacy of housing. yet the league of nations is sponsoring a world housing census which leaves income out of the picture are sociologists interested? 4* incidentally it is not to be assumed that spreading jobs on the part time principle does nothing to increase aggregate purchasing power and thus up turn the cycle; it probably does. certain of beveridges a priori statements require qualification for canada, e.g., an increased demand for labor will not produce insufficiency of supply and a rise in wages as readily as in great britain, owing to our larger reserve of potential wage earners. the law of gravitation is not that bodies attract each other, but, that the attraction is proportional to the product of their mass divided by the square of their distance. but the distribution factor in employment has been overlooked and is certainly of first importance. expenditures of 60 nations on armaments, have increased. in this widest field of all, recent theory is but standard authorities should not preach birth control in 1930 and proliferation in 1937, however Canute like either time, it is dis concerting. i could wish we might likewise catch up on that continental myth, immigration. now, population is very practical politics: a country definitely must know what is, and whither tends, its population. this includes, (1) all about each population attribute in itself, and (2) the interplay of attributes upon the composite. especially must canadians give themselves to think in these channels, for we are but 11 millions on half a continent, much counsel do we suffer on it. the counsel would be bearable if it appreciated canadas growth process which is, that we have increased by four times since 1850, but so has the area populated area means space that can be occupied under current incomes and standards of living. it is the relation of area to population nucleus that is important. our original settlement proceeded from points of distinct saturation, for troughs not levels were left in the rear: inner counties in canada have smaller populations today than thirty, forty, or fifty years ago, or we would have a million more people. on top of land settlement, a second (city) growth impulse has worked itself out, likewise a spreading. we are told ex cathedra that populations do not act in this way, but ours does. how many of such processes are written into our fate we do not know and no projection will tell us, though a new cycle is looming. over speed has been the prevailing mistake. an interesting fact is, that though no simple curve fits our growth alone, a logistic does fit a compound of growth and area. the drosophila melanogaster bottle was closed: the canadian bottle is an expanding a byproduct is our extraordinary situation with respect to our very convenient neighbor. in the eighties, for every thousand added to the native born in canada, we donated to you: even in today we are as ignorant of the causes which govern the birth rate as we were ignorant a century ago of the causes which govern the death rate. as items: the maritime provinces of canada are in contrast with many other sections of the continent: no new natural resources have been developed, no territory has been added, nor have they experienced much stimulus of industrialization. for nova scotia the trend of population from the earliest times until the present forms a logistic, with a slowing up above the point of inflection concurrently with movements into western canada and the united states. these episodes over, the curve is returning to form, pending a new cycle. from jacob to the census of moses, and from the earliest settlement of the french until the present is about the same time lapse: the growth of the two populations is the same. in this last decade, canadas total population increased by 1,589,000, but as excess of births over deaths was 1,582,000, and as 335,000 canadian born returned from the united states, we had 330,000 canadian born alone in excess of our increase. yet we received one and a half million immigrants. fluidity like this explains why the discussion is even more vapid to us than to others, and why a new chapter in the malthusian controversy is just a sweepstake without a ticket. omnibus interpretation by all means. but what omnibus? we mustnt take the wrong one. nothing could be more encouraging than the u.s. report on population of the national resources committee, which surely sets a new mark.49 in canada also we know our way around, though sweden and the netherlands beat the world in up to the minute bookkeeping. in this new atmosphere i should like to see the various census offices borrow a leaf from the astronomers, and work cooperatively. there should be a minimum list of census rubrics, and agreement as to cross classifications. over and above domestic uses, the fields which need intensive treatment could be parceled out, and we could help each other with special data.60 (we have produced a census machine in canada that has multiplied such analyses to finality at half the old cost: the united states was the first to develop a census tabulator, but we have the last and best so far! it sorts and in the same run takes off everything on the card, adding up incomes, time series, etc. !) only in some such way will we conjoin with biology, sociology, human ecology, in a real science of population, when robust common sense like dr. johnsons on the birth rate will pass out, together with some latter day pontification its lineal descendant. as just said, the astronomers nautical almanac (not altogether nautical) is a demonstration visible even to the naked eye of the layman. has paved the way, and the population union offers a forum. one would not add to the things of mary amid the din and dither of the haves and the have nots still murdering the gracchi and prophesying war. but i would think a world census understanding as hopeful d la martha as, say senor de madariagas world bank or world mandates scheme. it is true that senor de madariaga describes himself as born in spain, but a citizen of the world. of course, there must be more censuses, and some quaint methods of the past must disappear of the population association of america. and of course vital and migration statistics must keep pace. but i am overshooting i come back to the substantive part. the job of defining what applied science has done to society is statistical, and the defining will tell a lot of what to do about it. and the first step towards setting statistics to work in the grand manner thus is their organization in what knibbs once called an articulated conspectus of the national life and affairs. in brief, the statistics of governmental activities, with those created for information, should be subsumed in a general plan, horizontally as well as vertically organized, looking to complete and systematic exploitation of the overhead. the purpose is simply to see the structure whole and as a unison, so that when an essential is missing we shall know continuously, (a) that it is missing; (b) why it is missing; and (c) just how and where to make it good. a first rate example is the need we are just discussing; but if we have a coordinated scheme of production and trade statistics in their social and economic setting, with the interested government agencies tied into it, any special point of view like this can be elaborated or super imposed at a fraction of the cost and labor otherwise. i believe that (1) the committee set up by the international council of scientific unions, which has the science and society matter in hand; (2) the league of nations committee on intellectual cooperation, which also has the identical matter in hand; and (3) the new section of the british association, which also is to tackle the problem and to link up with some similar body here (a world brain trust it is already beginning to be maliciously called) ; would do well, on the principle of first things first, to give attention, not to the creation of new agencies for more materials not to the ad hoc creation of new materials but to this basal matter of organizing the agencies and recreating the materials we already have, just as the multitudinous and orderly enrollment of stars has been the arduous prelude to astronomy. they must come for this, i fear, like everyone else nowadays, to governments, for governments alone have the two things needful, the powers and the money. to multiply statistics into universes with the needful cross classifications; to ensure homogeneity so that they shall be usable from multiple points of view; to see that they relate to government and life in as wide a way as the machinery permits, and to point where necessary to further economical machinery; only organization as an end in itself can compass this. at the top, free and using such organization as working arm, let there evolve great institutes for inductive social research, to the substitution with aristotles inevitability of gradualness, with sciences approaching truth by successive approximations of judgment for improvisation in our important affairs. under those portals let no iota either of the tribe, the den or the market place enter (would say no idol of logic, of purity or of caution). statistics is first of all statistiques: nature is not so kind as in the natural sciences we have to make our matter. in this connection one grows tired of hearing of amorphous masses of purposeless knowledge. purposeless for what? most of gods factual chilluns got wings. there was a day when i thought the economists would take this in hand, and some have nobly: keynes never ceases scolding, and wesley mitchell once went so far as to say that government statisticians should have more pay. but mostly statistics are mentioned hopelessly, like something forgotten at the picnic, though we saw likens economists to clothiers, and clearly clothiers should have an interest in the textile industry. and i regret to add that cantankerousness in statisticians is not unknown. a zionist movement, even to a palestine with no arabs, has less allure sometimes than spoiling the egyptians. but the diaspora is reassembling. specialization in statistics, as in medicine, is the opposite of decentralization: it is the water tight compartment that is bureaucratic. here james has a hint for us. his prime exploit was to round up the turbulent scottish no ability in fealty to the common law. of this it is enough to remark (of course d propos de bottes) that of his six immediate predecessors in the task two were murdered, two fell in battle, one died of chagrin, whilst james himself was more than once the mark of private war. james by the way whittled down his divine right of kings from in abstract to in concrete in other words when faced with hard realities he backed down, as an apriorist always should do, for all he may have the better of the logic. as for research, the crown of the edifice, he would be insatiable who was not happy in progress, reaching apex in the social science research council. in ottawa you may stand upon a bridge and view the palace of the national research council, builder of enthusiasm in the natural sciences. on the other hand is the bureau of statistics (it would bore statisticians to dwell in marble halls) crammed with the makings of social research of more than local import. our model has been, shall we say engel? it was cromwell, ruler of the saints who called democracy the creed of all bad men and poor men. as for theoretic demands why not list those amenable to observation and the statistics they need, hoping that when these are cleared up the unamenable may by the mercy of providence turn out mostly of no practical use as they have done elsewhere in science. on the direct job, one need fear neither mills nor edgeworths warning as to empiricism, for in such a milieu is created that atmosphere of the artisan thinking about his job which salter says accounts for most practicalities: the most important parts of the steam engine were invented by labourers. and it is with the man on the job too that will burgeon that new technique (as with the biologists) which sets the pace for all the rest, still only mewing its youth. one may walk warily over inverse probability vs. maximum likelihood, but yet wish well of r. a. fishers simple making sense of figures, the reduction of the multitudinous so that it can enter the mind, the open mind. our method has certainly not lacked breadth in these late marvellous years, but has it realized conceptual depth? neyman is demanding a grammar of statistic. the national economic council movement of the twenties has some lessons. about were set up in as many countries. somewhere for quasiexecutive jobs, and these they may have done well enough. but where in the absence of statistical organization they have taken on research, they have petered out or gone on footling errands. the natural sciences can be better satisfied with guerilla warfare than the social. but how shall we put across such doctrine? it is trite to say, by education but what else? miss walker has most adequately reviewed our university teaching of statistics.68 (i could wish statistical teaching. edgeworth considers that if the investigation of the conditions which determine value were abolished, there would survive only the empirical school flourishing in the chaos congenial to their mentality. but hayek, who quotes this against planning, comments, we are as far from capital ism in its pure form as we are from any system of central planning. the world of today is just interventionist chaos. in deductive reasoning all knowledge obtainable is already latent in the postulates. the successive inferences growing less and less accurate as we proceed. in inductive reasoning we are per forming part of the process by which new knowledge is created. the conclusions normally grow more and more accurate as more data are included. that errors in the knowledge postulated a priori will produce less and less effect on the conclusions drawn as the observations are made more and more abundant seems to be a reason not for thinking that the postulate is true but rather that it must be possible to draw valid conclusions without its aid the logic of inductive inference, by r. a. fisher. it cannot be that axioms established by argumentation can suffice for the discovery of new works. she did not include canada: i grieve to say she would have found no chair of statistics, and that five of our twenty two universities do not know the word in their curricula it is either contrary to the koran and impious, or agreeable to the koran and superfluous. hogben jeers at universities that are never lying in hospitals to new sciences, and indeed it is forty years since pearson declared the logic of statistics as important to teach as the analysis of mathematic. galileo proceeded by capturing the universities. we statisticians cannot make a close corporation of ourselves like the actuaries, though we could be closer than we are, and it would be useful to know broadly what is meant when a man calls himself a statistician. the future of statistical quality in no small measure depends on esprit de corps. still it is public opinion that counts, and the school is more important than the college. alexandrians like eratosthenes and apollonius knew that the earth was round, and how big it was, that the sun was 90,000,000 miles away, and so on, but epicurus who guessed the sun was two feet wide won out for years. progress is never faster than popular thinking. High school in my day took us to binomial theorem, but statistics were like railway time tables. it is even so today; from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath is still a moral conundrum, not just a fact as pascal showed the gamblers of the seventeenth century (and so on to the life table and all that has come of it.). statistics is solid with big business, but many a business failure results from over short and long chances. statistical thinking, says h. g. wells, will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and to write. i believe i mentioned money, and that our governments had it. they must have, for their united debt is over billions. but the money part should be easy (and without james guile in money matters). put it this way: any business man having $1,000 to spend would gladly pay for sound factual guidance. apply this to governments and it would enlarge us by four or five times. we could pay over then in our stride the whole large sum which it is said an indigent world gave the natural sciences last year, and tune them in to social needs as during the war, not holding them up as lord stamp suggested nay, cheering them on. of course, it is comparatively easy for science to raise funds, with the marconis selling the clark maxwells. but on social benefits, the world is still like huckleberry finn, who when he prayed for a fishing line and was told to ask only for spiritual gifts, just passed it up altogether. but even poets like tom harrison are taking up mass observation in great britain: they are going in for the trivialities. reverting to popular education, may i proffer an idea? hogbens mathematics for the million as the title anticipated is a best seller. it relegates statistics to a final chapter. but statistics needs a whole book of the kind. miss walker is splendid, but i am thinking for non statisticians. moreover, the book should show how social needs have produced the new data and methods, as westergaarde and koren have partly done. why should physics and mathematics have all the thrillers? hogben writes for fun from sick beds and railway coaches. statisticians are even busier than biologists, and even at such a price, miss walker seems it, brutal as it sounds. she will avoid some ebulliencies. at this shall i share wholeheartedly and egoistically like the oxford group? you will recall that the new atlantis was to have had a second social part. but bacon was before statistics, and the rest was not perfected. in the first enthusiasm for this paper i tried to imagine that unbuilded house of uniquely dedicate to means as much as ends: its towers and gardens; its merchants of light, compilers, interpreters and the others; at its head the father of the house who, says bacon, had an aspect as if he pitied men. i could not visualize it save in the four great rooms, statistics and research the third and fourth and most opulent, equating, synthesizing, catalyzing this world of becoming, in terms of occurrences and frequencies. but on closer view some difference developed in me between a mind to such an undertaking. i do not doubt (for we are not spenglerians) that creative vision, a rubbing of the eyes to significances in recent scientific thought, with a schema not in shackles but still a schema, is what we need. there are no greater obstacles in the way of the social sciences no more undiscovered techniques than were in the natural sciences when large brow conceived the new atlantis. first, but these will more consciously stem from political science in our new new atlantis. don marquis was once a census clerk but he did not learn from the census to make the cockroach say: i never think at all when i write nobody can do two things at the same time and do them well, for a census must think from forty angles. in any event the happy state (which will take the first perfect census, compiling it in a few weeks on the canadian machine) is assuredly the free state, deriving from that monument of freedom won in jamess reign freedom of parliamentary debate. it was once a fear of lord bryce that democratic parliaments obviously could not gauge public opinion. but to day statistics can gauge it while we wait, and at a thousandth the cost of an election. it emerges that public opinion on occasion wants incompatibles and though it is better to go wrong in freedom than right in chains, the price of going wrong is going up we bomb civilians now. this freedom has never been perdurable: greece had it and debauched it; rome had it and crushed it; kept alive by the primitive church it committed suicide in the french revolution. science, which has brought government into every walk in life, has undoubtedly increased authoritarianism, and we have returned to the age of heroes familiar, bellicose somnambulists who are not asleep one bit. two remedies have been suggested, each showing our bent statistics ward. now that the universe is finite, whether of the einstein or de sitter pattern, bertrand russell wants a census of it, for then venturous and enquiring intellects will turn to other fields, (as previously from geometry to physics) altering the whole structure of human life, since our present acquisitive society is only the reflection of our interest in physical laws.6 the alternative is closer to earth and humdrum: that the free state try and become expert, of which the first task is to distinguish good discipline from bad regulationism, by methods on which in the purely political part an ex president of our association has written a good book. the heros attitude to statistics is significant. napoleon, whose liberalism never interfered with dynastic business merely banned them publication. but the moderns have multiplied them beyond all precedent so much so, the london economist hints, that they have even statistics for themselves and statistics for giving out the splendid lie of plato with a vengeance. in these complexities and perplexities a russian statistician or two have been shot, so we have our martyrology, one hopes a hagiology. ethics. and still i have not mentioned the good, the beautiful, the true. whitehead removes the aesthetic beyond science in the realm of philosophy from whose door if we retire on tiptoe it is not without lingering looks, for science and psychology are jamming it, and statistics is not mr. worldly wiseman but everyman. of values, by their fruits ye shall know them. in ethics, for example, wherein theology, psychology and jurisprudence commingle, the new criteria of science are for our measurement: in fact we are already measuring prohibitions, whether of institutional law (crime), or of the legislator within the breast of punishment (somewhat abated of late by the abolition of hell), we still believe that knowledge of law and a desire to do right are the only expertise of a judge, and so blunder ignorantly between sentimentalism and obscurantism, but only until statistics rewrite criminology and penology. law itself in the days of the ecclesiastical polity had its seat in the bosom of god, creating vagabonds with one edict and disposing of them neatly on the gallows with another. but like the archbishop in saint joan we are less glib than we were with the name of god, (who banishes malaria on the fair condition that we liquidate the mosquito), and jurisprudence upgrows from practice and the wilderness of single instances. from the jural concept emerges free will that age old dialectic. quetelets budget of the scaffold exorcised it in vain, and the physicists argue anew the paradox of a predictable crowd and an unpredictable unit. predictability is a matter of numbers. democracy is institutions based on short lives have almost wholly collapsed. we must accommodate our eschatology to a view of the universe which leaves no room for a geographical heaven and hell. scientific ethics, by dean inge. as to international law, still wallowing in make believe, ingeminating peace in terms of war, sir alfred zimmern describes the league of nations japanese policy as a double bluff, first because based on the christian ethic has disappeared among european nations, and secondly because japan is not christian. or as senor ortega y gasset puts it, the league was a gigantic juridical machinery created for the administration of a non existent law. yet radio has brought the world within sound of a heralds voice which was aristotles limit to the size of a state: we are not a plurality of nations but a world society: and in general as someone says it should be easier to love your neighbor when you do not have to see him and five with him. if war is psychologic as well a economic, statistics will let norman angel1 distinguish the two faces. the people who do most completely what is in fact to their interest are those who, on moral grounds, do what they believe to be against their interest. we must be kind, and not leave it all to the boy scouts. best science: in its collective mind as well as physical body is the hope of a sane, orderly and progressive world. beauty. as to the beautiful, we are measuring the mechanics of its provocation and apperception, and max eastman is asking what literature will do a thousand years hence when trained investigators with statistics and laboratory findings under their bulging arms may have the last word on everything. why do the hogwash of the movies climax our present day aesthetic, and why in spite of painless dentistry do we not write poems of happiness like the jacobeans? beauty, lies beyond measurement, but he adds that it is the quality of anything relative to its end not exactly the beauty. taste and fashion, says sainte beuve, are next door neighbors, and to science after its orgy in victorianism we owe the simplicity and pur posefulness of contemporary art. as to poetry, which aristotle held to be a higher thing than history, dingle and bertrand russell make merry over lines. poetry like music does not make sense, it makes emotion: and you shall hear the herb and tree, the better heart of men shall see, shall feel celestially, as long as you crave nothing but the. if plato banished poetry for plain lies, will science banish the song? the last biographer of ruskin says his economics misfired not because they were wrong, but because ruskin was a drug addict his drug the emotive and overpowering language of the james bible.? religion. the word brings me to religion, which is not conduct, though good conduct is a necessity to the mystical experience, even of the neo mystics like aldous huxley. the conflict between religion. senor is making a statistical analysis of the perforations on player piano rolls. of any event to which the whole creation moves, says bertrand russell, a more correct description would be to which some parts of creation move while other move away from it, n adding that an emotion which can be destroyed by a little mathematics is neither very genuine nor very valuable. and dingle says that the lady of the line the stars she whispered blindly move might have been comforted by reflecting that she was not a star. and science has changed since our youth, when mr. gladstone and bob ingersoll, for example, dealt to each other across the atlantic such resounding thwacks they still resound from Tennessee. but preoccupation with revelation has turned or returned (pointed by science) to whiteheads adventure of the spirit, which in set terms is not a (curse which is the end word of the old testament meanwhile science has a new humility the humility of statistics. in the dichotomys (whose everyday bridge is in service and social ethics) curtis compares the progress of observational knowledge to a hyperbola which will never touch the two straight lines to which it is referred, though it will asymptotically come infinitely close after the lapse of unlimited time. this at least charts the paradox of the spencerian unknowable, and yet our unending quest of it, to which spencer himself relates all our progress from Caliban man still only in the making, still able to greet the unseen with a cheer of the religious in statistics. let florence nightingale, though pre war, be exemplar the passionate statistician she was called. the world, she believed, was evolved in accordance with a divine plan which it was mans business to discover. but to understand gods thoughts she held we must study statistics which thus became for her a religious duty. her religion was of works, for she was the means of establishing the first chair of statistics in an english university. darwin delivered the nineteenth century from anthropomorphism, and we have likewise survived the succeeding mechanic morphism, books like drummonds natural law in the spiritual world marking the transition. so that religion may satisfy the soul of the saint and not disgust the intellect of the scholar. hoghen has disinterred the bishop who calculated from numbers that man was created by the trinity on october the 23rd, b.c. 4004, at nine oclock in the morning, but it is idle sport: within the year the Anglican commission on doctrine has rejected both the infallibility of the scriptures and the resurrection of the physical body a far cry from the tocsin over vestiges of creation, the origin of species or even essays and reviews. truths of science are not truths but truisms: non metrical laws, the statistical and the transcendental, lie beyond. so likewise divides science from metaphysics, and both from the mystical union with god. but santayana would not call the mystical experience (including hindu yoga, buddhist dhyana, mohammedan sufism, jewish cabalism) truth. sensed better than other people what sort of thing it was desirable to do an apriorist with a sense of smell; and for certain personal qualities, as i said, even a statistician may warm to this many sided, modest man, rather born to onus than to bonus, scornful of popularity. whether or not he was prospero, he had imagination (he was a fair poet) and he had humor, both essentials of our craft. his pedantry, like ours, was better than utopianism. if he warn witches, that was a priori science scientific demonology in also he fustigated the odd heretic : persecution was still good politics and not yet bad economics (we stop a a piece of rubber hose). as peace loving as any statistician, james was always afraid that pistols would go off, nor did woodrow wilson nor neville chamberlain keep us better out of war in a europe divided as today, in the words of a witty canadian, (between nations practicing the goose step and nations practicing the side step. he even soothed the irish. history in detroit is bunk) and elsewhere she changes her mind, and i for one am glad if by late accounts james is not the two headed ass of macaulay but a civilized, intelligent man boreal but not arboreal. but i go on talking of him thus till the last late moment only because in one particular i feel his equal if i may say it in these doping days of my official life: james prized over all things his english throne, but he could exalt it no more than i do the generosity that has beckoned me at the ending of this pregnant century to be the president of the statistical association.

Pearl","1908-1939","﻿one hundred years ago a small group of men, mostly living in ornear boston, met together on november 27th to manifest their abiding faith about an undeniably queer streak in their individual biological constitutions. they seem to have been an odd lot of fish, differing widely from each other in most respects, but all alike in one. each of them had what the psychiatrists nowadays call a compulsion neurosis impelling him to tinker with numbers and fiddle with figures. their souls cried out for tabulations in the same way that the pro hibitionist of later times yearned for his daily ration of peruna. but what was more remarkable than this insatiable craving for dull data a taste that appears to happy people who can take their statistics or leave them alone, to verge on the pathological was the simple faith of the founding fathers that, once the word got around that there was a statistical association, it would grow and prosper. they somehow knew deep down in their protoplasm, that there must be a lot of other people afflicted with their special kind of numerical itch, who would come running at the chance to hold pleasant converse about the symptoms, the therapeutics, the operations, and the prognosis of their malady. how right they were! you have only to look about you to see how the pleasantest and most useful of all forms of mild insanity has grown by what it has fed on. and not only has it grown of itself but it has at the same time developed a power of infecting others that could not be better evidenced than by the magnificant array about this table of presidents of the allied social science associations, whom we delight to have with us on this occasion, and whose presence we esteem as a very great and real honor to the statistical association. it seems to me that, quite simply and genuinely, without vanity or boasting, our association has a right to be proud of what it has accom plished in the century of its existence. its long array of publications holds high rank throughout the world; its meetings have stimulated and informed the beginners at the same time that they have cheered the maturer members through their annual renewals of pleasant social 1 a condensed vernion of thi paper constituted the presidential addresa delivered at philadelphia, following the dinner held there in connection with the celebration of the centenary of the contacts and their encouragements and stimulations to keep up the good work; and finally the association’s influence through its mem bership, and particularly in recent years through its efficient and able secretary, upon the intellectual and moral standards of statistics, governmental and private, has been profoundly beneficial. and in all these, and many other respects, there has been steady progress all the time. that progress has not stopped. nor is there any sign of its stopping. on the contrary the association embarks upon its second century with renewed vitality and a broadened and deepened program that ensures still further progress and enhanced influence. biologically, continued normal growth is the sign of continuing youth. the sociologists, i understand, have deep rooted, not to say violent, objections to regarding anything like the statistical associa tion as an organism. but, be that as it may, the association, though old in calendar time, has certainly become steadily younger during these past hundred years by every important token of youth; vigor, vitality, originality, receptiveness to new ideas, and organic growth. what states and conditions this progress towards youthful attributes may reach if it keeps on in the same way for another hundred years a biolo gist finds it not only difficult but a little startling to conternplatre. but perhaps our trend line will in time begin to take on the character of an asymptotic approach to a steady state or golden era of perpetual youth, when directors will cease from troubling about budgets and secretaries will achieve a well earned rest. it is a curious paradox that while statisticians banded together in an association seem able to keep themselves, in their collective or associ ated aspect, perpetually youthful, the same can not be said of the prin cipal pabulum on which they nourish themselves. for that nourish ment derives from the sizes, movements, and other peculiarities of populations, and populations do indubitably age with the passage of time. in particular the population of the united states, from the mani fold gyrations of which the members of this association have found more grist for their statistical mills than from all other sources cornbined, has aged in several remarkable ways during the past hundred years. i should like, if you please, to devote the remainder of my remarks to a brief and all too inadequate discussion of the general subject of the aging of popu lations. it is fraught with important consequences to every one of us, individually and collectively. but before beginning its discussion it may be well to defend briefly the categorical statement that population is thejons et origo of all statistical activity. in common with all other intellectual activities of humankind there goes on in the field of statistics all the time a process of splitting into sub fields or specialties. but however intensive the specialization, and whatever its field so long as it relates to human beings and their activities, it rests at bottom on the statistics of population. try to think of financial statistics, or marketing statistics, or social statistics, or any other sort you please, completely divorced from, and with absolutely no knowledge whatso ever of, concurrent population statistics, and you see at once that in the absence of a bond with statistics of poulation the specialty would be instantly sterilized and rendered devoid of any real meaning or significance. so perhaps it is fitting that in celebrating our hundredth birthday we go “back to bach,” and talk a little about population. the division of the individual life cycle of the human organism into periods, or “ages of man,” has been a favorite diversion of poets and philosophers nearly as far back as the record goes. no pheaomenon of nature is more obvious than the cyclical character of the individual life processes. out of previous non existence the life of each individual be gins as such at some point in time. philosophically it is of no great pres ent import whether the marker of this beginning be taken as the fertilization of the egg or the visible act of birth. either may serve as a starting point. at some later time subsequent to its beginning each individual life as such comes to an end with death. between these two events the most primitive folk wisdom could not miss taking account of what man’s mammalian forebears indeed were well aware of, namely that the living individual goes through obvious states of development or progression to a prime of life, to be followed by stages of regression or involution. shakespeare, and for that matter proclus 2,000 years before him, distinguished seven stages in man’s individual life cycle. this septenary way of looking at life has been much favored in litera ture. biologically, however, it has no particular justification. the ob servations of the biologist lead him to the view that the life cycle of any mammal, including man the unique mammal, can logically and precisely be divided into only three stages that have epistemonic sig nificance. these are its pre reproductive, reproductive, and post repro ductive phases. these three phases are biologically fundamental. cor related with each of them are many other aspects of life, readily dis tinguishable, but generally less fundamentally important. thus the pre reproductive phase is also the age of man that includes infancy, and the major part of growth. the reproductive phase is also the period of full vigor and its expression in all the manifold ways that the human engine uses to let off steam. the post reproductive phase is also the period of senescence, and of the ripened wisdom that only the experi ence of living a long time can bring. but mostly these also matters are biologically secondary to the basic businesses of life; which are first get ting ready to reproduce, then reproducing, and finally just sticking around without any biological justification so far as has yet been dis covered, merely because each bearer of a vital torch hates mortally to drop out of the parade in fact absolutely refuses to so long as there is a sufficient head of steam in the boiler to turn over just once more the worn and weary engine. while the already mentioned correlates with the basic phases of the life cycle are mostly of secondary significance biologically, one of them is, however, of first rate importance, and particularly so in the case of the human animal. man’s social evolution has combined with his organic evolution to bring it about that the people in the reproductive phase of life have to do the work necessary to get not only their own livings, but also the livings of the infants and youngsters in the pre reproductive phase, and still further the major part of the livings of the old folks in the post reproductive phase. in the aggregate this puts a pretty heavy burden of work on the shoulders of a moiety of every human population that we know anything about. under the circum stances there is a certain cosmic fitness, or perhaps a manifestation of divine ,wisdom, to be observed in the fact that the biological business of reproducing is on the whole of a pleasant and relaxing nature, rather than an added burden upon those who must concurrently do most, of the world’s work. it seems odd that this thought was not em bodied in the bridgewater treatises, or other similar expositions of natural theology. a further example of providential foresight is to be found in the evident pains that were taken to make things convenient for statisti cians when the age boundaries of the three phases of the human life cycle were set by the heavenly committee on biological arrange ments. for the end of the pre reproductive phase, and the beginning of the reproductive, which occurs at puberty, happens at the age of about 15 years as an average for mankind as a whole, as nearly as may be determined the end of the reproductive phase of the cycle, marked by the menopause in females, and by so small an amount of subsequent reproducing in the male as to be statistically insignificant in spite of a good deal of senile boasting and occasional individual exceptions to the rule, occurs on the average at a point sufficiently near to a calendar age of 50 years so that no error of any moment will be made by taking it at that as a round figure.3 so then if we classify human population counts into a three fold age grouping, in which the three classes are, in order,14 years inclusive; 15 49 years inclusive; and 50 years and above, we shall have allocated the population in substantial accord with the fundamental biological divisions of each individual human be ing’s life cycle from birth to death. the eminent swedish statistician sundbarg seems to have been the first to appreciate the significance and some of the biological implications of this age classification of human populations. he noted that in virtually all populations just about 50 percent of all the people fell in the 15 49 year age class, that is to say, in the reproducer worker phase of the life cycle. this observation has been confirmed by all sub sequent students of the matter. the proportionate numbers in the pre reproductive or post reproductive phases (the14 years and 50 years and over age classes) are found to vary more widely, on thc whole, from population to population, and in a compensatory way. thus a population like that of india in 1931 had 39.9 percent in the pre repro ductive phase with ages below 15 years; 50.4 percent in the repro ductive phase with ages between 15 and 50 years; and only 9.7 percent in the post reproductive phase with ages of 50 years and above. in the same year 1931, by way of contrast] the population of france had only a little more than half as high a proportion (22.9 percent to be exact) of its citizens in the pre reproductive phase; about the same proportion (51.4 percent) in the reproductive phase; and almost three times as great a proportion (25.7 percent) in the post reproductive phase. it needs no elaborate argument or added documentation to make it clear that from a biological point of view the populations of india and france are widely and deeply differentiated, one from the other. table 1 shows the percentage distributions of the populations of some 50 countries at the most recent dates for which data were avail able in accessible sources, according to the three fold division of the life cycle. the countries are arranged in the table in descending order of the percentage in the pre reproductive phase (0 14 years). again the natural history of population summarise the most reliable data on age at menopause, and finds an inter group mean for this character of 46.38f 23 yearn, and an inter group median of 46. sundbarg proposed to classify populations into ""progressive,"" ""stationary"" or ""stagnant,"" and ""regressive"" types, on the basis of their percentage distribution in the three age classes. the progressive type had, by his definition, 40 percent or more in the pre reproductive (0 14 years) phase; 50 percent in the reproducer worker phase (be tween 15 and 50 years of age) and 10 percent or fewer in the post reproductive phase (50 years and over). for the stagnant type the cor responding percentages were 33 50 17, and for the regressive type 20 (or fewer) 50 30 (or more). the concept and the descriptive terms for the types obviously referred to purely biological or reproductive progression, stagnation, or regression. surely in no other sense than the biological would any social philosopher be likely to regard the popula tions of brazil, honduras, cuba, and turkey, as either the only pro gressive (they alone in table 1 had 40 percent or more in the pre reproductive phase), or the most progressive populations in the world today. but quite apart from sundbarg's purely formal and somewhat sterile classification it is plain that the status of any population at a given moment, relative to the proportions of its component members falling in the three biological phases of the life cycle, may have an important and direct bearing upon the aggregate or composite behavior of that population, and upon the probable course and outcome of any enter prises upon which it may embark as a whole. of all the forms of ag gregate behavior in which a population may become involved war is surely one of the most significant as well as dreadful. let us consider for a moment the condition of the populations of the chief protagonists shortly before they embarked in 1914 upon world war i, and similarly before they started early last september upon world war 11. the nec essary data are lacking to make this suggested picture absolutely pre cise, complete, or accurate, nor will it be necessary to bore you with an analysis made as elaborate as possible for the sake of the last iota of comprehensiveness. a simpler approach will sufficiently indicate the outlines and broad coloring of the picture. in 1914 within a few days of the outbreak of hostilities, germany, with only austria as an ally of any degree of effectiveness, found herself immediately confronted by france, england and wales, scotland, belgium, and russia. let us agree to leave russia out of the picture, except for certain overtones presently to be struck. there are two pragmatic reasons for treating russia in this cavalier fashion; the first is that anything like trust worthy figures for the age distribution of the russian population at a reasonably short time before 1914 are not available in any sources at my command; the second is that the subsequent course of events indicated that russia played an effective part in the course of war for only a short time. in a similar way we shall not include in the figuring the population resources of the outlying parts of the british empire, or of those other countries that eventually rallied around the allies before world war i came to an end. let us confine attention solely to the immediate military impact of the chief combatants at the very outbreak of the war. the nearest population figures are those of 1910 and 1911. as of those dates germany and austria had total population resources, counting both sexes together, of upwards of 64 million persons, of whom approximately 33.5 percent were youngsters in the pre reproductive phase of life under 15 years of age; 50.8 percent were workers aged between 15 and 50 years on whom fell the com bined burdens of fighting and of producing the goods to keep both the troops and the civilian population alive and going; and 15.7 percent were over 50 years of age. if we consider the male population only, up wards of 16 million, or 51.3 percent of them were in the group between 15 and 50 years, with 34.1 percent in the under 15 group, and only 14.7 percent in the 50 and over group. as of the same date the four instantaneous and immediate allies that are to be considered, belgium, france, england and wales, and scotland had total population resources, counting both sexes, of up wards of 87.5 millions, a clear numerical advantage in total over the enemy of nearly 37 percent, not counting russia or later ralliers around at all. furthermore approximately 52.2 of this combined popu lation fell in the fighter worker age phase between 15 and 50, as against the corresponding 50.8 percent in the population resources controlled by germany, another clear advantage. this difference of only 1.4 percent may seem too small to pay attention to, but it was a difference that was more than 200 times its probable error, and represented an absolute advantage in this age phase of nearly 3 million persons. in the under 15 phase of the life cycle the combined allied population had about 28.5 percent of the total, and in the 50 and over phase about 19.2 percent. we shall not stop to argue over the comparative advan tages or disadvantages of the distribution of these outlier phases, but instead may consider, just for a moment, the combined allied male population only. again neglecting russia, it amounted to upwards of 43 million against about 32 million for germany and austria, a relative advantage of 34 percent. of its components 52.4 percent fell in the fighter worker phase between 15 and 50 years of age, as against 51.3 percent in the german controlled population resources. altogether there can be no question that at the outbreak of world war i the size and structure of the combined population resources of the imniediate allies were definitely more advantageous than those then con trolled by the germans. what now of the situation at the outbreak of world war ii? again russia will be omitted fxom all consideration, because up to the time of writing anything like direct military aid from russia to germany in the latter’s war with the allied forces has been chiefly notable for its absence. poland also is best left out of the military reckoning for an other and sadder reason. so we are left with france, england and wales, and scotland on one side, and germany (which in august 1939 included austria as a part of itself) and czechoslovakia on the other side. it seems fair to count in the czechoslovakian man power for the pragmatic reason that at the outstart of world war i1 germany had re ceived for nearly a year, and was then receiving, direct and important military advantages from her virtually complete control of it. before proceeding further with the discussion it must be called to mind that in the quarter of a century that elapsed between the begin ning of world wars i and 11, the populations of all the countries involved had increased in absolute size, by normal processes of growth. furthermore, as will presently be seen, they had changed in their age structure by significant amounts, as a result of the operation of differ ential birth and death rates in the interval. so then, taking figures as of roughly 1937 and 1938, it appears that the allies went to battle last september with total population re sources, counting both sexes, of a little more than 87 million persons. but now more than one quarter of them, as against the 19 percent of 25 years ago, were in the post reproductive phase of life aged 50 and over. furthermore, instead of the 52.2 percent of fighters and workers be tween 15 and 50 there were only 51.3 percent in this phase; almost one in a hundred fewer. finally, instead of 28.5 percent of youngsters coming along there were only 23.6 percent. the population resources controlled by germany in early september of this year present a different picture. she had a total of approximately 90 million persons to draw on. in this respect the advantage was with her this time, to the tune of only 3.4 percent to be sure, but in great contrast to an advantage of 37 percent in the other fellow’s favor 25 years ago. the age distribution of this population was different too. of its component members 53.7 percent, as against the allies 51.3 percent, were in the worker fighter phase of the life cycle. again a little difference of 2.4 percent may not seem to amount to much, but it is enormously greater than any chance fluctuation of sampling that could be expected, and in fact represents an advantage of more than 3.6 millions of persons in the fighter worker phase, of whom a little fewer than a half are males. of the semi dependent old folks there were but 22.4 percent in the german set up against the allies 25.2 percent. in respect of the youngsters under 15 germany was on all fours with the allies, having 23.8 percent in this phase as against 23.6 for the allied populations. it is not worth taking time to discuss separately the male portions of the compared populations, since that analysis yields noth ing to alter essentially the picture given by the total. the statistical computation has been carried quite far enough to make it perfectly plain that, so far as the population aspects of war are concerned, the absolute and relative advantages and disadvantages accruing from that source have become reversed in the quarter of a cen tury separating these two great conflicts between essentially the same combatants. generally falling birth rates on one side, and generally rising birth rates in considerable parts of the populations concerned on the other side have been in the main responsible for this substantial alteration of the picture. it is now time to give some attention to the question of what the population of the united states has been doing during the hundred years in which the statistical association has at least kept a wotchful eye upon it, even though not able to do much more than that, and particularly not quite powerful enough to control its movements. unfortunately, it is not possible to make penetrating comparisons in respect of age distributions between the population of this country aa it was in 1830 and a hundred years later in 1930, aa we should like to, because the census of 1830 left a good deal to be desired in the way of information about the ages of the inhabitants. so the best that can be done from the standpoint of this discussion is to compare the total 'free white"" population in 1840 with the total white population of 1930, for such separate divisions (stste or territories) as had official existence in 1840. there were 30 such political subdivisions in 1840. twentyeight of these units had in 1840 the same boundaries that they have today for all practical purposes; two out of the 30, namely wisconsin ter ritory and iowa territory as they were called in 1840, included much larger areas than they do now as states. the boundaries of the former took in a part of what is now minnesota,and the latter included, besides its present territory large parts of present day minnesota, and north and south dakota. it is further to be noted, before proceeding further with this discussion, that the standards of accuracy and completeness in census taking were not as high in 1840 as they have since become. but, again except possibly for wisconsin and iowa, internal evidence indicates that no serious errors of inference are likely to arise in the use it is proposed to make of the figures here. the available data for the comparison of the populations of these 30 states (and territories) in 1840 and 1930 present such a great number of glittering facets for discussion as to raise the dyed in the wool stat istician to the seventh heaven of delight. but in the brief remainder of time left for this discourse it will be possible to say something about only two of these manifold aspects. the first will relate to the compara tive reproductive performances of the white population a hundred years ago and in 1930. for the purposes of this discussion let us con sider for a moment the ratio between (a) the number of persons in a population falling in the pre reproductive phase of life (cl14 years), which may be called the generate of the population, on the one hand; and ( b ) the number of persons in the same population at the same time (say the year of a census) falling in the reproductive phase of life (15 49 years), which may be called the generant of the population, on the other hand. if the former of these numbers is divided by. the latter and the quotient is multiplied by 1,000, the resulting answer will state the number of persons in the pre reproductive phase of life in that population for each thousand persons in the reproductive phase at the same time. this ratio, which may perhaps be fittingly called the generative of the population, is biologically significant. its meaning may perhaps be most clearly envisaged if we think for a moment of a population as contained in three great tanks, set one above the other the topmost tank, set on a high scaffolding, is filled to a certain level with the persons in the pre reproductive phase of life. at its bottom is an age outlet pipe through which trickles a constant flow of fully mat urated larvae, as it were, who, having achieved puberty, pass down the pipe into the next lower tank, which is filled to a certain level with the reproducers. from this second tank there are two pipes. one of these runs upward and over the top of the first tank into which it empties. through this pipe flows the stream of new births which the reproducera pump up to maintain the level of the first, or pre reproductive phase tank. a second pipe from the reproducer tank leads off from the bot tom down into the third tank in the series, which rests on the ground. through this pipe flows the stream of those who, having 5nished their 288 statistical association reproducing, pass on down to the third or post reproductive tank. at the bottom of that final tank there is only one outlet. it is a broad and shrouded spillway, labelled death, and all eventually slip through it to the earth from which they came, and on which the system of tanks rests. both of the two higher tanks also have death drainways, to be sure, in addition to their other outlets. but these are much smaller ones and let out fewer persons than the regular age outlets. diagram to illustrate the more important of the fundamental variables in the biological dynamics of populations. for further explanation see text. now what our generative index measures is the height of the level of the topmost or pre reproductive phase tank, that the persons in the second or reproducer tank are able to maintain by their reproductive efforts, with the death drainways in both always open as well as the age outlet pipes. table 2 gives, for the white populations of 1840 and 1930, the gen erative indices state by state, at those two dates, together with the absolute numbers from which the indices are computed (namely the populations in the pre reproductive and the reproductive phases of the entries in the table are arranged in descending order of the generative index as it was in 1840. among the 30 political subdivisions of the united states that existed in both 1840 and 1930 there were 11 which in 1840 had generative in dices with values greater than 1,000, meaning that in these 11 states there were more than 1,000 persons in the pre reproductive phase of life for each 1,000 in the reproductive phase. these states ranged from tennessee with a generative index in 1840 of 1,175 to south carolina, whose generative index in 1840 was 1,002. between these extremes fell, in descending order of the index, alabama, georgia, indiana, arkansas, mississippi, missouri, kentucky, north carolina, and illinois, these 11 states were certainly doing their reproductive duties to the nation in a big way back in 1840. they were turning out prospective presidents and senators, as well as schoolmarms and share croppers at a stupen dous rate. and may i again remind you that it is solely of the free white population of that day that we are speaking? the negro does not enter the picture being drawn at all. in 1930 there was not a single state in the union with a population having a generative index as great as 1000. the state whose white popu ation had the highest index in 1930 was north carolina, and the value of the index was 745. so are the mighty fallen! the states with the next highest generative indices for the white portion of the population in 1930, that were also present and reproducing as well as voting in 1840, arranged in descending order according to the 1930 value of the index, were south carolina, kentucky, alabama, arkansas, mississippi, tennessee, georgia, virginia, louisiana, and finally maine with an index of 597 in 1930. so then it appears that among the 30 political subdivisions that had a census of the free white population taken in 1840 as either states or territories, 8 out of the 11 that had the highest generative indices in 1840 were among the 11 with the highest indices in 1930. three that were in the 11 highest in 1840 (namely indiana, missouri, and illinois) were replaced in 1930 by virginia, louisiana, and maine. truly one is again reminded of the profound wisdom of malthus when he said that “the passion between the sexes is necessary, and will remain nearly in its present state. ” when one reflects that the white populations of tennessee, alabama, georgia, arkansas, missis sippi, kentucky, and the carolinas were among the 11 showing the highest generative indices in 1930 just as they were in 1840, it seems plain that “the passion between the sexes” in those populations had in deed experienced little relative alteration in the period.‘ but perhaps some may be disposed to think that this record of secular perseverance in concupiscence found in the most vigorously re productive population groups is perhaps after all only ac cidental. so let us next have a look at the 10 states that in 1840 showed 4 it ia to be understood olearly that the above comparisons are based upon the 30 ssstates that were represented in therecoda in both 1840 and 1930. in 1930 the white populations with the highest among were, in descending order: north carolina. west virginia. south carolina. kentuoky, alabama, utah, arkanass, new mexico, mississippi. tenneesee, and north dakota. but in 1840 west virginia, utah, new mexico and north dakota did not exiat as suoh. the lowest generative indices, and then see how they stood in 1930. in 1840 the political subdivision with the lowest generative index for its free white population was wisconsin territory, but it was at that time populated chiefly by pioneering migrants from the east and south, who had not been there long enough to bring about anythinglike a settled or normal age distribution. furthermore there is reason to be lieve that the 1840 census was particularly inadequate in that terri tory. on these accounts it will probably be better to fix attention upon massachusetts, as the state with a stabilized population having the lowest generative index in 1840, with a value of 631; that is to say 631 persons in the pre reproductive phase of the life cycle to each 1,000 in the reproductive phase. the next lowest was rhode island (666)) and then in order connecticut, district of columbia, new hampshire, louisiana, florida, new york, maryland, and finally as the tenth in the list vermont, whose generative index in 1840 was 809. in 1930 the list of 10 states with the lowest generative indices for the white popu lation out of the 30 states that can be compared over the period, starts with the district of columbia, whose index was only 340. next was new york (444)) followed in order by illinois, new jersey, massachu setts, missouri, delaware, connecticut, ohio, and ending with mary land, whose index for the white population was 525. again it develops that five out of the 10 states (district of columbia, new york, massa chusetts, connecticut and maryland) appear on both the 1840 and 1930 lists. whatever may have been the causes that led the white population of these five states to be at the bottom of the scale in 1840 in the matter of effective reproduction, and quite regardless of the social, economic, and other changes that took place in the scene between 1840 and 1930, the striking fact is that these same states turned up again in 1930 at or near the bottom of the list.6 up to this point the discussion has been of the relative ranks of the most vigorously and the least vigorously reproducing white popula tions in respect to their generative indice8 in 1840 and 1930. for all of the states without exception there was a decline in the absolute values of the generative indices between these two dates. perhaps the best indication, in broad outline, of how great this decline was can be given by comparing the combined index for the 30 states (and territories) in 1840 for which data existed, with its value for the same states in 1930. 8 again, as bafore, it must be emphasized that the above comparison relates only to states represented in the figure in both 1840 and 1930. taking into amount all 48 states and the disctict of columbia, the 10 with the lowest generative index in 1930 were, in order, district of columbia (340), california (376). nevada (423), new york (444). oregon (449). washington (462), illinois (48% new jersey (488), massachusetts (500), and arizona (608). but in 1840 there were no data for california, nevada, owon, washington, or arizona. in 1840 the total white population of these 30 subdivisions of the united states had 6,808,264 persons in the reproductive phase of the life cycle (15 49 years old), and 6,201,219 persons in the pre reproduc tive phase, leading to a generative index of 911. the white populations of the same subdivisions in 1930 had 44,134,796 persons in the repro ductive phase of life (or about 6.5 times as many as in 1840). but in the pre reproductive phase of life there were in the 1930 white popula tion only 24,014,913 persons, or fewer than 4 times as many as in 1840. vermont actually had absolutely more persons in the pre reproductive phase in her population in 1840 than she had in 1930. the 1930 gen erative index for these combined white populations was only 544, not quite 60 percent of the value of 911 displayed in 1840. the greatest de cline in the index in the 90 year period was exhibited by the white population of indiana, where it fell from 1,122 in 1840 to 543 in 1930, or 579 points. the smallest decline was in wisconsin, from 619 in 1840 to 551 in 1930, or only 68 points. this, however, is not quite fair, because, as has already been noted, in 1840 the territory that was later to become the state of wisconsin was only sparsely settled with a population having an abnormal age distribution for the time. actually its generative index did not become stabilized until 1860 at about 897 where it stayed through the 1870 census. leaving wisconsin out on this account, the state showing the next smallest decline in the white population index between 1840 and 1930 was louisiana, where it fell 117 points from 749 to 632. let us now turn to a brief examination of some of the facts about the comparative proportion of persons in the post reproductive phase of the life cycle the oldsters who have slid down into the bottom one of our three tanks. it needs no emphasis or elaboration to make it clear that these persons, who have worked out and finished whatever poten tial biological justification there ever was for their existence, constitute a social problem of the first magnitude in all present day populations of the western world. as before attention will be confined to the white population only, and to the 30 political subdivisions of the united states that can be compared in 1840 and 1930. table 3 gives the percentages of the per sons aged 50 years and over, in the white populations of 1840 and 1930. among all of the populations shown in table 3 new hampshire’s showed the highest percentage of old folks in 1840 and also in 1930. that percentage was 14.4 in 1840 and 24.3 in 1930. furthermore this centenary celebration 293 latter percentage was the highest shown by any of the 48 states and the district of columbia in 1930. all six of the new england states in 1840 had between 10 and 14.4 percent of their white populations in the post reproductive phase. but no other state did at that time. 1930 nine of the 30 states under comparison found 20 percent one fifth or more of their populations in this phase. furthermore each of the three pacific coast states, washington, oregon, and california, not represented in 1840, also had more than 20 percent of its population in this phase. the state that showed the greatest increase in the propor tion of old folks between 1840 and 1930 was iowa, which as a pioneering 294 statistical association. territory had only 4.18 percent of its population in this phase a cen tury ago, according to the somewhat imperfect record, but in 1930 had 20.71 percent, approximately a five fold apparent relative increase. on the other hand the state that showed the smallest increase in the percentage between 1840 and 1930 for the white population was north carolina, which had 8.8 percent in 1940 and only 12.9 percent in 1930. south carolina behaved in practically the same way, increasing from 8.2 percent to only 12.9. this latter percentage was the lowest for the entire united states in 1930. the weighted average for all 30 states compared was 8.31 percent in 1840, and more than twice as much (17.85 percent) in 1930. a great deal is heard today about the growing burden thrown upon our social structure and way of life to take care of the old. their num bers, both absolute and relative, have steadily increased during the last century, as we have seen. a primary causal factor in bringing about this increase haa been the truly magnificent achievements of public health efforts. with drastic reductions in the ghastly mortality in the pre reproductive phase of life that prevailed a century ago many more people have been able to live on into the post reproductive phase. furthermore no social trend could be more obvious than the increas ingly vocal demands of the old folks that they be adequately taken care of when they are in that terminal phase of their earthly career. the tectonics of our kind of democracy obviously favor such demands, and encourage their perennial growth. the wisdom of the founding fathers led them to the view that youngsters under 21 years of age were, on the whole, too foolish to be entrusted with the power of the vote. but not having envisaged the possibility of such weird economic philosophies as those currently associated with “ham and eggs” or “$200 a month” it apparently never occurred to them that there might conceivably be an age beyond which people would also be too foolish to be allowed to vote. but along with the increase in the proportions of the population in the post reproductive phase, and indeed partly responsible for it sta tistically, there has been a decline in the birth rate and a consequent decrease in the proportion of the population in the pre reproductive phase, from 43.70 percent in 1840 to 28.95 percent in 1930, again for the 30 states that can be compared at the two dates specified. so there has been some compensation for the increasing old age burden on those who must do the population’s work through a lightening of the relative burden of infancy and youth that must be cared for. at the same time government has again stepped in and insisted, through child labor legislation, that society must assume the total support of children up to the comparatively advanced age of 18 years. while to be sure the constitutional amendment to this end has not yet been ratified, there seems every reason to believe that the political strategy being used to bring about that result will presently achieve complete success. when it does we shall present to the world the bizarre picture of a great nation affirming in its laws that a human being is a helpless infant in capable of doing gainful work to help towards it support until well past the age of 18 years, and by the might of the law must be prevented from so doing; while at the same time the laws of many of the constitu ent states of the nation with equal solemnity affirm that this same “infant” may legally marry and produce offspring for several years before reaching the age of 18. truly, as has so often been observed, we are a remarkable people. but we must get back to our mutton. it is plain that the old folks, on the one hand, and the youngsters, on the other hand, by their own lusty bellowings and the supplementary skullduggery of their “humanitarian” friends are ganging up, as the expressive phrase goes, on the half of the population that does the work, pays the bills and taxes, and in cold fact earns the livings for all. what we want to know is how the burden borne by this always harassed moiety compared in total in 1930, counting both young and old into the load, to what it was in 1840. the answer is simple, and will perhaps prove a little surprising. in 1840 there were, in the 30 states that can be compared, 7,380,831 persons in the pre reproductive and post reproductive phases of life taken together. to take care of them there were 6,808,264 persons in the reproducer worker phase. so that a century ago each 1,000 workers aged between 15 and 50 years, had 1,084 other persons, younger and older, besides themselves to take care of, and in the main earn the livings for. in 1930, on the other hand,each 1,000of the 44,134,796 workers in the reproducer worker phase of life, had only 880 persons be sides themselves to take care of, out of the total of 38,826,524 persons in the pre reproductive and post reproductive phases of life combined. in short, the total burden has lessened by something of the order of a fifth of its initial magnitude in the course of a century. to the biologist this clear cut end result that emerges from the complex tangle of social, economic, and political forces, as well as underlying biological variables that are involved in its causation, appears primarily to be a striking example of adaptation of the human species qua species. as has been discussed elsewhere in detail: the population of the world increased nearly five fold in the three centuries between roughly 1630 and 1930. this extraordinary spurt of population growth in such a relatively small fraction of the vast total span of time during which man has existed as a distinct species on the earth has been pri marily a consequcnce of the casier ways of getting a living that followed the spectacular advances of pure and applied science, giving man a power to turn the forces and resources of nature to his own ends un dreamed of before. but an average density of more than 40 persons per square mile of land area of the earth, counting in every single square foot of land, is so great as to lead to discomfort, unrest, and recurring disturbances. already a century ago there had begun adap tive responses of populations in the attempt to mitigate the discomfort arising from the painful stimuli induced by high population densities. one of the chief of these adaptive responses, and one which has increased enormously as everyone knows, is the practice of contraception. by this device it is easier and pleasanter by far to reduce the burden on those in the reproducer worker phase of the life cycle by cutting down the numbers in the pre reproductive phase, than it is to lighten the load by lopping off those in the post reproductive phase of life. in fact any conceivable technique to reduce the numbers in the post repro ductive phase would be completely repugnant to the moral and ethical ideas of western civilizations, to say nothing of others. it may be counted bs certain that mankind will continue and increase its adaptive efforts to make life easier and pleasanter. that is, in fact, the way of all living things. man’s whole history is the record of a long struggle, partly by the trial and error process, and partly by the exer cise of intelligence, to find easier and pleasanter ways of getting a living. the ethnologist’s records of the evolutionary progression of culture patterns point this as the prime motive and moral of the story, with a culmination in the industrial commercial culture pattern that enables enormously larger populations to live in a specified area with far less expenditure of physical effort than under any preceding mode of life. that relatively easy and pleasant living is a desirable end in itself, surely no one but the most spiritually constipated misanthrope would deny. but the adaptive processes by which this end is achieved always want careful watching. for the results of the science of biology and paleontology indicate clearly that the chief characteristic of biological adaptation is opportunism rather than wisdom. in their adaptive efforts to get out of unpleasant and painful situations living things gen erally, just like the unfortunate ladies of song and story, tend to take uthe easiest way.” all too often in the long history of life on the earth centenary celebration 297 this pathway, so pleasant temporarily, has led only to the extinction of the species at the end. those adaptations that both natural theologians and biologists agree in regarding as perfect paradigms of wisdom, di vine or just biological as the case may be, may perhaps all be really only the naturally selected cases where the opportunism of the moment the easiest way happened by pure chance alone to be also the wisest course in the long run. the cases where this perfect one to one failed to be present are not now observed,for the simple reason that they are no longer here to be observed. the current use of such devices as contraception (or, for that matter, capitalism or communism) as adaptive procedures to case the burden on aging populations may well be scrutinized from this point of view. just possibly what mankind is slowly but stcadily doing may tu rn out in the long run to be the moral equivalent of curing a toothache by the effective but disastrous technique of cutting off the patient’s head. there is no good in making life easier if there is not going to be any body around to live it. the advancement of science, and, indeed of knowledge generally, represents biologically the most colossal and in tricate adaptive procedure ever achieved by any organism. but has it brought collective wisdom in its train? the sorry state of the world to day, and all history, too, make it crystal clear that the realistic answer must be an emphatic no. nor is there any smallest reason to suppose that statesmen or politicians are going to guide our destinies in the future any more wisely than they have in the past. perhaps it may turn out to be the principal opportunity and duty of the statistical association, in the next century of its exist ence upon which it is now so auspiciously entering, to instil clearly and deeply into the minds and consciences of the mass of our people that their chiefest concern is the composition of the population.

Leslie Hayford","1940-1969","﻿the elevation of standards of statistical work in this country has long been regarded as one of the major objectives of the statistical association. from time to time proposals have been made that as a means to that end the association classify and grade its mem bers, so that even he who runs may read how good any given statisti cian is, and what degree of professional standing he is entitled to. i amskeptical of the efficacy of such measures. “a basic difficulty,” as was pointed out some years ago by a committee on association policy, “lies in the fact that quality in statistical work is vital, and exceedingly difficult to measure in its various manifestations quantitative measurements (such as years of training or experience, publications, etc.) often seriously fail to reflect vital differences in quality. it would be a disservice to the profession if ratings promoted the advancement of the less fit, and it would be exceedingly difficult to furnish depend able ratings on the basis of quality.” another difficulty, perhaps no less basic, is our inability satisfac torily to answer the question, what is a statistician? for statisticians cannot easily be described with exactness. they are not, as some writer erroneously said of the methodists, “one people;” they are many kinds of people. this makes it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, so to define and classify them as to make feasible a separation into appropri ate grades and classes, neatly labeled and certified for quality and content. books on statistics, even textbooks, give us little help. they are concerned with matters of statistical design, engineering, and pro duction; with statistical raw materials, processes, and finished prod ucts; instead of with what might be called “personnel problems.’’ but if, as has been aptly said, “fundamentally, statistics is a mode of thought,” might it not be well to consider the statistician as emerson looked upon the scholar as man thinking? viewing him thus, what shall we say of his functions and characteristics? one of those aphorisms which states a general truth imperfectly is that a statistician is one who is versed in handling mass data. this says both too little and too much; it leaves us still in ignorance as to the es sential manner of such “handling.” the variety of places in which we find persons dealing with statistics, and the range of views that are held regarding them, have doubtless added to the difficulty of saying what in fact statisticians are. they have long been much belittled and much overrated. by some they are looked upon as mere dull dissectors of dead records; and by others as brilliant geniuses whose mathematic magic enables them to discover laws and even to penetrate the future. they have become indispensable in the physical, biological and social sciences; fixtures in government; invaluable to all who have axes to grind (which causes them to be seen on both sides of controversial fences). they are thought capable of proving and disproving anything. and they are sometimes inclined to believe themselves, if only given a real chance, better able to run businesses than the business men who persist in being so blind to their capacities. they are regarded with sus picion, with pity, with admiration, and even with awe. they are lauded, quoted as authorities, damned, and made the subject of ancient jokes. they are not only little understood by others; they insufficiently understand themselves. it is high time for them to examine their vari ous aspects and conditionings, and say what place in the world they propose to fill. the most obvious, and indeed the basic functions of a statistician constitute a trinity, with each part of which he cannot fail to concern himself. they are the assembling of numerical data, their analysis, and the interpretation of the results of such analysis. it often happens, in the division of labor resulting from a highly organized society, that not all of these three functions will be, or can be, performed by the same person. this, while making possible a greater quantity of output, has its disadvantages and dangers, and doubtless causes a good deal of bad statistical product. it is apparent when one thinks about it, though in practice it is sometimes overlooked, that those who assemble data ought to have some idea of the purpose for which the data are being assembled; for the methods of collection which are appropriate for one purpose may be quite inappropriate for another. it is important, too, that those who analyze statistics should know the nature of the data, their sources, and the methods used in their collection. it also would be well for those engaged in such analysis to know just why they are thus engaged, and to concern themselves somewhat with the possible interpretations that may be put on their results. and those who interpret statistical analyses should know something of the methods of the analy ses and of the data used, if they would safeguard themselves against reaching wrong conclusions. the user of statistical data which he himself has not assembled may be left in ignorance of the reliability of their sources, the care or lack of care with which they have been collected and arranged, or even of their exact meaning. under such conditions of production of his raw material, the statistician, as man thinking, will be fully conscious of the dangers to which he is subjected) and will not rely too implicitly upon his mathematics to produce for him a dependable finished prod uct. now will be the time for him to bear in mind that warning in eldertons’ primer of statistics which is sometimes forgotten in the enthusiasm of “handling” data, namely, that ‘‘ no amount of knowledge of refined statistical methods can ever give value to statistics that have been collected on an unsound plan.” the dependence of accurate sta tistical data on precise definition) and on strict adherence to such defi nition in the assembling of the data, is too little stressed by many writers on statistics and even by some statistics gathering agencies. this is unfortunate, because it adds to the difficulties of the statis tician’s self education. he will have to learn, in some fashion, to be always careful to assure himself of the meaning and the quality of the data he uses, constantly remembering, as robert e. chaddock has warned him, that figures do not necessarily tell the truth, and that “it is never safe for purposes of comparison to accept published statistics at their face value without careful scrutiny of their limitations.” we cannot overlook the fact that users of statistics, statisticians as well as others, are constantly in danger of contamination from the pernicious notion in general circulation that the greater the quantity of numerical data that is made available the more we shall know about the world we live in. an inexcusable amount of error has been let ioose upon the world because faulty, misleading, or downright false data, by reason of their neat tabulation or their publication in a govern ment report, have been taken at face value. and if, as i suspect, preparation for what is euphemistically called national defense gen erates a new statistical fever, some level headed statisticians men thinking will be needed to keep statistically naive enthusiasts from confusing ships with shoes and sealing wax and kings. quality control of statistical raw material is going to be especially important in the present crisis. the analytical function of the statistician is perhaps too well under stood to require elaboration. that is where he chiefly glories in the exercise of his technical proficiency. it is there that his grasp of the mathematics of the new statistics will set him apart from his less expert fellow men. to be sure, he may at times, in his enthusiasm for form, somewhat neglect appropriateness of manner or of matter. in his higher state, however, he will criticise himself at every step, and by insistence on maintaining a rigid scientific skepticism avoid the pitfalls of trusting either his data or his mathematics too implicitly. in his less sophisti cated state, before he is well seasoned, he may perhaps rashly risk his reputation by too great dependence on the slender reed of methodology and by giving too loyal allegiance to the doctrine that by formulas all things are possible, even the purification of tainted data. but that will be but a passing phase in his education, from which he will eventually emerge, perhaps battle scarred, but wiser. and having emerged, he will listen again, and more attentively, to the professors, who before had seemed to be talking mostly about the mechanics of the trade. he will be inclined to agree with horace secrist that accurate knowledge of the statistical units used is quite essential; with martin f. fritz that “statistical manipulation cannot be expected to make up for bad sampling,” with jerome b. cohen that “the continuous application of a large measure of common sense, caution and reasoning skepticism is by far the safest bulwark against error;” and with george w. snede cor that “you cannot master statistics without practice.” although it is in his analytical function that the statistician finds his most stimulating exercise, it is by his interpretation of the results of his analysis that he is likely to become most popularly known. it is through this interpretative function that he is supposed to arrive at answers, solve problems, discover “laws,” and make prophecies. except perhaps for the mathematical statistician, whose greatest contribution to statistics is said to be the development of theory and the devising of methods of analysis, interpretation is the goal at which the statistician’s work is aimed. in the assembling and analysis of statistical data a thorough knowledge of the field in which one works is necessary. back of all the figures are things or persons, about which the statistician must have something more than a smattering of knowledge. but in interpretation in drawing inferences from statistics this necessity is sometimes disregarded. thus pseudo statisticians often come to strange conclusions. the varieties of faulty inference, with some indication of their causes, are sufficiently touched upon in professor cohen’s article entitled the misuse of statistics in this journal for december 1938, to call for no discussion here. the expert statistician, of course, makes no such errors. he has been trained to question not only all his data, but every step of his analysis, and he views his every interpretation with as skeptical a scrutiny as though it were the work of his least respected fellow statistician. even when he slips into prophecy or forecasting, as it is commonly called in the field of business he will protect his scientific soul by pointing out that statistics alone are not a sufficient basis for prophesying, and that he has had to make certain assumptions which time may prove unwarranted. it is by this trinity of functions the assembling, analysis, and inter pretation of numerical data that the statistician is chiefly recognized. but he has another office, essential to the most useful exercise of the other three; he must in some fashion be an author, a user of words as well as mathematics. it is here that difficulties will be met, compared with which those of statistical techniques will at times seem trifling, at least to his readers. the difficulties arise not only from what sir francis galton called “the uncouth words” used in modern statistical descrip tion, but also from the failure of the courses which the statistician took at the university to reach quite this requirement of his work, although, to be sure, they drilled him in the jargon of the trade. perhaps it would be hypercritical to say, with sir arthur quiller couch, that jargon is “flaccid writing to which flaccid thought instinctively resorts;” but one wonders now and then what would happen to statistics if every statisti cian should strive half as hard to learn the use of language as he has striven to learn the use of formulas. unfortunately, there will always be amateurs, or mere writers, who will seek to popularize the results of the statistician’s work, and who in so doing will gild many a statisti cal lily. with their more facile writing and less careful thinking, and free of the inhibitions of the scientific attitude, they may so distort, or deliberately misuse and falsify, the statistician’s work that a flood of lies will be put into circulation, for which the innocent statistician himself may get all the blame. eventually, perhaps, this may force the statisti cian, in self defense, to the intensive cultivation of the art of using language to reveal more clearly to others the secrets he goes to so much pains to discover for himself. it is not without significance that one of the sessions of this year’s annual meeting of the statistical association is being devoted to a discussion of what is described as “principles and procedures for putting across business statistics reports.” the implica tion is salutary that in the field of business, at least, something must be done better to bridge the chasm between the makers and the desired users of statistical reports. i have said little, and that but indirectly, about the causes of st,atisti cians. in the beginning, before statistics had become so popular as now, it is quite probable that numerical data were sought and used almost wholly because communities and individuals had a strong desire to know more about themselves and the world they lived in. doubtless even then, however, there were some who sensed the value of statistics as means of supporting their sides of arguments and of justifying their actims or proposals. in later years the sciences, physical, biological and social, found statistics invaluable aids to understanding and dis covery. but it has been the growing belief in the efficacy of figures to prove things, to provide answers to baffling questions, and to reveal the future, that has led to the present widespread use of statistics and statisticians. the child like faith of the public, including businessmen, social reformers, politicians even sometimes the intelligentsia in the validity of numerical data has facilitated the application of statistics to all manner of ends. opportunities for statisticians of various grades and shades have rapidly increased. and the institutions of higher learn ing, impressed by the demand for statistical methodology, have en larged their facilities to meet this demand. it is by no means clear just how much the formal teaching of statistics has been responsible for the present generation of statisticians. there still are many statistical practitioners who have had little or no formal instruction in the art, but who have acquired such proficiency as they possess through self education, through the doing of statistical tasks, and through the direction, advice, and guidance of those who were more expert and experienced than they. that kind of training can be most effective; but it requires a special learning aptitude on the one side and a special teaching aptitude on the other. such aptitudes are also neces sary for real success in the more formal, or academic, teaching, and are not universal among those who take or those who give courses in statistics. careful vocational guidance might prevent the adoption of statistical work as a career by some students who are neither tempera mentally nor intellectually fitted for it. not all persons can become good statisticians, no matter how many academic courses they complete, any more than all graduates of medical schools will become good physi cians. how far vocational guidance should be applied in the making of teachers of statistics is another question, but it may well deserve the attention of those responsible for academic appointments. of course not all teaching of statistics is aimed at making statisti cians. this may make the teaching of the elementary courses more dif ficult and at times less interesting both to teachers and to students. but if such courses were regarded as an essential part of education, and were designed primarily to lead men and women generally to be less statistically illiterate in their reading (even of newspapers) and in their conversation, then their teaching might well become of more absorbing interest to teachers and their study seem more vital to students. more practicing statisticians would not necessarily be bred in this way, but it might well be hoped that a greater degree of statistical sophistication would eventually prevail among college graduates at least. it may seem a far cry from figures to fishing, but i have a notion that both teaching and learning might be helped if every instructor and every student should be a sympathetic reader and re reader of izaak walton’s little book the compleat angler, for the emphasis therein is similar to that which ought to be put upon the learning of statistics. “i tell you, scholar,” says the fisherman instructor, “fishing is an art or, at least, it is an ar t to catch fish.” and in another place he says, “come, i will give you more directions concerning fishing, for i would fain make you an artist.” to which his scholar answers, “yes, good master, i pray let it be so.” there is much expert and enthusiastic description, having, it seems to me, a parallel in statistics, of the dif ferent kinds of flies, and how to make them, and of the various other baits, and for what fish and under what conditions they are appropriate; together with wise counsel to the effect that to become an artist one must acquire skill by observation and much practice. statistical and others journals are perhaps a contributing cause of certain types or variants of statisticians. for they greatly tempt one at times to rush into print prematurely and in so doing to exhibit what one believes is his grasp of statistical technique. to the true scientist technique is only incidental to the attainment of the truth; necessary, perhaps, but not the end and aim of his research. much of the discus sion of technical procedures is, of course, valuable to other statisticians; but it might be well if the publication of statistical articles was made a more soul searching matter, not to be entered upon lightly or without a good deal of critical examination and analysis by and of the author himself. i would insist, were it possible, that every statistician who was in any danger of writing for publication keep upon his desk where he must read them every day these words from a recent textbook on statistical methods: “the publication of results. the first time you successfully complete a test of significance, using your own experimental data, you will feel an urgent need to report the whole process in your thesis or a journal article. a good way to get relief is to write it out in full, then file it away in your note book. if you have described your experiment care fully, it is likely that the only statistical report you need make is some thing like this: ‘the 20 rats receiving treatment a gained an average of 8.3 grams more than those receiving treatment b. the standard error being 1.2 grams, the difference is highly significant’.”’ the expanding r81e of government has of course had much to do with the creation of our present generation of statisticians. more than 800 of t,he members of the statistical association, or something like a third of the total, are working in local, state or federal govern ment agencies. more and more statistics are being made the basis of legislation and of governmental administrative policy. we have in this country not only a public avid for figures but also a statistically minded federal government, with a statistically minded congress made up of men who are not statisticians. that in itself would emphasize the need of guarding truth in statistics and truth in statisticians even the truth that is embodied in the confession “i don’t know.” but these are un usually important times. many decisions are being made and many more will have to be made by those in government, and by those in business as well, which will have a vital influence upon the world in which we shall be obliged to live. it is imperative that those decisions be based upon information and inferences drawn therefrom which are as accurate and complete as possible. statisticians, then, are confronted by unusual opportunities and must face obligations which cannot be viewed lightly. it will be so difficult for statisticians not to do harm by sins of omission as well as by sins of commission that the duty of maintaining high standards in their work will rest heavily upon them. this is not going to be an easy or at all times a popular rde. for it will require not only harder and more exact thinking than many of them may have been accustomed to, but also a highly critical attitude toward the work and statements of others, including fellow statisticians. so many misuses are made of statistics, both innocently and with malice aforethought, and so many more will be made under the stress of crisis or emergency, that it will be highly important for statisticians to undertake the job of being a sort of home guard to kill off statistical fools and liars. this, however, must be the job of statisticians indi vidually, rather than the office of some inquisitorial hierarchy. it is not by official censorship, even though it were to be created by so high minded a body as the statistical association, but by the tender conscience and motherwit of individuals that truth may be made to prevail. statisticians themselves will be exposed to dangers difficult to over come. there will be the danger of too much hurry to know too many things; the danger of having to deal with too great a mass of data whose nature and quality are too little known; the danger of too great in sistence on positive, unreserved conclusions; the danger of too naive a belief by themselves and others in the ability of statisticians to prophesy; the danger of too great confidence in purely mathematical processes; the danger of coming to think of the data only in terms of numbers, and thus of living in a world of unreality which makes mathe matical results seem more valid or significant than they sometimes are. too much the practice of statistics has come to be looked upon as a business rather than as a scientific pursuit. this is not to be laid at the door of teachers of statistics, but rather to the users of statistics; and perhaps to a general and pervading malady afflicting many of our in stitutions of higher learning which caused dean woodbridge of colum bia to say that education “has produced enough excited individuals” but is “producing too few dispassionate scholars.” now if dispassion ate scholarship is anywhere to be desired, it is in statistics, where the possibilities for evil are perhaps even greater than the possibilities for good. this leads to yet another aspect from which i wish briefly to view the statistician his spiritual side. there is something more to being a statistician of the “pure culture,” to speak biologically, than having acquired a familiarity with statistical concepts and terminology, a ready knowledge of the uses and dangers of averages, correlation, standard deviation, sampling, degrees of freedom, chi square tests, and all the other ideas and devices that constitute the tools of the statistical workshop; and even something more than having become expert in the uses of these tools. one may have all this knowledge and expertness and still lack something that is essential to what i have called the “pure culture.” stressing the “truthfulness” of the ancient greeks, r. w. living stone, president of corpus christi college, oxford, says “they had the desire and the power to see the world as it is the disinterested passion for contemplating things avoiding the didactic, they will not distort truth to suit personal bias; avoiding rhetoric, they will not sacrifice it to fine phrases; avoiding sentiment and fancy, they will not gratify their own or their hearer’s feelings at the expense of truth; avoid ing mysticism, they will not move away from facts into a world of emo tions it is the habit of looking straight and steadily at things, and describing them as they are, the very contrary of the habit of didactic comment and of rhetorical or emotional inflation.” now it is just this ‘(spontaneous and effortless veracity” which the greeks teach us that must be a part of every true statistician. “nothing great in science,” declared huxley, ((has ever been done by men, whatever their powers, in whom the divine afflatus of the truth seeker was wanting.” something of that ((divine afflatus,” i take it, inspired the founders of the statistical association in their establishment of our society. to the rekindling of their spirit of devoted truth seeking these times of crisis call us.

Riefler","1940-1969","in 1917 the statistician invaded washington. he came to man the war i agencies, to build up a service of economic reconnaissance for the more effective mobilization of our resources. he found there little data with which to work and few colleagues with whom to consult. those colleagues that he found were centered largely in the census bureau. though small in number, they were an able group, pioneers in the long endeavor to construct a more exact description of the society in which we live. frequently the volunteer who came to washington in 1917 did not know that he was a statistician and did not become aware of that fact for some time afterward. he was, usually, an economist who had had little opportunity to familiarize himself with factual data in quantitative form. he had, however, a great faith in facts and soon acquired an enthusiasm for the questionnaire. when he departed, he had been exposed to a new range of problems and to a factual technique for dealing with those problems. he left behind him a mass of unassimilated data for other statisticians to digest. during the past eighteen months, a second army of statisticians has invaded washington. they, too, have come to man the emergency agencies, to provide the fact finding that is the basis for industrial mobilization in a modern war. they did not come to a statistical wilderness, however, nor have they lacked colleagues in number to welcome them. they arrived at a humming center of statistical work, rich in data, and widely staffed by specialized experts. those who arrived, moreover, have differed from the earlier invaders. they have not been “rookies,” but skilled workers already versed in statistical techniques. the contrast in these two situations, separated by less than a generation, portrays a development of profound significance to statisticians, particularly economic statisticians. in the interval between the two wars, statistics have “come of age” and the statistician, as a species, has multiplied. the pattern of this phenomenon has not been peculiar to this country. the same development can be traced, subject to local variations, over wide areas of the globe. in a very real sense, nevertheless, it has been an phenomenon. in the area of economic statistics, faith in the statistical approach, energy in the compilation of new data, and reliance on statistical findings were early in making their appearance in this country. throughout the past twenty four years, this faith, energy and reliance have tended progressively to spread out side of our borders. they have been contagious and have quickened the adoption of comparable procedures abroad. one may say that they have constituted a cultural export. just as faith in the new industrial techniques, and knowledge of the machine on which they were based, constituted a leading cultural export of great britain during the nineteenth century, we have exported an enthusiasm for the statistical approach in the twentieth. as a cultural export, this development may be ranked with our earlier missionary activities in africa and the far east, and with the picture of life spread throughout the world by the movies during more recent years>. government as a factor in the expansion of statistical activity it is no accident that the statistician first came to washington in numbers in 1917, for it was then that government in this country first embarked on its course of intimate contact with, and direct intervention in, our economic life, a course which has been pursued continuously during the interval. fundamentally, the concurrent expansion of activity in the field of economic statistics has reflected this development. throughout the period government has been the great manufacturer of statistics. this does not imply that statistical activity has been confined to the public services nor that the statistician had no contribution to make to our understanding of economic developments prior to 1917. his contribution might have been great during those earlier years had he had the opportunity. however, in that era of economic liberalism of free economic activity with as little interference as possible by the state his contributions were necessarily limited be cause there was no single organization sufficiently powerful, or in pos session of sufficient funds, to finance the acquisition and compilation of data on which statistical work depends. all this was changed in 1917. the first world war was the occasion for the acceptance on the part of the government of widespread responsibility for participation in the conduct of our internal economic affairs. this participation changed its form, but did not end, at the close of the war. it has continued, in fact, and grown during the intervening years. it has had mixed origins, reflecting, on t,,e one hand, the voluntary initiation of measures directed toward the improvement of social conditions, and, on the other, a response to new problems imposed by the growing tension of the times. in the post war period the government was forced to assume a degree of responsibility for economic readjustment and reconstruction. after the great collapse, it was government that was called upon to create some sort of economic order out of the chaos of 1932. in the succeeding era of world wide economic disintegration and increasingly aggressive economic nationalism, agencies of economic intervention have tended to multiply, at first in support of exposed elements in the economy, and more recently to mobilize the economy for total war. taking the twenty four years as a whole, this great growth in govern mental functions bulks larger than any other single factor in the expansion of statistical activities. the statistician has found in government both sources of new data and an audience intensely interested in such findings as he was able to make. government has certainly not been the sole source of new statistical data during this period, nor has it enjoyed any monopoly in the application of statistical analyses to the elucidation and understanding of current problems. in a very important degree, in fact, pioneering in the development of economic, financial and social statistics, in statistical techniques, and in their application has continued to originate in non public agencies. witness, for example, the recent innovation of the so called public opinion polls. it remains true nevertheless, that in almost all phases of their activities, statisticians have been heavily dependent on government support. public funds have financed in great part the collection of statistical data; public bodies predominantly have fostered the development of new statistical series, and public agencies have relied more heavily than others on the use of statistical guides for the development of administrative policies. there are several reasons why this should be so. the cost of collect ing mass statistics is frequently prohibitive. it is only a public agency supported by public funds that is in a position to decide to collect such basic data as are found, for example, in the census bureau. further more, much of the statistical data on which we have come to rely, originated not as a result of a conscious decision to undertake their compilation, but rather as a necessary by product of public administration. our import and export statistics are a case in point, constituting essentially a by product of customs administration. thirdly, the activities of public administrative agencies are usually comprehensive in scope and their records are usually open to public inspection. in consequence, statisticians have found in these records rich sources of statistical data. public agencies, finally, have tended to place administrative reliance on statistical findings in the development of public policies because the field of their responsibility is broad. they have found that they could not afford to rely on opinion or impression when more objective bases for decision were available. this has meant, in the turmoil of the last quarter century during which government has tended to intervene ever more actively in economic life, a rapid stimulus to the availability, compilation and use of statistical data, especially data of economic significance. although the trend toward public participation in economic life appeared later in this country than in most of the other major countries, and rarely in so extreme a form, it had as a by product, almost from the first, a parallel development of statistical activity. because of our huge size and of the diversity of our internal conditions, there was earlier appreciation here of the need on the part of public authorities for objective factual data to describe conditions covering the country as a whole. they could not afford to place the same degree of reliance on experience, intuition, and impression as the authorities of smaller or more homogeneous states. because of our more decentralized form of government, with powers and activities widely distributed between the federal government and the states, public records have always tended to be more voluminous here than abroad. our statisticians enjoyed, in consequence, earlier access to a wide variety of existing data capable of throwing at least some light on new problems as they emerged. underlying both of these developments has been the temperament, i.e., the willingness of the to furnish information. in this country we have not experienced the same resistance to the gathering of statistical data, particularly data voluntarily supplied, as in many countries abroad. given these favorable conditions and the opportunity to demonstrate his technique on a large scale, the statistician “came through.” he was a success. with scattered data, often fragmentary, at his disposal, he was able to block out the order of magnitude of important elements in our economy about which we had hitherto been ignorant. with more adequate data he was able, frequently, to furnish fairly precise guides to decision. in a world characterized by increasing uncertainty, he was able constantly to whittle away at the area of the unknown. these activities varied widely both with respect to the agencies by which they were sponsored and the diverse sources of data which were subjected to exploitation. they fall, nevertheless, into a general chronological pattern, that reflects in its shifts of emphasis the changing focus of government with respect to economic problems. taking the period as a whole, there were three such major shifts in 1920, in 1933, and in 1940 each corresponding to concurrent changes in the orientation of public policy. in large part these changes were initiated by the statistician, and thus represented a flexible response on his part to changing social needs. to a certain extent they were involuntary, however, forced by conditions over which he had little control. the statistician is a technician. h e must have data, the collection and compilation of which are costly. under these circumstances his major fields of operation are bound to reflect to a considerable extent areas of interest for which support of his activities can be obtained. it is not surprising that, beginning in 1920, efforts were concentrated on the collection of banking data and on general economic data suitable for the construction of economic time series, nor that the research divisions of our monetary agencies were prominent in this role. this was the period in which we still conceived of our economy domestic as well as international as an integrated whole, maintained in equilibrium through a flexible system of prices. we thought of the business cycle as the great menace to the health of that whole. our social thinking, consequently, was oriented toward the development of public policies, chiefly monetary policies, adapted to mitigate or eliminate the business cycle. it was assumed that these policies would operate over the whole economy and that, so long as that economy was maintained in stable equilibrium, its constituent parts would be secure. for the formulation of public policies directed toward these purposes, banking data were essential, together with economic time series, and the general purpose index numbers, based frequently on fragmentary but symptomatic data, which were constructed in this period, were in accord with this diagnosis. though limited in coverage and subject to wide margins of error, they were useful in the interpretation of general trends in the economy, particularly those that were cyclical in character. the principal exception to this generalization is to be found in the fields of agricultural statistics and coal mining statistics. all during the 1920’s it was apparent that there was a malaise in agriculture and coal that was more than cyclical. in these two fields, consequently, statisticians pushed their work far beyond the construction of index num bers. they developed, in addition, data on a comprehensive basis capable of aggregation into relevant categories adapted for the detailed study of these specific segments of our economy. beginning in 1933 this latter type of statistical activity tended to generalize. in the long descent from the collapse of 1929 to the depths of 1932, attention shifted from preoccupation with the state of the economy as a whole to concern over certain of its constituent parts. public policy was directed more actively toward specific support for those parts on the assumption that such rehabilitation was a necessary prerequisite to the restoration of health to the whole. statistically this shift in emphasis was reflected in such activities, to enumerate only a few, as the development of relief statistics, statistics of employment and unemployment by industrial categories, urban mortgage statistics, the segregation of industrial statistics of all kinds into durable and non durable categories, and in a widespread attempt to describe statistically the forces that play on the construction industry. a third shift of emphasis has characterized the past eighteen months, adapted to the mobilization of our resources for war. for this purpose, highly individualized data, frequently plant by plant, are needed, in addition to time series and to statistics descriptive of the economy by major economic segments. the bureau of labor statistics index number of wholesale prices, for example, despite all its recent refinement, does not furnish sufficient data for the establishment of price ceilings. nor are our industrial data, in all their elaboration, adequate for the purposes of the opm. while government has played a major role during the past generation both in providing support for and promoting the use of statistical data, particularly economic data, statistical activity has in no sense been restricted to public bodies, nor has it been confined to the area of economic phenomena. the period has been characterized by intense activity throughout the various fields where the use of statistics as a tool of analysis is capable of making a contribution. within the field of economic data, much of the pioneering work, as, for example, in the field of income statistics, was initiated outside the government. public agencies have not, in general, been prominent in the development and refinement of statistical methodology, nor in the elaboration of techniques of statistical analysis. they have made contributions in this area, but in general they have borrowed their methods and adapted their techniques from academic sources. private business and finance also have participated in the general development of statistical activities, both in the interpretation of existing series and in the compilation of new data, as, for example, in the case of statistics gathered by trade associations. financial institutions offered a major outlet for statisticians during the twenties. market research has provided comparable opportunities in more recent years. public support, however, has remained at the core of the movement. each new activity has increased the demand for statisticians in the public service. each new adoption of statistical techniques outside of the government has led to augmented demands on public agencies, such as the census bureau, for additional information. these demands have reacted in turn on universities which have been called upon to develop more refined methods of analysis and to augment their teaching programs in order to supply an adequate number of skilled technicians. in a sense, therefore, the army of statisticians that came to join that small band of pioneers already functioning in washington, was never truly evacuated. the current heavy influx to man the defense agencies constitutes merely the latest phase of a phenomenon that has continued with few interludes throughout the intervening generation. statistical contributions to economics in view of the enormous resources thus placed at the disposal of the economic statistician during and since the first world war, it may properly be asked: what has the statistician done with these opportunities, for economics, for the social sciences? what progress has been made in the endeavor to describe quantitatively the economic environ ment in which we function? to what extent have we been successful in establishing more precise quantitative relationships between function ally related elements of this environment? what has been done with these findings? to what extent have they improved our wisdom as well as our knowledge? is control of the business cycle more nearly within our grasp? so far as success in describing the economy in which we function is concerned, the answer is, i think, decisive. the statistician has seized the opportunity to advance immeasurably our knowledge of the structure of our economy. so great is the extent of this advance, in fact, that no one person, no matter how expert, is any longer in a position to appraise it. the economist of 1917 could, if he chose to specialize, be reasonably conversant with the sources of all of the major statistics that were available to describe our economy. he could also retain in his memory a great bulk of the more significant of those facts. today, it is doubtful whether the entire staff of any one of our most highly organized and competently equipped agencies for statistical research is in a comparable position. in spite of all the work that has been done to digest and to assemble into major categories the wealth of statistical materials now available and to reduce their movements to index numbers, the research agency of today must specialize in one or more fields of data. it relies upon intimate contact with specialists in other agencies to make good its deficiencies. in a very important degree, many of the statistical aids which we now accept as common knowledge, were completely lacking only a short time ago. take, for example, statistics of national income. the monthly figures, on which so much current reasoning is based, are a product only of the last few years. even continuous annual estimates did not become available until the twenties. except for imports and exports of gold, we knew nothing of the current movement of inter national financial transactions until very recently, while the whole development of systematic data with respect to the balance of payments goes back also only to the early twenties. before then, statistics of physical imports and exports comprised the bulk of our knowledge in that field. the statistician in 1917 did have a wholesale price index to follow, but an index much less revealing than that which we now scrutinize to measure the progress of war inflation. it is difficult to comprehend today, but nevertheless true, that we had no index of physical production whatever until the early 1920’s. there were also little or no data on retail trade, on employment, or on wages. it is amusing, today, to reread the most carefully compiled economic summaries of that earlier period from the point of view of the adequacy of the data that were used and their relevance to the inferences which they were cited to support. bank clearings were considered a most important index of business activity, while railroad car loadings were studied for information on the state of retail trade. in addition to these advances in sheer description of our economic environment, considerable progress has also been achieved in the establishment of functional relationships between diverse elements in the economy. the recent work in the important field of consumption statistics, for example, has provided a working basis for estimating the consumption habits of different classes in the community by income groups. we know in considerable detail the relative importance of different production groups. we now have records painstakingly traced back, breaking down our total economic effort into service production and commodity production, with further breakdowns of commodity production into nondurable consumers’ goods, durable consumers’ goods and producers’ goods. we are able to assess the importance of maintenance activities in our economy, to measure the total of gross capital formation, and to establish the fact that a very large component in that total consists of replacement of existing facilities. the relationships established by these basic statistical contributions have been highly suggestive. they have certainly laid the ground work for the new theories of employment, consumption, savings, and investment with which the economist is now working. there can be no question that they have added very greatly to our knowledge of the functioning of our economy and of the mechanism of the business cycle. opinion is less unanimous as to whether they have increased our wisdom with respect to its control. offsetting factors there is a different kind of question which may also be asked with respect to the influence exerted on the social sciences by the statistician and by the statistical approach. what has the statistician done to the social sciences? has he contributed directly or indirectly, advertently or inadvertently to the social, economic and political disintegration that has culminated in this second world war? the statistician, almost by definition, because of the material with which he works, cannot help but emphasize the immediate, the concrete, the specific, the tangible. has he, by this very fact, in this period in which he has been successful, tended to direct attention from considerations and developments that have been long run and intangible? have the quantitative relations which he has demonstrated between different elements in the economy been so compelling in their power to attract attention that they have been over emphasized as compared with other relationships, just as true and valid, but non demonstrable statistically? in other words, has he made the economist more akin to an engineer and less responsible as a social philosopher? the statistician must work with data, most of which have been national in their coverage. predominantly he has developed these data in a form that would be useful to public agencies, the specific responsibilities of which were national. has he, by this very fact, over emphasized the national economy at the expense of the international organic whole of which it is but a part? just how relevant are the concepts of national income, national production, in a world dedicated to non totalitarian ideals? have they not, in the absence of comparable world data of which they are essentially but a segment, tended to be over emphasized, to become the central focus of analysis? has the reiterated use of these statistical measures done something to the concepts behind them? has it tended to make our economic thinking stop at the political border? in short, have we exported a flavor of our isolationism along with our enthusiasm for statistics? there is, of course, no ultimate answer, pro or con, to probing questions such as these. we can only note them and resolve to overcome the faults implied in them as opportunity permits. with respect to one of them at least, however, we must plead guilty. there is no ques tion but that we have over concentrated on national data, that we tended to become complacent once our internal national economy had been described. when one considers, on the one hand, the enormous efforts that have been devoted to the development of economic data during the past generation, and, on the other, the basic inter relation ships that knit the world’s economy into a whole, it is difficult to explain the paucity of our statistical knowledge with respect to that whole. it can be accounted for in part, probably, by the fact that world data covering activities under the jurisdiction of many different political sovereignties are subject to wide gaps, and even when available, are frequently non comparable in form. in our internal compilations, however, when we faced the same difficulties, we have frequently devised means to surmount them. chiefly it is to be explained by the factor suggested above, namely, that so many of our research agencies have restricted their work to the development of series that would be useful to the public bodies for which they have worked, whose responsibilities were largely national. it is significant to note in this respect that we are indebted to the economic and financial section of the league of nations, a research agency responsible to an international body, for an important segment of such economic data as we do have on a world basis. future lines of development adequate provision to make good this major gap in our information is one of the most important tasks facing the economic statistician today. valuable as it is, the ground work already developed under the league and other international bodies barely scratches the surface of the problem. the world indexes now available, such as those on production, on international trade, and on stocks of primary materials, need to be broadened. we need economic time series comparable to those we have at home because the business cycle is not an internal phenomenon nor are its ravages confined to any one country. we need industry surveys on a world basis because the malaise which has stricken our basic industries coal, textiles, cotton, wheat, coffee, and sugar has in most cases a non national origin. we need geographic area studies by industrial regions on a trans national basis because these studies are essential to the rebuilding of our shattered world by the opening of markets and the provision of investment funds. effort devoted to tasks such as these will pay well in dividends. it has been my privilege recently to go over some preliminary analyses of international trade statistics, integrated by regional geographic areas. i have rarely encountered a situation where a simple analysis, achieved mainly by the regrouping of familiar data, did more to undermine preconceptions in understanding and to clarify intellectual areas that had hitherto been obscure. the preliminary attack on this wide new field of statistical research is already under way. under the impact of war, various agencies of the government have found the area of their responsibilities broadened to include activities outside our borders. they are being called upon to make decisions with respect to these activities and find themselves in need of non national statistical data as a basis for those decisions. mobilization of our industries for war has revealed deficiencies in our internal supplies that must be supplemented from outside. economic warfare calls for intimate knowledge of critical elements in the economy of the enemy. support of friendly powers requires information on which to base decisions with respect to priorities, to sustaining purchases, and to loans. for all of these purposes economic data are required, economic data that consist of more than a summary, nation by nation, of purely national statistics. for many purposes these data must be developed on an integrated basis, international or trans national in character. these activities may go far before the war is over. it may be that in this war a basis will be laid for international statistical research comparable to the basis laid for national statistical re search in 1917. the trend, so established, will probably not be limited to the war period. if any forecast of the future is possible in this period of obscurity, it is that we have passed the crest of the era of national economic isolation. the post war world, whatever its specific character, will be forced to recognize the problem of international economic inter dependence, and to deal with it. that problem, furthermore, will be dealt with by public bodies in some form, such as international agencies, or joint commissions. we will have, therefore, all of the conditions requisite for the inauguration of successful research, the existence of a problem requiring the quantitative clarification which the statistician is able to provide, the presence of a fair body of data on which to work, the support of public agencies in possession of sufficient resources to prosecute effective inquiry and, finally, a pressing need on the part of those agencies for objective economic data on which to base their deci sions. in the development of those data, essential for the preparation of plans and the formulation of policy, the statistician of the future, it is safe to predict, will have a unique opportunity to dedicate his energy to the reconstruction of an integrated world.

Lotka","1940-1969","as you know, the exigencies of the war caused us to abandon our plans for the regular annual convention in cleveland. it had been my expectation to address you informally at a luncheon meeting, in that genial mood which comes as a sort of blessing after the meal when the critical faculties are just a little dulled; when minor blemishes pass unobserved and major defects are more easily forgiven. but now i must transcribe my message. the lighter cargo of the spoken word must be brought to you in the heavier vehicle of the printed page. nevertheless, light cargo it shall remain, for i have it on good authority that people can be fatigued without knowing it, but they cannot be bored without knowing it. and i shall try not to bore you. the statistician is in one respect and in only one respect, i fear a fortunate person. the universe is his topic. he can discourse about anything and everything. i recall a drawing in an old magazine, since discontinued. it pictured a class of undergraduates sitting for an examination. the professor was writing the questions on the black board. the first question was: “what is, and why is it?” i think this must have been a class in statistics. it is not my purpose to attempt here a complete answer to the professor’s question. i have in mind to cover only one half of the universe, a certain special half. classification is an art that allows considerable freedom to those who practice it. taking advantage of this freedom i shall for the present occasion divide all statistics into statistics of material, and statistics of non material things; the latter, as we shall all agree, being by no means immaterial things. it is about these non material statistics that i ask you to think with me for a little while. in response to a request from the office of defense transportation to avoid adding to the travel congestion during the holiday season the meetings were cancelled. this makes the first gap in an other wise unbroken series of 103 annual meetings of the association. although the non material universe is ever present with us, or per haps because of this very fact, we are inclined at times to ignore or even to question its presence. it is true that much of it is trivial. i refer to the universe of thought. every one of the millions of normal adult human inhabitants of this globe, day in and day out, throughout his waking hours, spins a thread of thought. the thought just now in mrs. jones’ mind may be nothing more important than the question where mrs. smith bought her hat; while mr. smith may be thinking of the $10 he won last night at cards from mr. jones. statistics, even of such trivial thoughts, may not be wholly without value. psychologists and psychiatrists may have an interest in them. but not all thought is trivial. there is much thought about the intensely practical affairs of life. and there is an aristocracy of thought. even this is not immune from attack by the statistician. anyone may, if he so chooses, conduct a statistical inquiry into his own thoughts, dealing directly with the non material data themselves. but if the inquiry is to be made more objective, to cover thoughts of many individuals, some form of materialization of these thoughts must intervene; the statistics then are no longer quite strictly statistics of non material things, but actually statistics of the material symbols that stand for these things. such symbols may be spoken or written words or sentences, or they may be corresponding musical performance or notation. they may be spontaneous expressions, or they may be solicited answers to questionnaires or polls. as to these latter, it is interesting to note that here we meet with a phenomenon long familiar in this field, but only lately recognized in the domain of physical observations also, namely that the very act of interrogating alters the state of the object addressed, so that strictly speaking we can never by questioning be really sure of discovering the exact and true answer to the question posed. we note with regret that illustrations of this fact are easily gathered in any court of justice. the statistical analysis of expressed thought has a certain interest and utility from various angles. the practical man, who is primarily concerned with making life possible and economically profitable, has had occasion to play with statistics of both the spoken and written language. the printer, unless he casts his type as he goes, wants to know in what proportion to stock the various letters of the alphabet. for quite different reasons the cryptanalyst, in solving intercepted cipher messages, is interested in the frequency of these letters in different languages. the telephone engineer has explored’ the frequency of the principal words in colloquial english, since he is vitally interested in securing the best possible transmission, and this obviously requires a knowledge of the composition of spoken sounds. while his investigations were made primarily for purposes of practical phonetics, in its application to telephone transmission, incidentally some of the by products throw interesting sidelights in other directions. our language is a population of words in which there is a sort of social stratification of function. nouns, names of concrete things or abstract concepts, were found to be by far the most varied, nearly one half of the different words used to be exact, 1,029 out of 2,240, in 500 tele phone conversations. the number of different verbs were less than half this, namely 456. this, of course, is not accident, but has a meaning. the variety of things appearing in the universe of conversation analyzed was greater than the variety of happenings in which these things were involved. this is not surprising, for a typical statement or clause contains, associated with its verbal predicate, a subject, an object (if the verb is transitive), and in many cases further nouns qualifying the subject or object or the verb itself by an adverbial phrase. however, in these telephone conversations, the total occurrences of verbs (including repetitions, but exclusive of auxiliary verbs), namely 12,550, actually exceeded slightly the total occurrences of nouns, 11,660. while the same verb was repeated on an average eleven times in the total of nearly 80,000 words, the same noun was repeated on an average less than three times. the relatively low proportion of total nouns is probably peculiar to telephone conversations, which on the other hand, are for obvious reasons very rich in pronouns, the words “i” and “you” heading the list of all words.2 all this suggests that certain old fashioned school exercises in gram mar can be developed into something more interesting and of greater significance, in the form of quantitative parsing. this sort of study practically amounts to a statistical appraisal of the furniture of the mind, insofar as this is reflected in language. true, not all words necessarily reflect useful mental furniture. so it has been remarked that the ether of the physicist of the 19th century may have been nothing more than the subject for the verb to undulate. the words mind, soul, may be just grammatical conveniences, subjects for such verbs as to think, to feel, etc. such words, if not very useful, may nevertheless be relatively harmless. but they may also cause con fusion, or worse, a sort of pseudo scientific ponderosity. there is such a thing as “attempting to conceal truism behind pretentious terminology. singularly enough, the trap of verbiage, from which writers aspiring to profundity have not always escaped, has been quite clearly perceived by the comedian and the wit. so moligre in his le malade imaginaire, has the candidate for a doctor’s degree in medicine interrogated to which he gives the illuminating reply ”quare opium facit dormire?” “quia est in eo virtus dormitiva.” more iately, and in less classic vein, that versatile author anon has defined the elusive term “life” whose definition great biologists have discreetly sidestepped : there was a young man of cadia who affirmed life is what it is; for he early had learnt, if it were what it weren’t life would not be what it is. the fact is that our language comprises, among others, two great classes of words. the first of these is what might be called berlitz words, which can be defined, as in the berlitz method of teaching for eign languages, by pointing to an object. the second class is what i might call context words, the meaning of which (if any) can be ascertained only by examining the contexts in which they occur. some of these latter words, undoubtedly, are mere counterfeits, or even slugs, which have been smuggled into the circulation of linguistic currency. such, for example, is the word “ghost.” but these words of doubtful legitimacy are after all a minor part of our speech and writing. they represent a chapter in the morbid an atomy of language. exaggerations regarding these and other linguistic failings, to which a certain overpopularization of semantics has led several at h o r s , will be avoided in any well balanced study, for which a standard has been set by helen eaton’s4 scholarly work. in an appendix to her semantic frequency list for english, french, german and * for critiaism of this, see m. schlauch, ‘semantics as social evasion,” science and society, 1942, 4 h. eaton, semantic frequencg list for english, french german and spanish (first six thousand vol. 6, p. 316. see also. by the same author, the gift of tongues, modern age books, 1942. words), chicago university press, 1940. spanish, she brings a statistical tabulation of the 6,000 most common words classified in natural categories, which may be thought of as the basis for an analysis of our conceptual universe. the parallelism between that universe and the universe of language is admittedly incomplete. for one thing, our english language, in particular, is extremely rich in synonyms, two or more words denoting the same or closely similar concepts. a comparative study of this multiplication of terms in different languages would be of interest. we recall, for instance, that the french have no word for home, but must get along with a house or a hearth. the frenchmen can distinguish only by mien, not by specific words, between his sentiment for colette and his appreciation of a good cigar, or even of a piece of chocolate. but the english language, too, has its lacunae. the french vieillard, the german greis, the latin senex, and the greek ykpwv have no counterpart in english; though according to our custom we have appropriated the greek root in naming a branch of science, gerontology, recently come into prominence on account of the aging of our population to which our vital statisticians have been drawing attention. such lacunae in various tongues may be fortuitous. but wealth of synonyms is clearly enough ascribable to definite causes. english, un doubtedly, owes its wealth in this field largely to its polyglot origin. but other factors also enter, irrespective of any particular language. words with painful associations tend to run to synonyms. so in english we avoid reference to death and speak of passing away. we have three words, graveyard, churchyard, cemetery; the german speaks of kirch hof, friedhof, gottesacker. examples could easily be multiplied. for more or less disreputable things slang often supplies a whole string of synonyms. another motive for multiplying synonyms seems to be the desire to achieve and surpass superlatives: big, large, great, huge, im mense, enormous, gigantic, monstrous, jumbo, etc.; and at the other extreme, small, little, petite, pygmy, puny, minute, diminutive, tiny, wee, etc. to the creative writer, the zittirateur, this wealth of synonyms, allow ing as it does fine shadings and distinctions of meaning, is a treasure. but there is also a diametrically opposite attitude. to a certain type of mind the ideal language would be one in which each word or symbol would have one single meaning, and in which for each meaning there would be a single word. on the construction of such a language, free from all ambiguity and redundancy, certain mathematicians have labored, with perhaps somewhat uncertain success. and there is also what might be called the economic philologist, who wishes to undo the mischief of the tower of babel. attempts to substitute highly efficient artificial languages for the inefficient natural tongues which, like topsy, just grew,” do not seem to have met with much success, and in fact have built a little tower of babel of their own.6 ogden’s proposal of basic english, which manages somehow to say most of what is worth saying, by the use of only about 850 words, seems to be a more practical venture. a perhaps minor defect from which it suffers is a strange sort of irreversibility, in that any english speaking person can read, but by no means write it. to do the latter he must first learn what words not to use a singularly backhanded method of learning a language. the foreigner must learn some 800 english words. but the native must “unlearn” many thousands. i have remarked that the practical man, primarily concerned with making life possible and economically profitable, has had occasion to concern himself with statistics of language. but the artist and the scholar also, whose chief contribution is to make life pleasant and interesting, have paid some attention to, and certainly have supplied much material for, the statistics of thought expressed in sound and symbol. the statistician has not hesitated to apply his technique to horace’s odes, to greek statues or to literary style. among the latest contribution in the latter class are two articles in biometrika, the first by g. u. yule, followed soon after by. a more detailed article by c. b. williams.’ the latter compared the frequency distribution of sentence length in bernard shaw, g. k. chesterton and h. g. wells. a good many years ago, i myself started what i might call an inventory of the poet’s mind. from concordances of wordsworth, milton and keats, i noted the frequency of a considerable number of words. for example, the relative number of mentions of father, mother, sister, brother, in wordsworth was in the ratio of 37 to 35 to 10 to 18; in milton the ratio was 60 to 20 to 7 to 13; in keats, 25 to 16 to 28 to 31. i did not continue this investigation when i found that this kind of thing had already been done by others. so, for example, niceforo in his methode statistique, quotes a study of the frequency of mention of various colors in the sonnets of baudelaire, and gives many examples of the application of statistics to literature and art, among others a study of the distribution of sentence length in balzac. a recent contribution is a statistical study of sound patterning in poetry by b. f. skinnerla who has also examined the frequency distribution of response words in association tests. plotting the logarithms of frequencies as ordinates against the logarithms of ranks as abscissae (the most frequent word has rank one, etc.), he found that over the major part of the range the data fell essentially along the straight line. this relation, however, is not restricted to words collected by the process of association. it appears to be the general characteristic of words in actual use. it had been previously observed and discussed by g. k. zipf, who has made interesting suggestions regarding the underlying causes of the phenomenon. it is to be noted that relations of this kind are observed in a great variety of seemingly unrelated phenomena including, among others, the frequency distribution of scientific productivity and the relation between rank and population of the cities of the united states and of certain other countries.l6 the population of words, like any population, grows by new accessions in excess of eliminations. the new accessions, in modern times, have largely been names for new objects created by man’s ingenuity. curiously enough, the same agency has caused the virtual disappearance of words. how many of the younger generation know what is a pair of snuffers? some ingenious person hit on the plan of so braiding the candlewick that it curled as it burned, its tip projecting into the oxidizing zone of the flame, to be there consumed as it goes, instead of having to be trimmed with a special kind of scissors. and so, while snuffers may be found occasionally in an antique shop or a museum, the phrase “pair of snuffers” is today little more than a dictionary entry. words can also be lost simply by being found superfluous. the word “shall” is thus in process of becoming extinct in the anglo language. the ideal dictionary would not merely list words with their meaning, but would give statistical data regarding their relative frequency in spoken and in written language.” successive editions, published at considerable intervals, would give a quantitative record of the history of the language. this would have been of particular interest for the period of rapid transformation of latin into french and the other romance languages. in comparison with this and corresponding transitions in other tongues, modern speech is relatively at a standstill, anchored by the weight of the printing press. studies of thought expressed in speech or writing can remain on the purely descriptive level, or on the lowest rung of statistical technique, classification and enumeration. they may assume a literary aspect, as in the writings of some of our modern or no longer quite modern writers, who have sought to fix on the canvas of literature something of the ill assorted stream of consciousness. but thoughts are not independent events, to speak in the language of the statistician; or, in the language of the physiological psychologist, they are conditioned reflexes. in the evolution of human culture, order has been established at least in some realms of thought. the condition ing by which one thought leads to another has become systematized. fundamental to this scheme is the principle that competent thought must be free from contradictions. at the same time certain realms of thought have acquired the character of an organic whole, with results of the greatest practical importance, but sometimes perhaps with a deceptive appearance of being all inclusive. scrutiny reveals the fact that the reason for the coherence of this type of systems of thought is that they involve a circle which is by no means vicious: contradictions cannot arise in a system which defines a cello as a large violin, and a violin as a small cello to use an illustration cited, if my memory serves, by the late j. w. n. sullivan. if the operations in such a scheme lead to inevitably consistent results, and in that sense to truisms, this does not by any means deprive the scheme of practical utility, as every physicist knows. whether all competent thought can be united in one coherent whole, or in two or more distinct, but each separately coherent parts, remains today an open question. at any rate, it seems that the best minds come nearest to achieving such coherence; in such minds, as has been pointed out by professor c. 5. keyser,12 thoughts seem to approach the structure which the mathematician speaks of as the “group property. )’ as to the laws of thought which bring about this pleasing harmony, for a long time they had been supposed to have absolute precision, and so to be outside the realm of statistics. more recently the sanctity of these supposedly absolute laws has been questioned. systems have been proposed in which the sharp lines of classical logic give way to the blurred margins of probabilities. as yet the merits of these tentatives are a matter of dispute. this is a battlefield in which i find myself a non combatant in no man’s land, where any overt action on my part would expose me to crossfire fore and aft. recorded thought is preponderantly thought of the past. but there is other thought often unexpressed, and for that very reason of particular importance: thought of the future, purposive thought. in this the statistician may well be said to have a special interest. for the ultimate use of all statistics, except the “believe it or not” type, is prediction. now prediction is of two kinds. on the basis of past observations the astronomer predicts eclipses of the sun and the moon, the position of the planets, and so forth. he is a sort of elongated dachshund, whose nose sniffs tomorrow, while his tail wags yesterday. but there is another, totally different kind of prediction. each of us has his own private field of prediction. i can predict events that no one else can predict. i can predict that when i have completed this sentence i shall get up from my chair and walk around the room. no one else could have predicted that. this private field of prediction consists of the events which we purpose, the events which we successfully will. the english language has embedded this fact in its very structure, by appropriating the vocable ( will” as the auxiliary verb to character ize tense. but note the significant fact that this auxiliary has a companion of somewhat different complexion: the word “shall,” which in some contexts implies a conflict of wills, the imposition of one person’s will upon the future actions of another. now, in this particular part of the universe of thought also purposive thought there is much that is trivial, much that is chaotic: purposes and cross purposes, will contending with will to null effect, where harmony might have produced important collective resultants. for here also organization is possible. some kind of order can be brought into the assortment of purposes that motivate human actions. such ordering influences have indeed been exerted over a wide field, ranging from the sublime teaching of great ethical leaders, through the relatively innocuous drivel of radio sales talk, down to the diabolical propaganda of a herd of gangsters, and their indoctrination of plastic youth with calculated deviltry. a certain, perhaps mistaken delicacy, has allowed little play to statistical investigation of the degree of success of ethical teaching. possibly a healthy, although humiliating lesson might be learned from such an investigation. no delicacy stands in the way of investigating the effectiveness of advertising as influencing consumer demand, and studies along that line are today a common 10 statistical association place though one wonders how so much piffling advertising has survived the scrutiny. as for propaganda, though experimental studies have been made under “laboratory conditions,” propaganda in the wild state of nature, and in its most pernicious form, is inherently difficult of access to statistical examination, for, to quote c. h. hoffer,l3 “propaganda is the process of influencing attitudes in a veiled manner, regarding matters of controversy within a society. since it is veiled and partisan in nature, propaganda retards the formation of intelligent public opinion, and thus is a menace to democracy.” the very obliquity and secretive character of propaganda tend to withdraw it from examination in the honest light of day. the indoctrination of youth is a somewhat debatable subject, though the horrible examples of naziism and fascism and other (‘isms” certainly give us pause. some may agree with me and some may not, if i say that the function of schools and colleges, aside from cultivating an appreciation of the humanities, is to teach facts and methods, thought processes, and the faculty of forming independent opinions; but that it is none of the functions of such institutions to inculcate ready made opinions. such indoctrination is abhorrent both to the spirit of scientific truth and to all sense of rational and honest citizenship. but what has this to do with statistics? the answer is obvious: the whole mechanism of democratic government is statistical. the election of our governing bodies is a statistical experiment on a national scale. as to its results, the experiment is not always an unqualified success. we have not reached perfection. a variety of unofficial polls which have come into vogue perhaps point a direction in which lies improvement. certainly, as a gauge of popular sentiment of the nation’s thoughts and purposes, these polls are sometimes more representative than the actions of the elected representatives of the people. that such polls are by no means infallible, and indeed are not wholly free from danger of abuse, must be admitted. but abuse does not disqualify competent use. the unofficial inventories of the nation’s mind may contain the germ of important developments. i have remarked that statistics of non material things are by no means immaterial. this may be one of those propositions that need only to be stated to be at once accepted as true. yet i wonder whether it is generally realized how greatly, and on what scale, the non material universe of thought, and especially of purposive thought, has affected the course of material, physical happenings. actually it has been nothing less than a geological agency, a phenomenon of planetary dimensions. this is a topic that, could be expanded at length, but here it must suffice to give one or two illustrations. it has been estimated14 that the amount of carbon dioxide annually thrown into the air by the combustion of coal by man is about the same as the total carbon dioxide produced annually in the respiration of the earth’s total animal population, and is of the order of one three hundredth of the total carbon dioxide in the air. it represents a quantity of carbon which surely must have taken hundreds of thousands of years to accumulate as coal in the earth’s crust. the case of nitrogen is even more remarkable. for many years the increasing agricultural needs of the rapidly growing human population had largely been met by consuming supplies of nitrates accumulated through the ages in the saltpeter beds of chile. as the possible exhaustion of this supply began to come into view, less than 70 years after it had been opened to exploitation (1831), men turned their thoughts on this problem, and human ingenuity unlocked the practically inexhaustible supply of atmospheric nitrogen. by 1935 about 75 percent of the total world’s production of bound nitrogen was obtained from this source.16 but it is not only, and perhaps not primarily, for the purposes of the peaceful conduct of life, that human ingenuity had been applied. certainly a powerful stimulus to the early development of the nitrogen fixation industry was the desire in certain quarters to provide for the needs of war, to acquire a supply of raw materials for explosives, independent of the chilean nitre beds. it is here that the contrast is seen between the highly effective organization of reflective thought, logic, mathematics, theory of probability and their applications, on the one hand, and, on the other, the woefully incompetent organization of purposive thought. the fact is, that the human species as it stands today is sick. it suffers from a complaint which is more easily diagnosed than cured, because it is congenital. i say that the human species is sick. it is sick in the sense that any species afflicted with an assortment of propensities that impedes it in the struggle for survival that perhaps threatens its survival can certainly be said to be sick. if we want a name for this sickness we might call it pernicious orthogenesis. now orthogenesis is one of those big words which we prefer to use sparingly. i have borrowed it from biology, and even there it is not in very good repute. but for my present purpose it is a useful word, though here, addressed to a mixed audience, it may call for a little explanation. some biologists have thought that the evolution of certain species may have proceeded, not by a mere preferred survival of more advantageous departures from the mean, but by an inherent tendency of certain species, quite aside from external influences, to drift in a certain direction. by a sort of inherent biological proclivity, certain species seem to have been predestined to success, or foredoomed to failure. so, for example, the giant saurians of jurassic time perhaps became the victims of their fatal propensity for growing bigger and bigger.16 whether such orthogenesis by physiological processes or anatomical features actually has taken place is a matter of dispute among biologists. in this dispute we need not take part, because the existence of the kind of orthogenesis with which we are here concerned will not be disputed. the fundamental characteristic of orthogenesis is that it proceeds in a set direction, regardless of the utility or the fatality of that direction. for that very reason orthogenesis becomes a powerful factor in evolution, because it can proceed much more rapidly than the gradual accumulation of variations or mutations from generation to generation. indeed, it can proceed at a rate which, on a geological scale, is nothing short of explosive suddenness. this is precisely what has happened to the human species in the past few centuries, after a period of preparation extended over perhaps an equal number of millennia. curiosity, that ingrained trait of human nature, is the mainspring of this type of orthogenesis. in these days it is rather out of fashion to extoll the virtues of pure science, or even to attempt any distinction between pure and applied science. but it remains a fact of superlative importance that men have questioned nature from simple curiosity, and have wormed out many of her secrets, with no conscious intent to make so called useful application of the knowledge gained or indeed without suspecting that it might bring catastrophe crashing down upon the peoples of the earth. these applications, favorable or unfavorable to the species, have come after the scientific discovery and not infrequently a long time after, figuring in the ordinary human time scale. indeed, some of these applications were not possible until considerable progress had been made in the unprejudiced interrogation of nature. this is the typical characteristic of orthogenesis continued movement in a set direction, independently of the utility or harm of the result, until a stage is reached where selection has something tangible to lay y a. j. lotka, physical biology, 1925, pp 296,3781 *some reflections on a non material universe 13 hold on, and to operate either for greater survival, or, it may be, for destruction. this then is the sickness with which the human species is sick: by a process of orthogenesis, that is, through the accumulation of knowledge and skills from generation to generation, man has developed marvelous powers for the individual to achieve his purposes. but he has failed, and failed very badly, to organize these purposes for their survival value. man’s evolution, in this respect, has been lopsided, and there is evidence in the rocks that such lopsided development is a danger signal for the species. in these times of grave historical events, even an informal address from your retiring president cannot fail to be projected against the background of the weighty issues that are occupying the minds of all responsible men and women. the winning of the war is necessarily the task of our military leaders and the forces bravely carrying out their strategies. the winning of the peace is the concern of us all, but more especially of those who will give orientation to purposive thought. it is an unfortunate fact that to guide men into competent purposive courses is far more difficult than to teach them the use of ingenious contrivances for attaining such ends as they may set themselves. we give a man an automobile and show him how to turn a switch, shift a lever, step on the gas, and away he goes. he needs no persuasion that the scheme works the demonstration would convince even that legendary skeptic who, on seeing a giraffe, remarked “there ain’t no such animal ” but in guiding men’s purposes we have no such compelling demonstrations to present as a means of persuasion. added to the difficult problem of devising efficient policies, there is the still more difficult one of overcoming resistance to their adoption. this resistance is twofold. the people must first be persuaded of the need and the reasonable effectiveness of the proposed policies ; second, what is even more difficult, they must be induced to sacrifice certain personal advantages in the pursuit of purposes transcending individual interests. and there is another important and fundamental difference between the influence of organized reflective thought in determining group or collective activity of human society and, on the other hand, the role of organized purposive thought in directing group behavior: it does not require any very high intelligence for the individual of the rank and file to profit by the accomplishments of our technical experts and scientific geniuses. in this connection, a series of photographs reproduced in the newspapers the other day told an instructive fable. it showed a genial chimpanzee going through the orthodox motions of lighting a cigar and proceeding thoroughly to enjoy a good smoke. but it was a little artistic detail that caught my particular attention: this chimp, we are informed, always begins by carefully stripping the brand label from the cigar. he does not, of course, know why he does this except that he has seen it done. i am afraid that many of our actions have not a very much sounder basis. and so long as we are dealing with what i might call the mechanics of everyday life, this very diluted participation in the management of the world works satisfactorily enough. we can leave the thinking to others, and just push buttons, relying on the mysterious mechanism behind them to work according to schedule. but this sort of thing is quite inadequate for the direction of collective human activity by and for organized purposive thought. in a democracy, at any rate, the individual must personally and understandingly participate in the management of affairs. this makes high demands on the general level of intelligence, wisdom, and enlightened patriotism under our form of government. and here let us do our thinking as statisticians, and above all as realists. evil men and groups of such there will presumably always be among the earth’s population. no scheme which fails squarely to face this fact can receive our serious consideration. and the danger probably can never be eliminated that, from time to time, an evil genius may give false and wicked orientation to the purposive thought of multitudes. i say let us do our thinking as statisticians, for the problem with which we have to deal is fundamentally a problem of numbers. there are certain established, and on the whole very effective, methods of dealing with evil men on a civil scale. there are punishments as deterrents, and there are ways of restraining and constraining the unruly, if need be with capital finality. but fundamental in these meth ods is a numerical situation: the law abiding and law enforcing element, in civil life, in national life, immensely outnumbers the miscreants. unfortunately, when we seek to translate into international procedures the principles and methods of civil law enforcement, we are met at the very start with a complete lack of parallelism. nations, un like individuals, are not counted in millions, not even in hundreds; and those of dominating power, not even in tens. this completely upsets the parallel. when an issue arises between nations, it is not a case of a handful of men against millions, but at best of one nation against a very limited number of others four or five perhaps if the contention is among the world’s great powers. what is more, the extreme contrast of right and wrong in the present contest must not obscure to our sight the fact that ordinarily issues are not thus drawn with indisputable clarity, and if sides are taken, say, by five powers or their representatives, as to the merits in a dispute, the split may not be four to one, but three to two, in favor of one or the other contention. such a split as this will in no wise guarantee a decision without the use of force, or a wise or good decision, with or without the use of force. and if the use of force should be enjoined by some policy previously agreed upon, to settle such a dispute, there is still no guarantee that parties only indirectly interested will carry out their mandate. past experience does not encourage confidence in the reliability of such undertakings. and, most important of all, in addition to these negative failings that may be inherent in a plan devised to maintain peace, it may have the very serious positive defect of giving rise to a false sense of security. here also past experience is not encouraging. where there are brigands it is still the part of a wise traveler to carry arms. does this mean, then, that we are to regard as entirely hopeless all attempts to organize men’s purposes to transcend personal interests, to work for greater and better harmony? if, as statisticians, we have recognized the problem as being, in one respect at least, a problem of numbers, does this mean that the cards are stacked against us in our desire to establish and preserve a peace with honor and decency? no, we shall not consider the case hopeless. between an attitude of infantile optimism, at one extreme, and giving way to senile defeatism at the other, there surely is a middle ground of adult realism, which does not dwell in a world of illusions, but discerns difficulties for what they are. when we labor to win the war, our aim is single and clear; the prob lem is only one of the means to achieve this clear purpose. but to speak of winning the peace is to telescope into one phrase what is really a discouragingly complex problem, even in merely focusing the target at which to aim. the effort to win the war will be brought to a final climax in due time. but the peace can be secured and preserved only by lasting measures pursued unrelentingly through all time. among such measures may i in concluding suggest only one: a world cataclysm has welded together for the time being the united nations. let us work to preserve this unit. the parable of the mote and the beam applies to nations as it does to individuals. let us bury minor criticisms of our allies and friends in garlands of praise for the deathless glory of their magnificent stand against our common foe.

Goldenweiser","1940-1969","﻿research in a policy making body is for the purpose of shaping policy. it is the function of the research staff of such an organization to formulate policy, while the responsibility of the executives of the institution is to adopt or reject it. the executives must choose their research man, must back him while he works with them, and let him go when they can back him no longer. this does not mean that they must always follow his advice: they may modify it, or reject it, without interfering with a satisfactory working relationship, but they must have confidence in his competence and integrity; when they lose that the partnership must be dissolved. this doctrine stated baldly may sound novel. it was not so long ago that a line was drawn between research and policy making: re search was supposed to deal with facts alone, laboriously compiled, noncommittally presented, with interpretation restricted to indicating the technical limitations of the evidence. such an extreme view of the limits of the research function could not be and in practice never was enforced. but even its theoretical acceptance had bad effects. it dis couraged responsible thinking in the research man, who needs all that he can muster, and encouraged the dangerous but time honored habit among executives of making decisions on the basis of practical experi ence, horse sense, or some other euphemism for hunches or smokeroom gossip. practical policy in order to be so&d must be based on technically competent analysis of available facts, leavened by imagination and activated by courage. these are indispensable to the proper weigh ing of responsible decisions. participation in the formulation of vital policies is the lifeblood of constructive thinking. an intellectual eunuch, incapable of experienc ing the agony and thrill of vital decisions, cannot be an effective inter preting economist or statistician. this function requires a redblooded person full of energy and creative endeavor. the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. during the past quarter century the relationship between the research staff and the executive has developed markedly in the right direction. it has made particularly rapid strides during the war when tradition and prerogative have had to give way to accomplishment. there are, however, inherent diffi culties in the relationship. executives, even when they are not political appointees, are likely to be drawn from among men who have had much experience in successfully running their private businesses and little experience in public affairs. they have self confidence based on their success, and the best among them have qualities of decisiveness and leadership. they are likely, however, to lack sufficient appreciation of the importance of basing national policies on broader grounds than in dividual experiences. there is real danger in experience. it often results in narrowing a public man’s approach to national problems to con siderations with which he has become familiar in a particular and often not a representative set of circumstances. he finds it difficult to grasp the fundamental truth that in the national economy the whole is far greater than the sum of all its parts. in the business world there has developed over the years a set of standards which have been tested by experience and found to be effec tive, particularly in highly competitive local enterprises. these stand ards are a part of a philosophy the basic tenet of which is that profit is the test of success. they are less applicable to nation wide organiza tions, whose success depends on sustained national prosperity, and are generally inapplicable in public service, where the test of success is the public welfare. it is difficult for an executive who steps from private into public service promptly to discard habits of thought that have brought success in the past and to substitute for them the entirely different standards appropriate to his new responsibilities. directly and indirectly, sometimes bluntly and sometimes subtly, this conflict of standards is a serious obstacle to effective cooperation between the executive and the staff adviser. sound theory is sound practice. but the difficulties confronting the staff man are not all outside of himself. he is likely not to have had many occasions to make important decisions. in most cases he has not learned by hard experience the difference between logical deduc tions and motivating forces. basically there is no difference between sound theory and good practice. both must take into account all rele vant factors and their mutual relationships. the apparent difference between the two rests on the fact that, while both are apt to overlook important considerations, those overlooked by one are likely to be dif ferent from those overlooked by the other. the theorist, for example, is likely to disregard human factors, while the practical man is prone to underestimate or not to recognize potent but unfamiliar objective influences. it must be the endeavor of the professional interpreter to grasp the force of the human equation, to make proper allowance for subjective friction in the derivation of motivating forces, just as the executive must learn to measure and evaluate the objective forces at work. clarity is not a vice. the staff man must learn to recognize his own limitations and those of his data. for one thing, facts by their very nature record the past, while decisions relate to the future. for another, the professional jargon that inevitably develops in any much explored subject is likely to be unfamiliar to anyone outside of the clan. the masonic grip of the economist should be reserved for use within the lodge and should not be introduced into the council chamber. the neophyte sometimes thinks that abstruse terminology is a necessary part of professional competence. as a matter of fact, more often than not it is merely an affectation, a bad habit, which covers up undigested thought. frequently it is a substitute for clear thinking rather than a means of implementing it. clear understanding, a thought out grasp of a problem, can nearly always find expression in simple, direct, and nontechnical language. confusing the foreigner. perhaps the clearest and most timely exam ple of confusion created by terminology is in the so called saving in vestment analysis. the basic concepts in this analysis are both simple and true. the theory is that income received by a people must be dis bursed again either for consumption or for capital formation. other wise the income withheld will diminish the total income stream and on the next round there will be less income to distribute, and a defla tionary spiral is likely to start. this is in substance a sophisticated ver sion of the element of truth contained in the time honored popular say ing that spending is a social virtue since it puts money into circulation. every student of economics in his freshman year has been taught, and i dare say is still taught in most classrooms, that this doctrine is fal lacious. but then, this is not the only thing taught to the freshman that the graduate student finds it necessary to discard or modify. the popular theory, which in its homely garb has been excluded from the elementary classroom, has been caparisoned in brand new terminology and presented with a flourish to the advanced seminar. there is nothing inherently complex in this theory. the meaning of the terms eaving and investment as used in every day language is clear enough. a person’s savings are that part of his income which he does not spend on consumption, while his investments are the part of his saving which he places in income producing assets. what matters is whether the aggregate of investment by all individuals and corporations, after allowance for liquidation of investments wherever it may occur, is sufficient to absorb the aggregate of all savings after allow ance for deficits that may be incurred by some. if it is not sufficient, there will be a remnant of national hoarding, which will exert a defla tionary drag and force income to a lower level. emphasis on the term national hoarding as the crucial point in the picture would be helpful; it is almost self explanatory and convincing, because hoarding is gen erally recognized as a reprehensible habit, while most people are brought up to believe that thrift is a noble virtue. but the economist as a rule does not present the problem in such simple terms, understandable to the layman and consistent with his usage. the economist uses much more complex definitions and each group of economists, if not each individual one, uses different defini tions. under the spell of these varying uses of terms, some maintain that the volume of savings must equal that of investments, and others that the two will never be the same. while each set of definitions may be logically consistent and as clear as day to its proponent, the debate moves into a rarified atmosphere where the layman dare not penetrate. above all, what makes the doctrine unacceptable to the layman is that it appears to condemn what he knows that he as an individual must practice for self protection, namely, thrift. he cannot be expected to understand easily that, while thrift is a necessary protection against poverty for the individual, an excess of savings by all may result in causing poverty for the economy as a whole. in that case the individual saver may lose far more through unemployment than he was able to save by the exercise of thrift. neither can he be expected to keep in mind that what is meant is not investment at all, as the layman under stands it, but only the total outlay on capital goods. that the heart of the analysis and the threat to economic stability lie in the relation ship between aggregate saving by millions of individuals and aggregate spending for capital goods, called investment, is quite beyond the lay man’s power to comprehend. while with a little more effort on the part of the staff man these thoughts could be presented to officials simply and clearly, all too often they are stated in seemingly familiar terms without warning that the terms are not used in their familiar sense. this results at worst in com plete misunderstanding and at best in unnecessary confusion. forcing words with well established meanings into unaccustomed uses is a good example of what galsworthy calls (referring to the pronunciation of english names) the sound british custom of confusing the foreigner. the richel the poorer. the saving and investment analysis may also serve to illustrate a danger confronted by staff men far greater than mere terminology, namely, the temptation to depend on a simple formula for the cure of too many varied economic ills. the saving investment theorem, stated simply, is a formula which, like the quan tity theory of money, is little more than a truism. in fact, the great service that this formula has rendered is to release the economist from his imprisonment within the walls of the equation of exchange. and yet, there is danger that it has only released him from confinement within one formula to imprison him within the terms of another. the great difficulty with the quantity theory was that it was based on faith in the mechanical operation of monetary forces; its proponents believe that the volume of money controls prices, and that by controlling prices one can regulate the entire economy. emphasis on theincome flow, as contrasted to the volume of money, represents progress to wards a more realistic approach to economic problems, because it takes account of the behavior of humans. but in applying the new doctrine, as the old, the economist should make allowance for the complexity and mobility of economic forces and be on his guard against placing too much faith in causal relationships between terms of a formula. in its simplest terms the theory is that, if a part of the national in come is hoarded, the income flow diminishes and deflation results. but frequently the argument goes further. from past experience and from the analysis of social trends, some conclude that there is a definite rela tionship between the size of the national income and the volume of savings whichis likely to prevail in future years, a relationship according to which the proportion of income saved will rise as income increases. as our productive capacity and our national income increase, there will be an ever increasing volume of savings. also, estimates are made of the avenues of investment which are likely to be available into which these savings can be channelled, and it is found that these outlets do not add up to the required total. thus national hoarding is an enemy constantly lurking behind the scene and preventing the growth of in come which our growing capacity would permit. consequently our actual income will constantly lag behind our maximum capacity. the higher our potential income, the further will we fall short of utilizing our resources fully, and the greater the probable magnitude of unem ployment. the richer we grow the poorer we get in terms of jobs for all. the only way out of this dilemma is then said to be compensatory spending by government. this diagnosis has become an argument for a course of action, an argument fashioned at a time when such a course of action was desirableand, it may be added, was partially pursued but on an entirely different basis. there is agreement that national hoarding is not consistent with the realization of the maximum level of economic activity and that, if it occurs, it must be counteracted. however, statistical evidence now available is not sufficient to be the basis of precise predictions as to the future levels of saving and investment and cannot reflect all social changes which the future may bring. the assumption that savings will be far in excess of investment outlets is a hypothesis and as such it needs to be verified by further research and is subject to modification by accumulated experience. nothing in the history of similar forecasts in the past justifies the acceptance of the assumption as the basis of responsible planning or definitive action. if people save more as income rises, outlets for their savings must be found. while it is true that past evidence suggests that savings habits do not change easily, there is no satisfactory basis for thinking that changed circumstances, particularly a wider distribution of income and wealth and an increased sense of economic security, may not change the ratio of savings to income. nor is there a basis for thinking that new outlets for investment or new means of spending larger amounts through old channels will not be found. the amount of possible invest ment in the future is not dependent entirely upon technical progress. it must be viewed with reference to the entire economic setting in which business operates, including prices, taxes, public controls, em ployer employee relationships, and numerous other factors that must be taken into account before the formula will be transmuted from a dead and barren phrase into live reality. jobs for all and goods for all. a practical approach to the problem would be that, since unemployment must not be tolerated in a modern economy, it must be eradicated as soon as signs of it appear. it must not be permitted to start a vicious cycle. whether this will involve much action by the government will remain the great unknown in the equation. certainly, compensatory fiscal policy will be only one among many approaches which public policy will have to make to wards m'aintaining a high and stable level of economic activity. yet, there can be no doubt that the government must stand ready to pro vide such employment as private industry does not supply, and with this in view, it must have plans developed in advance and ready to be put into operation on short notice. one thing is sure: we do not as yet approach a volume of production sufficient to give everyone a decent minimum standard. therefore, the remedy must be sought not in the contemplation of increased leisure, but in concentration on efforts to increase the output of goods and to improve their distribution. this somewhat lengthy detour was introduced to illustrate the kind of pitfalls an interpreting economist must avoid, but in the course of presentation it developed into a statement of a position. perhaps this is an unconscious demonstration of how easy it is for an interpreter to be diverted from his original purpose. training is a trust. in addition to avoiding abstruse terminology and inadequately tested formulas, there are other tests to which a staff adviser of a policy making body must subject himself. he must be sure to gather together, digest, and have command of all available informa tion bearing on the subject under discussion. he must be fully aware of the limitations of this information, of the margin of error to which it is subject. the touchstone of a theory lies in quantitative data, that is, in statistics. statistics are the economist’s conscience. his reliability stands or falls by their verdict. when he disregards them, or misreads them, or improvises them, or stretches them beyond the limits of their capacity he violates the trust imposed upon him by his training and by his responsibilities. policy must rest on forecasts. the staff man must ponder and com prehend the full import and implications of the problems confronting his principals and of the policies designed to meet these problems. he must be prepared to venture a forecast of future events in case a given policy or its alternative is adopted. contrary to a commonly held opin ion that research must avoid forecasting as a deadly sin, the basic purpose of economic and statistical analysis of social and economic events is to make forecasts. the french saying to know, in order to foresee, in order to control (savoir pour prhvoir, pr6voir pour pouvoir) is a wise one. unwarranted forecasts must be avoided, and there must be full recognition of the fact that a forecast is a hypothesis and not a fact. but courage to make as good a forecast as available facts and past experience warrant is an essential quality of effective research staff work. biases are sirens. in presenting data to his principals the staff man must avoid a great variety of biases which like sirens tempt to lure him from the journey to his goal. some of them may be enumerated: 1. the bias of pessimism or optimism. what he says should not be influenced by fearful apprehension or by wishful thinking. he must endeavor to face and appraise the facts no matter where they may lead. 2. the bias of no bias. this somewhat paradoxical bias is both real and common. an excessive effort at being impartial often results in shrinking away from indicated and necessary conclusions. “yes and no” answers should have no place in a staff man’s vocabulary. 3. the bias of accuracy. accuracy beyond the requirements of the case under discussion may not only delay decisions, confuse the listeners, and burden them with unnecessary qualification, but it may also pre vent the reaching of necessary conclusions within the applicable margin of error. careful abidance within this margin, on the one hand, and willingness to venture to the limits permitted by it, on the other, are the outstanding characteristics of the expert as contrasted with the amateur in economic interpretation. 4. the bias of consistency. just because he has said one thing on a previous occasion the staff man should not hesitate to say the opposite if circumstances have changed or if he has become convinced that he was wrong. many serious mistakes have been made by basing decisions on conditions that no longer prevailed. winning the last rather than the current war is a habit not confined to generals. consistency is not only the bugaboo of small minds but the rock on which essential flexi bility of policy may shatter. vested interest in an opinion previously expressed is as dangerous in a staff man as vested property interests are in a judge or legislator. 5. the bias of cleverness. the russian proverb: udo not sacrifice your father for a wisecrack” is well turned. phrases help to punctuate a presentation and to fasten it in the listeners’ minds. but they carry a danger of sacrificing clear and straight thinking to the desire to use a telling phrase. 6. the bias of tact. it is essential for a staff man to be sensitive to the atmosphere of a meeting, but he must endeavor not to be domi nated by it to the detriment of detachment in his presentation. on the other hand, he should avoid egotism and be willing to give equal weight to a competent judgment, whether it originates with him or with some one else. 7. the bias of logic. not infrequently a conclusion that flows logi cally from its premises may nevertheless be wrong either because the premises have not been adequately examined or because the process of reasoning is too rarified for use in practical affairs. the human equation must be taken into account in all policy recommendations. 8. the bias of originality. better be right in a conventional way than wrong in a highly original way. 9. the bias of expertness. methods and devices are no better than the material and the understanding that go into them. uncritical curve reading is as dangerous to sound conclusions bs is a disregard of the sequence of past events. particularly dangerous are curves that have been corrected, by some device, for the very thing which they are sup posed to exhibit. it is not an unusual experience to see an interpreter, who has adjusted two curves for amplitude and direction of fluctuations and for level, stand back and marvel at their close correlation. 10. the bias of omniscience, the gravest of them all. some principals expect a staff man to know everything, and staff men are likely to dread admitting that there is something they do not know. it is wise, and it is a part of the job, to know as much as possible about all phases of the subject under discussion. it would not do not to know, or not to be in a position quickly to find out, too many of the ascertainable relevant facts. but neither would it do not to be willing to say ui don’t know.” attempts at covering up gaps in his information by more or less hazard ous guesses have rightly undermined many a staff man’s reputation for reliability. importance of being awake. it has been said that an expert is a per son who knows more and more about less and less. the danger that confronts an economic and statistical interpreter is the opposite he must strive against knowing less and less about more and more. the subjects he must cover tend to comprise the universe. it is essential for him to keep informed about a great many things but not to spread himself so thin as not to know enough about anything to be a depend able guide to policy. these are some of the biases and difficulties that a staff man must avoid. there are many others. it is clear that he cannot proceed in the rumored manner of a duke who dreamed that he was making a speech in the house of lords, and when he awoke found to his amazement that he was. he must not be either too self confident or too reticent; he must be tactful but not timid; and, above all, he must never be sub servient. when a staff man begins to shape his opinions in accordance with what he thinks his principals want his usefulness as a public servant is over. i the anvil chorus. in attempting to acquire the necessary virtues and to avoid the threatening vices a research man has to depend, in addi tion to searching self analysis, on contact with his associates and with fellow members of the professi.on inside and outside of his immediate group. in the final analysis man is dominated largely by the subcon scious. since he cannot be psychoanalyzed prior to every presentation he must take care to subject his psyche to exposure to others. out of such contacts alone can emerge a sane appraisal of human problems. and problems of economic policy are human problems whose solution depends on grasping human verities.

1944,"39th","Walker, Helen M.","Female","Teachers College, Columbia University","Academia","104th","December 27–29, 1944","Washington, DC",NA,"The Role of the American Statistical Association",1944-12-27,"Helen M. Walker","1940-1969","three years have passed since the members of the statistical association last came together in a national gathering. the annual meetings of 1942 and 1943 were relinquished chiefly because of the demands upon wartime transportation facilities, relinquished willingly in recognition of the compelling immediacy of the demands of war, but relinquished with full awareness that the association and any influence the association may have would not be strengthened by such action. the justification for holding a national meeting this year, while transportation is still over taxed, resides in an earnest conviction of the board of directors as to the contribution of statistics to the public weal and the responsibility which rests upon the statistical association for furthering that contribution. even the most casual reading of the program for this annual meeting will indicate that it mirrors a concern for the increased efficiency and unity of the entire statistical profession and for its more effective service to the welfare of society. early in 1944 the board of directors decided that every possible effort should be made to hold a national meeting this year, and that it should be so planned as to focus attention upon the relation of statistics to the formation of policy and on the contribution of a professional association of statisticians in promoting that relation. it is a matter of gratification to every member of the statistical association that the vice president of the united states is a man who thinks statistically and who understands the contribution of statistical investigation as basis for rational decision. that we were able to prevail upon him to speak at this dinner is an honor of which all of us are deeply sensible. at a time like the present when almost everyone is trying to foresee the nature of the world which lies ahead and to dedicate his best intelligence to promoting the welfare of that world, it is inevitable that a national gathering of statisticians should face the question of what contribution the statistical association might be expected to make toward the general wellbeing of society. i have not been able to escape this topic, nor do i want you to be able wholly to escape it. an association is strong and useful in proportion to the amount of creative thought which its members devote to its activities. members of the statistical association presumably have this in common: they recognize in the complex problems of our very complex world a statistical aspect of which ·the non statistician is unaware; they believe that it is desperately urgent that for such problems correct and pertinent statistical information be secured and thoroughly studied before decisions are made; they are convinced that much of the important work in the natural and the social sciences, many aspects of government, commerce and industry are incomprehensible to persons unfamiliar with certain fundamental statistical ideas; they believe it is of the profoundest importance to secure a more effective application of statistical logic in the solution of the world's problems. therefore it seems obvious that the conscious purpose of the association must be to facilitate in every way possible the most informed, effective, intelligent application of statistical methods to those problems in government, in jurisprudence, in public administration, in the sciences, in business, commerce, industry, education, finance, for which the evidence that should be taken into account is stochastic in nature. to realize this objective, many kinds of interrelated services must be performed. those persons now holding statistical positions must be given the utmost stimulation to good work which an active professional association can devise. the future must be safeguarded by attracting young people of promise to the profession, giving them the best possible training, and helping them find appropriate positions. both the art and the theory of statistics must be extended and means found to disseminate more widely the results of recent research. ways must be found to make the general nature of statistical thinking better understood by the average intelligent citizen and particularly by persons in responsible positions charged with policy formation. committees of the association will continue to render distinguished service to the government by making available expert and disinterested advice, as has been done for many years, and doubtless such cooperation will be extended to new areas. it is to be hoped that more local chapters of the association will develop service to their state and community governments similar in purpose to the work of those committees of the national body which now work with the federal government. and as instrument to these ends, there must be a strong professional association with an efficient structure and resources of personnel adequate to work effectually toward its recognized purposes. the association needs to move on all these fronts at the same time. in particular, a manysided program of interpretation seems to be called for. certain aspects of interpretation in which the association has been long engaged i shall say little about this evening, not because they are unimportant but because their importance, being generally recognized, needs no underscoring, and it is more expedient to put our attention upon other aspects of interpretation where a new or more determined effort appears to be needed. no one can doubt that there has been a vast proliferation of statistical enterprise during the war. it is well known that the extension of statistical activity has far outstripped the available supply of workers who are competently trained, either in the mathematical theory of statistics or in the arts of statistical procedure; that agencies have been bidding against agencies for even mediocre persons if they can claim a little training in statistics; that the shortage of college teachers of statistics would have been alarming had it not been paralleled by an even greater shortage of students. obvious as the critical shortage of trained statisticians has been to all persons concerned either with the conduct of statistical activity or the teaching of statistics, it has probably not made a profound impression upon the college administrator. unless the statistical association brings this shortage to the attention of persons responsible for college programs and also to the attention of prospective students, we need expect no sudden burgeoning of the statistical curriculum and no spontaneous increase in the number of talented young people seeking statistical careers. some day i hope the statistical association may be instrumental in recording and publishing the statistical story of these war years, the magnitude and scope and variety of the statistical studies undertaken, the new methods developed, the frantic search for trained statisticians to man the various important enterprises, the fateful decisions which were made as a result of statistical information, perhaps also those decisions which were made without the benefit of statistical advice or even in defiance thereof. obviously it is still too soon to record this story, too many things are still ""confidential"" and the chief protagonists in the vast enterprise are still too heavily burdened to be diverted from their more immediate tasks. ultimately, when pressures relax a little, the organization of this record would do much to stimulate the profession and also to inform the thoughtful public and thus to create a climate of opinion more favorable for the progress of statistical investigations. fully as striking as the current increase in statistical activity is the expansion of the mathematical theory of statistics which has been rapidly gaining momentum in recent years. to anyone who reads even the titles of papers in the theoretical journals it is obvious that here is a development of tremendous vitality, power, and far reaching significance. every major statistical idea has two natures, two faces. there is the world of mass phenomena, apprehended by the senses, in which at first acquaintance chaos appears to reign. variation from individual to individual, from sample to sample, appears to be the one universal and inescapable fact. yet underneath the apparent confusion the acute observer detects a measure of uniformity, there are discernible patterns in the way these individuals fluctuate, there are relationships which dominate the swarming inconsistencies, there are limits beyond which uncertainty does not pass. there is also an abstract world of definitions, postulates and proofs, quite distinct from the sensory universe of stochastic phenomena. the abstract structures of this latter world form mathematical models which at certain points appear to match the sensory phenomena in much the same way that a road map matches the countryside. without the services of the mathematical map maker, the sensory phenomena cannot be satisfactorily explored. without the compelling pressure of practical situations demanding exploration, the mathematical theory might develop in abstract sterility, beautiful, complete, but useless. the competent research worker must have acquaintance with both worlds, else he is likely to assume a false parallelism between his concrete data and some convenient but inapplicable mathematical pattern. but very few statistical workers are fully at home both in the concrete data of a substantive field and in the mathematics upon which statistical theory depends. therefore one of the tasks of interpretation which i believe the statistical association should assume is that of closing the gap which now seems to separate the man who considers himself a theorist from the man who considers himself a practical statistician. we must find a way of persuading some of the clearest thinkers among the mathematical group to write really outstanding expository papers clarifying the more fundamental logical ideas and describing and illustrating the more important new techniques, omitting mathematical proofs but giving references to sources in which they can be found. i use the word ""persuading"" because the present dearth of such obviously valuable papers seems to imply that this is not the kind of writing which people do for their own recreation. if pointing out the urgent need of such articles is not enough, then the association must devise other incentives to secure them such as special publications, a section of specially invited papers in the journal or an annual lecture series. the rapidity of the expansion of statistical theory makes such expository papers continually more essential. a few years ago, one who devoted a large proportion of his time to the serious study of statistics could expect to read most of the important papers in the field. now we appear to be entering an era when theory expands so fast that no one who does much work of his own can hope to find time to read all the significant contributions of other writers. even among mathematical statisticians an increasing amount of specialization may be inevitable in the not too distant future. perhaps we may also find a way to bring to the attention of that relatively small group of persons who are creatively extending the mathematical theory of statistics some of the problems which the creative practitioner feels need theoretical attention. the extension of the theory itself does not seem to me to be the province of the statistical association, but providing a means of communication through which various members of the statistical guild, with diverse talents, may better understand each other, so that they may wholeheartedly work together and so that our whole profession may unitedly serve our day and generation that seems to me to be one of the chief reasons why there should be an statistical association and why it is worthy of the devoted service of its members. we may hope that the notable expansion of statistical activity and the impressive clarification of statistical logic to which i have referred will entail a greater respect for statistical thinking on the part of the general public and an increased willingness on the part of legislators to be guided by statistical analyses but we certainly cannot take that outcome for granted. we have not yet reached that happy era described by m. g. kendall in an address to the royal statistical society ""when the man in the train who begins his remarks with 'of course, i am not a statistician,' does so with a sense of humility and not, as at present, with an air of quiet satisfaction at freedom from a serious mental disfigurement."" although a research worker in any branch of science needs statistics as a research tool and as a logical pattern for thought, the science curricula in our universities seldom require the study of statistics until a late stage of specialization is reached, if they require it at all. had he been exposed to a good general course in statistical method in the early part of his college career, many a scientist would have seen reasons for seeking thorough training in statistical method. and would not need to spend the rest of his life bemoaning his inability to read fundamental research papers in his own field. over fifty years ago, florence nightingale writing to sir francis galton made an eloquent plea for ""some teaching how to use statistics in order to legislate for and to administer our national life with more precision and experience,"" and commented that ""though the great majority of cabinet ministers, of the army, of the executive, of both houses of parliament have received a university education, what has that university education taught them of the practical application of statistics?"" in 1944 it is still an unusual lawmaker who consults scientific rather than political oracles. here then is another major need of interpretation, the interpretation of the purposes and general nature of statistical investigation to the non statistician. if executives overrule the recommendations of their statistical research bureaus it is relatively unfruitful to blame the executives, we will do better to try to find ways to educate them. if the public fails to value and support statistical research, we must take some of the blame ourselves in that we have failed to insist that the nature of statistical thinking is an appropriate topic for inclusion in a liberal education. we may well ponder the relationship between the remarkable discoveries made in the physical sciences in recent years and the increased popular interest in scientific topics, noting that certain of the greatest of scientists have considered it worth their while to serve as interpreters of scientific research to the layman. their willingness to share with the public as much of scientific information as the public could grasp has helped to create a general readiness to support scientific research, an increased demand for the services of trained scientists, and sometimes even an over valuation of the possibilities of scientific inquiry. in contrast to the worker in the physical sciences, the statistician is still popularly misunderstood and the outcome of statistical studies too often misprized. even as the great scientists have exercised a stimulating and regenerating influence upon the scientific education of the non scientist, it is time for the leading statisticians to put serious thought upon the statistical education of the non statistician. one medium for such education might be articles couched in non technical language, addressed to the intelligent layman, and appearing in non statistical periodicals, such as the article on quality control published by fortune in october of last year. a general college education is designed to help its possessor understand the modern world and adjust himself intelligently to it, but i have never heard of a liberal arts college that undertook to explain to its students the stochastic nature of the universe in which they live and move and have their being, or even to assist them to acquire certain general and very simple but very important statistical concepts. it would seem highly appropriate for the statistical association to call this matter to the attention of college administrators. let us look briefly at some of the statistical ideas needed in his personal life by the intelligent individual who never expects to do even the simplest statistical work. the ability to read simple graphs and tables is now widely accepted as an essential part of a general education and is taught in almost every junior high school. nevertheless college students habitually skip over the graphs and the tables in their texts. in this vital aspect the arts of communication appear to be incompletely mastered. the approximate nature of all measurement should be taught in the secondary school but seldom is. this is a pity, for it is easy to devise simple experiments which will make the inescapable unreliability of measurement unforgettable even to immature students, and will even give them the concept of a frequency distribution of errors of observation . the universality of human variability is an important concept which if more widely recognized would spare much individual anxiety. a very common fallacy which has extremely bad social consequences is the assumption that if the mean of group a is considerably larger than the mean of group b every individual in group a must exceed every individual in group b. vast possibilities for social mischief are inherent in that mistake, especially when it is made the basis of discriminatory practices affecting all members of a group. concomitance is so ubiquitous a phenomenon that the statistician is likely to suppose it is ubiquitously understood. if however he listens attentively for a few hours to the conversation of a group of college graduates innocent of statistical training, he can usually pick up a fairly choice collection of boners. they confuse concomitance with causation. they express surprise that where a high relationship has been noted some individual departs from the group trend. they are troubled when the offspring of brilliant parents appear less brilliant than those parents. they think a child who has the highest lq. in his group should be expected to stand highest in all other traits and is to be censured if he does not. even without the computation of a single coefficient of correlation, much could be done to correct this kind of unintelligent thinking. the idea that the examination of a relatively small number of randomly selected individuals can furnish dependable information about the characteristics of a vast unseen universe is an idea so powerful that only familiarity makes it cease to be exciting. to many laymen it still looks like legerdemain. they tend either to draw positive conclusions from a single case or to suspect the evidence from a random sample of, say 1000, on the ground that ""only a thousand cases is a very small proportion of the whole population."" yet only rarely does any person get through a single day without encountering some form of sampling. here indeed is a dilemma. the statistician is aware that real understanding of statistical inference comes only through years of study and is aghast at the temerity of trying to tell the layman anything about it, and so the layman goes on daily making erroneous judgments about practical affairs. unfortunately those practical affairs are not always the private concern of the man himself. sometimes they are your affairs and my affairs and the affairs of all citizens. the man to whom no one in college tried to teach anything about sampling may later become the chairman of an important committee in one of the state governments or in the federal government and he may insist on a complete enumeration when an inquiry by sample would have cost far less and would have made all the needed information available more speedily. or he may block the investigation altogether. could a cultural, non technical undergraduate course have helped him? certainly it could. it could show him the practical difference between biased and representative samples and could help him to become aware of subtle sources of bias in his own special field. participation in drawing a series of random samples from a known population could give him some idea of how the various statistics of those samples fluctuate about the population values, what a standard error is, how the sampling distribution takes form, that not all statistics have the same form of sampling distribution, and that the variability of the statistic shrinks as sample size is increased. it could make vivid to him the idea that generalizing from a sample to its population involves uncertainty, but only a limited and predictable amount of uncertainty. the two risks of error in testing a statistical hypothesis have their counterpart in his everyday experience. he should understand that the conscious study of these two risks is one of the unique aspects of statistical method, is something which no other system of thought attempts. where the teachers of such classes could be obtained is the chief problem. while the instruction i am discussing would be almost devoid of mathematics, it can certainly not be given by one who knows nothing of the underlying theory. the teaching of classes in which the emphasis is primarily cultural is intrinsically far more difficult than the teaching of classes in which the emphasis is professional. i can only repeat my earlier statement that we must move on many fronts at one time, and ultimately there will be available a supply of teachers not only for technical but also for cultural instruction. another kind of interpretation which may be usefully undertaken by a professional association is that of helping workers in one substantive field become acquainted with methods developed in other fields. in earlier days, most of the members of the statistical association came from the fields of economics and sociology. now, however, the association is receiving more and more members with major interests in public health, in psychology, in the natural sciences, in quality control, in mathematics, in education, and it will thus acquire both greater opportunity and greater responsibility for this kind of cross fertilization among its own members. in addition we should consider thoughtfully the opportunities for collaboration with other professional associations in fields in which statistics is an important research method but not the chief focus of interest. such collaboration may take the form of joint committee action on some project to which our group can render special assistance in the methods of investigation; or it may lead to a more inclusive, more permanent, more structural pattern of cooperation among a group of national societies with statistical interests. preliminary steps leading in this direction will be reported tomorrow, but i want now to say that 1. believe a federation or consolidation or structural pattern of cooperation among national statistical organizations so that they can effectively act as a single body will further the purposes we have been discussing. and now let us consider the inner health of the statistical association itself, for a strong organization is needed to serve its own members and society adequately. the statistical association needs a better structural pattern in order to function efficiently. initial steps have been taken to effect such improvement and a constitutional amendment intended to facilitate change will be presented at the business meeting. the association would be greatly strengthened if its membership were increased to include most of the persons actively engaged in statistical work in america. it is a safe guess that if our present members would make it their business to recommend their eligible colleagues and associates, our numbers could be quickly doubled, perhaps trebled. if the association is to exert its maximum influence, it must have strong roots in local communities, must develop strong chapters which are a potent influence for the improvement of state and local statistical activities. there must be a close working relationship between chapters and parent association by means of which each reinforces the other. the strength of a professional organization is the responsibility of every individual member thereof. is he willing to accept committee responsibilities even when they are personally inconvenient? is he enough interested in the development of the organization to put his mind to work on its problems, to volunteer ideas, to attend business as well as program sessions, to read and think about an annual report? 'we can have an association so strong and so effective that it raises to a new level the opportunities for statisticians and the prestige of their profession, but only if enough of us put constructive effort into its activities. again returning to my original thesis concerning the objective of the statistical association, i shall close with a quotation from george barton's biography of the great belgian statistician, adolphe quetelet, who was the first foreign member of the statistical association: i like to think of the constant presence in any sound republic of two guardian angels: the statistician and the historian of science. the former keeps his finger on the pulse of humanity, and gives the necessary warning when things are not as they should be. the historian of science or let us say simply the historian (for in the future every historian will have enough scientific training to appreciate the importance of science)will not allow humanity to forget its noblest traditions or to be ungrateful to its greatest benefactors. if the statistician is like a physician, the historian is like a priest, the guardian of man's most precious heritage, of the one treasure which, whatever may happen, can never be taken away from him for the past is irrevocable. humanity must be protected by the watchful statistician, and it must be sustained in its newer and bolder efforts by the consciousness of every antecedent effort, to which it owes its culture, its dignity and its excellence.",136,31.0147058823529,5.17543859649123,0.294215267899478,4218,1241,22.1515389925529,17.1515389925529,77,1.40590822843031,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1945.10500719"

Shewhart","1940-1969","the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki have made the world conscious, as perhaps no other event has done, of the potential significance of applied science. this war revealed to all that the cooperation of scientists on a gigantic scale literally revolutionized the method of carrying on wars. by the grace of god, the nations of the world have been given another chance to live in peace another chance to explore the endless frontier of science in search of new ways of constructively serving mankind. most people will agree that the problems of war are inherently simpler than those of attaining the full advantages of science in a world at peace. for war is a simple business in the sense that the objectives are clear and heartily supported by an overwhelming majority of the citizens of a nation; whereas peace time problems do not have the same dramatic intensity, immediacy, and urgency to each citizen. however, the atomic bomb has brought people to appreciate the importance of the end to which science is applied. all shudder at the thought of the destructiveness of another war; all like to dream of the world of tomorrow in which the object of applied science is the satisfaction of human wants. however, these wants cannot be scientifically determined without appeal to the sampling procedures of the statistician. to the citizen of a democracy there is certainly some dramatic significance in the fact that the statistician must be called in to sample human wants in order that science may be applied effectively in peace. it seems fitting that, at this first annual meeting after the catastrophic war through which we have just passed, our attention should be directed toward the role that statistics can play in the years ahead in making science serve humanity and toward the role that statisticians can play in giving each individual some appreciation of the dramatic intensity, immediacy, and urgency to him of some of the problems that the statistician alone can solve. with this thought in mind, i have chosen to speak on the advancing front of statistics in its service, directly and through other scientists, to the members of society as individuals. if statistics can be made to minister to all the people, if the majority of the people can be made to realize this contribution of statistics, if those who practice statistics follow a strict code of conduct, if statisticians assume their responsibility for the proper training of neophytes before turning them loose as statisticians, then the future of the statistical profession is assured. in the established sense of the term ""profession"" as applied to law, medicine, and religion, there is an implication of a devotion to a higher purpose than that of personal profit or the earning of a livelihood. tonight i wish to keynote ministering to the people at large as an essential requirement of any profession. at some time or other between the cradle and the grave, everyone of us calls upon members of the medical, legal, and religious professions. in so far as these serve us well, we come to appreciate them as members of their profession because we recognize that through long years of study and training they have placed themselves in a position to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. if statistics can be made to serve each of us in a way that we individually recognize and appreciate, statisticians will no longer be referred to in some quarters as the showgirls of the market place because they live by their figures alone. the high purpose of a diverse group can be built up and maintained only by an effective organization. by getting a perspective of the advancing research front and the vast armies of pure and applied scientists with whom we must cooperate if we are to make our greatest contribution to the service of science, we can come to realize fully the need for a strong professional statistical organization. three types of scientific research as a background for what follows, it is essential that we distinguish between three broad and somewhat overlapping categories of research. in the recent report,' ""science, the endless frontier,"" by vannevar bush, director of osrd, to the president of the united states on a 1 united states government printing office. washington. 1945. program for post war scientific research, the following three categories of research are recognized and briefly described: pure research, background research, and applied research and development. pure research is there defined as research without specific practical ends. it is directed toward the acquisition of knowledge and the understanding of nature and its laws. background research is typified by the collection of economic, business, census, meteorological, and other types of data; the determination of physical and chemical constants; and the establishment of standards of quality for foods, drugs, and other manufactured materials. applied research is generally directed toward some practical end determined by human wants and it is usually expected that the cost of such research will be met through the benefits that accrue from the research itself. the statistical front in the three fields of research pure research. since the turn of the century, great progress has been made in extending the statistical front in pure research. advances have been made in the field of the statistical description of stellar phenomena by chandrasekhar and others; in the development of statistical mechanics by einstein, bose, fermi, dirac and others; in the statistical description of meteorological phenomena; and in the development of statistical theories in genetics and many other fields. statistics has progressed also in psychometrics and econometrics. butperhaps the greatest progress within the past two decades has been in the field of mathematical statistics along the lines typified by the abstract material published in the annals of mathematical statistics. such work has been highly individualistic. much of it has been done by those unknown to most of the members of the statistical association. in fact, many of those who have done most to extend the frontiers of mathematical statistics are not known officially as statisticians: even r. a. fisher, hotelling, and wilks are not listed as statisticians in their college registers. likewise the men who have contributed to the knowledge of nature through the application of statistics are seldom known to their fellow scientists as statisticians but rather as professional men in the subject matter field wherein they contributed. statistics, in other words, has no particular subject matter field solely unto itself. moreover, most of the contributions of statistics to the different subject matter fields are mathematical in character; and in so far as such contributions are mathematical, it is little wonder that fellow scientists often question the existence of a statistical front as such. many think simply of the different subject matter fronts while others think of statistics as a part of the mathematical front. let us pause to examine the significance of this situation from the viewpoint of professional organizations in the field of statistics. to maintain an advancing front in pure statistical research both in the subject matter fields and in mathematics requires support as does pure research in every field. it is perhaps true that each subject matter field, in so far as pure research is concerned, can obtain support for the development of the statistical aspects of nature essential to that field. those engaged in pure research in the separate fields will undoubtedly recognize the need for courting the mathematical statistician engaged in extending the boundaries of mathematical statistics per se, for perhaps never before in the history of science have scientists in the subject matter fields appreciated so wholeheartedly the contributions of mathematics. in fact, seierrtists are coming more and more to realize that most, if not all, theories of nature are mathematical in character at least to the extent that the idealized abstract models of natural phenomena are described in mathematical terms. there is, of course, a need for the mathematical statistician to come into contact with the problems revealed by nature in the separate sciences if mathematics is to contribute to the solution of such problems. those working to extend the boundaries of mathematical statistics need to have an organization such, for example, as the institute of mathematical statistics to serve as a go between for pure.mathematics on the one hand and pure science on the other. to their fellow researchers in other fields of pure science men working in this realm of statistics will probably always be known primarily as mathematicians. certainly to those working in the fields of background and applied science and to the public, such statistical research workers will probably always be known as mathematicians. hence, so long as we think of the contributions of statistics to pure research, we may question the need for an organization beyond that of mathematical statisticians. when"" however, we consider the service to the public of pure statistical research through its contributions to background and applied research, we find that an organization representing the common interests of all statisticians is a necessity. otherwise we cannot fulfill our obligations to the public upon which we must depend in the end for recognition and support. background and applied research. turning to the fields of background and applied research, three points should be kept in mind: 1) such research must involve the cooperation of many individual applied scientists, sometimes literally hundreds, 2) such research is directed toward obtaining knowledge useful to many individuals and sometimes to practically the whole public, and 3) the usefulness of such work must be recognized by those who receive the benefits in order to gain their financial and other support: applied research must pay its own way. what i want to do is to indicate in some detail the endless field open to the statistician in applied research and to indicate briefly some of the problems involved in obtaining the cooperation of individual applied scientists and of groups of applied scientists in carrying out a few major lines of application that are of significance to the public. first, let us consider simply the background research of standardization as carried on by groups like the standards association and the society for testing materials. work on standardization projects often requires the cooperation of many different kinds of scientists representing the public, industry, and government: the number of such projects runs into thousands. each such standard is, in general, arrived at through committee action often extending over several years: many compromises must be made, some because of a lack of scientific knowledge, some because of economic requirements, and some because of other limitations. each standard must be, as it were, a tailor made job that is satisfactory to different group interests. most of the applied scientists cooperating in such a project are not familiar with statistical theory and application; many of them are, in fact, antagonistic to the statistician. yet these scientists are in the saddle and decide what shall be done. even if we assume that we have the ideal condition in which a standardizing committee is completely sold on the applications of statistics, there remains the problem of translating the contributions of the statistician into the written specification in a way that will be understood by those who use it a group that often includes hundreds of people; indeed in the case of aconsumer standard, thousands of people. the problem of putting statistics to work in standardization, one of the fields of background research touching all of us as consumers of foods, drugs, and other manufactured goods,is a tremendous job calling for the cooperation of applied scientists working not only as individuals but as groups. this is not a problem that can be solved by statisticians working independently: yet in its solution there is room for hundreds of scientists with basic training in statistics. in applied research, let us consider only industrial research. in 1942 there were 2254 industrial research laboratories: today there are many more. yet i doubt that many of the directors of these laboratories have any appreciation of the potential contributions of statistics. in 1939 there were 184,230 manufacturing firms in the united states: today there are perhaps as many or more. yet i doubt that management in any but a few of these firms is aware of the potential contributions of statistics. of course, many employ statistical clerks and a few may even employ one or more persons called statisticians but their statistics is usually limited to business and economics. there is a big gap to be filled between the contributions of the mathematical statistician in the annals, for example, and the appreciation of the value thereof on the part of management in any large percentage of industrial laboratories and manufacturing firms. nevertheless, statisticians have a great opportunity in this almost unlimited field to serve the public at large as users of the manufactured goods turned out. the contribution of statistics in these two fields of applied research lies not so much in solving the problems usually put to the statistician by those not statistically trained as in helping to coordinate the steps of specification, production, and inspection. this may be considered as a scientific experiment for making the most efficient use of human effort in the production of goods to satisfy human wants. the long range contribution of statistics depends not only upon getting many highly trained statisticians into industry but also upon creating a statistically minded new generation of those physicists, chemists, engineers, and others who will develop and direct the mass production processes of tomorrow. let us look at the problem of interesting the members of professional organizations in the three fields of pure, background, and applied research. broadly speaking, professional scientific organizations may be classified under these three headings although the boundaries are not distinct. at the pure research level, we have those organizations representing the basic natural and social sciences; at the level of applied research, we have large professional groups such as the engineering societies, several of which have memberships of 20,000 or more; at the level of background research we have the society for testing materials, the standards association, and certain trade associations. by and large, these professional groups with a combined membership of more than a hundred thousand are responsible for the development of the scientific research front. these groups in the end will determine to what extent, if any, statistical methods will be used in their work. we must first get the membership of these scientific groups to give us a chance to show how statistics can help. then we must work in close cooperation with these groups in putting statistics to work for the public good. statisticians must assume a large part of the responsibility for finding out how they can best serve the thousands of scientists in the different subject matter fields and then they must cooperate with other professional groups in the different subject matter fields to see that statistical method is applied wherever it will yield useful results. three ways of serving fellow scientists three ways of serving fellow scientists are through joint meetings, through joint committees, and through publications. for years our association has been accustomed to holding joint meetings with other groups, particularly in the social sciences. more recently joint meetings have been held with the institute of mathematical statistics and the biometrics section has held many joint programs with groups having interests similar to theirs. by and large, however, there have been no joint meetings with the majority of the scientific groups primarily responsible for pure research in other than social science fields nor with the many large groups responsible for background and applied research. a joint committee type of approach to applied research in engineering was started in 1929. in that year e. b. wilson, then president of the statistical association, cooperated with a small group of statisticians in getting the interest of certain professional engineering groups in setting up what was and is called the joint committee for the development of statistical applications in engineering and manufacturing. this committee was actively sponsored by the statistical association, the society for testing materials, the society of mechanical engineers, and the mathematical society. the membership was made up of two representatives from each of these societies. this committee, working in cooperation with the officers of the sponsor societies, has been largely influential in initiating most of the activities that have taken place since then in organizing statistical effort in the engineering field. it was also realized at that time by the same group of statisticians that it was desirable to launch a committee interested in the application of statistics to the background research of standardization. such a committee was set up and has been active ever since in the society for testing materials. a short time before the war another small group of statisticians recognized the desirability of getting formal action on the application of statistics in quality control through the standardization of simplified methods. with the cooperation of the war department and the standards association a committee was set up under the auspices of the amerian standards association. this committee turned out three emergency war standards in statistical quality control and these were used extensively not only in america but also in australia, canada, and england. during the early years of the war, there were often discussions by the board of the statistical association about the need for a joint committee representing some of the major fields of war research, more nearly on the pure research level, to act in an advisory capacity on the applications of statistics. nothing was done officially by the association, but statisticians working independently in cooperation with the officers of the national research council and particularly with dean eisenhart, chairman of the division of physical sciences, organized in 1943 a committee on applied mathematical statistics with subdivisions on physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, mathematical statistics, biology, and engineering. this committee has had from the beginning liaison members with the war and navy departments and the war production board. more recently, liaison representation has been secured on the part of the national physical laboratory of great britain and the council for scientific and industrial research of australia. the latest development in this organized committee effort is the establishment of a committee, under the joint direction of the national research council and the social science research council, charged with the study of the scientific problems of measuring public opinion, attitudes, and consumer wants. much of the work of these committees has been of an advisory nature. for example, the joint committee on engineering, which is now sponsored not only by the original sponsors but also by the institute of mathematical statistics and the institute of electrical engineers, has cooperated with different engineering groups in setting up special committees on the application of statistics within these groups and in arranging for the presentation of papers on applied statistics on the programs of many of the engineering societies. just recently such a committee was set up in the institute of electrical engineers. some of these committees have operated to secure not only national cooperation but also international. for example, the joint committee, through its sponsors, was influential in starting the movement in great britain that led to the organization of a committee under the auspices of the british standards institution. interest thus aroused has been credited by our english friends as the spark that started the movement which led to the formation of the agricultural and industrial research section of the royal statistical society. to date, however, such effort has been largely individualistic even perhaps to the extent that few statisticians in either the statistical association or the institute of mathematical statistics are aware of it. furthermore, these committees have only scratched the surface of the work that needs to be done by way of cooperation with other scientific groups. perhaps they set a pattern, however, that deserves more study on the part of those interested in the statistical profession. in passing, it may be remarked that in setting up such joint committees it seems desirable that at least two representatives be chosen from each participating group. one should be an ""elder statesman"" in the subject matter field of the group, in addition to being a person who is broad minded and interested in all new developments that might contribute to the work of his profession. at the same time he should be a sympathetic but hard boiled critic. the other representative should not only be qualified in the particular subject matter field but also in the technical applications of statistics in that field. let us turn now to the problem of serving our fellow scientists by means of publications. at least two media must be considered: journals of the many different scientific organizations, and a thoroughly up todate statistical journal containing methodological and subject matter articles of general interest to statisticians working in the three fields of research. to date, statisticians working as individuals have published articles in many professional journals, and the editorial board of the journal of the statistical association plans to provide a journal of high calibre that will carry material of broad general interest. for example, the article by wald in the september issue of the j asa is of potential interest to members of many professional organizations in the field of pure and applied science. hence progress is being made. however, we still have a long way to go in developing a well thoughtout plan for reaching the thousands of scientists in different subject matter fields. three ways of serving the public let us now consider some of the ways in which statisticians serve the public. as already noted, it is essential for the existence of a strong professional organization that the public recognize to some extent the service rendered by its members. if, for example, the public becomes aware that by extending the use of statistics in many fields of research the potential contributions of that research in satisfying human wants may be maximized, it will not only appreciate the statistician but it may also bring pressure to bear wherever necessary to see that desirable applications of statistics are made. since, as already noted, the professional scientific groups in the separate subject matter fields mainly determine the extent to which statistics will be used, i shall use the three fold classification of contributions of research that are essential to the public proposed in dr. bush's report. these are in the war against disease, in the maintenance of national security, and in increasing public welfare. by adopting this classification we may more easily see how the need for the contribution of the statistician fits into the picture of the need for scientific progress presented in this report and now being discussed so extensively in scientific literature. war against disease. the study of vital statistics, including the study of epidemics and the causes of disease, was one of the earliest fields to which statisticians contributed. statistical studies to determine hereditary susceptibility to disease have long been of interest from the viewpoint of preventive medicine. the determination of the effects of drugs and medical treatments is inherently a very complicated sampling process. statistical methods, of course, have been long used in studying the effects of specific drugs in the laboratory. here statistics plays an important part not only in the interpretation of results but also in the design of efficient experiments. statistics also plays an important role in the study of the effects of different kinds of bacteria, climatic conditions, and the like, on health. it should not be hard to get across, even at the high school level, some appreciation of such uses of statistics. in the whole field of foods and dietetics the public could be made to appreciate something of the importance of statistics. national security. for years government agencies have employed most of the statisticians. their services have long been recognized as of great importance in the collection and assembly of factual information about the supply and demand of labor as well as the supply and demand of manufactured goods and agricultural products. the statistician has for years played an important part in agricultural experimentation, in the study of social trends and in the general field of economics. in so doing, he has made available information of great value to those responsible for planning national security. however, at the beginning of the present war there was little appreciation of the value of the statistician in government other than in the fields mentioned above. even in setting up the national roster, the profession of statistics was given little recognition. however, during the war this situation was greatly modified. within such agencies as the war and navy departments, the war production board, the office of the surgeon general, and the national defense research committee, statisticians were given a chance to make important contributions. these extended beyond the business and social fields into the fields of background and applied research in the natural sciences. if and when the record can be made public, we will find a surprisingly large contribution to the war effort in the fields of personnel placement, operational research, development of improved war materials, and the control of the quality of much of the material used by the armed forces. however, the organization of such statistical effort depended primarily upon the initiative of small groups of statisticians. had we had at the beginning of the war, a strong professional organization interested in all fields of applied research, i think that our contribution would have been even greater. prior to the war statisticians had not given sufficient attention to the developing front of statistics along new lines, particularly in the field of applied natural science. organized planning was so inadequate that there were not enough statisticians qualified even to teach the large numbers of technicians required. from the viewpoint of future security, a strong professional organization is needed to keep building sufficient public support for the many new fields of application that are likely to be of use in developing our national security. moreover, if the potential contributions of statistics in this field are to be realized, much remains to be done in getting across to a large percentage of the public the part played by statistics in this war. professional organizations in other fields of applied science have already taken steps to get recognition for their work. in the statistical association, the officers and many of the members have given much consideration to this problem. one of the steps being considered is the publication of technical articles in the j asa to acquaint all statisticians with war time contributions. this, however, is not enough. we need to reach great numbers of people who never see the j asa. through short articles and editorials in the press and popular magazines, an effort should be made to indicate in an understandable manner not only the contributions that statistics made in the war but also the necessity of continually developing such applications as a part of any plan for security. public welfare. in a democracy, public opinion and attitudes play an important role. in so far as public policies are determined upon the basis of public opinion, it is certainly of interest to everyone that such opinion be measured in the best possible way. all of you are well aware of the complicated statistical sampling problems as well as the psychological, economic, and other problems involved in the measurement of public opinion. however, it would not be extremely difficult, i believe, to make most people have an appreciation for some of the more elementary statistical problems involved. even a group of men sitting around an old pot belly stove in a backwoods general store could be made to see the fallacy in the literary digest poll. if the public can be convinced of the importance of using adequate statistical care in such work, is it not reasonable that they would support a professional organization that would assume the responsibility for providing adequate statistical techniques for those working in this field and for acquainting the public with information that will help individuals to form valid judgments on questions involving public opinion. it seems to me that this is one of the public services that the association can render. another example of the usefulness of statistics to all individuals is the establishment of consumer standards of quality. one aspect of this problem of particular interest is that it requires the cooperation not only of applied natural but also of applied social scientists. much work, of course, has been done by members of the marketing research association, by certain government agencies, and by standardizing groups. success in this field is, of course, closely tied up with success in solving the problems involved in measuring public opinion and attitudes. so far, a large part of the work in consumer standards has been in determining preferences between things known to the consumer. in many cases, more needs to be done by way of determining what might sell, and what might give even greater satisfaction to customers. here i am thinking primarily of what might be done at the applied research level by a team composed of physicists, chemists, psychologists, economists, market research men, statisticians, and possibly physiologists in solving some of the problems of establishing consumer standards. during the past two years, these problems have been discussed in several issues of the bulletin of the society for testing materials and the standards association publication. to make further progress it is essential that statisticians, familiar with what is known at the present time about the science of measuring opinion and attitudes, cooperate with professional groups like the standards association and the society for testing materials to establish standards in terms of physical, chemical, and other properties. more than this, it would be highly desirable if we could find some objective physiological measure of human reactions that would be more reliable in many instances than verbal expression. the problem of standardization is difficult even when considered in terms of theoretically measurable characteristics of a product: when we couple with this the problem of determining in a quantitative manner the correlation between human reaction and physically measurable characteristics of manufactured goods, it is obvious that the problems are vastly more complicated. all of these problems are inherently statistical and unless statisticians as a professional group assume their responsibility in helping to solve them, statistics will have lost one of its great opportunities to serve the public in a way that the public can understand. if, on the other hand, these problems are attacked in a half hearted manner and are muffed, the day of full public recognition and appreciation of the statistician will be greatly delayed. in other words, we have here a frontier for applied statistical research of the highest order. we have here a problem in which the public is greatly interested' not only as individuals but as organized groups we have here a problem that the public wants solved. in closing this section on public welfare, let us consider briefly the question: what can statisticians contribute to general education? the recent report on general education in a free society, published by harvard university, gives the following definition of general education: ""it (general education) is used to indicate that part of a citizen's whole education which looks. first of all to his life as a responsible human being and citizen; while the term 'special education' indicates that part which looks to the citizen's competence in some vocation."" i have recently read not only the harvard report but many other discussions on general education and i am pleased to find that several emphasize the importance of some knowledge of scientific method as a part of general education. in a few cases, the authors mention statistics but not in a way that indicates any relationship to scientific method. this is not surprising because there has been little effort in statistical teaching to emphasize how statistical method is related to the three steps in scientific method, namely, hypothesis, experiment, and test of hypothesis. if the student were made to appreciate that, because of the statistical nature of observable phenomena, it is often necessary to replace the three steps by statistical hypotheses, statistically designed experiments, and statistical tests of hypotheses, he would appreciate the developing growth of scientific method and the contribution of statistics thereto. from the viewpoint of general education, statistics is not simply a tool as is so often stated but a scientific way of looking at the universe: statistical method is not something apart from scientific method but is scientific method adjusted to the generally accepted view that science is not exact but only probable. statistics is like the well dressed bride in that statistics ""wears"": something old: scientific method. something new: improvements on each of the three steps in scientific method. something borrowed: mathematics and logic. something blue: contributions in the ""blue chip"" class in every sub ject matter field. concluding remarks the statistical front is the whole field of science. outposts of that front exist in every subject matter field of research. many outposts are manned by small scouting parties of pioneering souls: others are well organized groups like the biometrics section of the statistical association, the econometric and psychometric societies, the institute of mathematical statistics, and the marketing association. some of these outposts have already advanced out of sight of the others; in no instance are the lines of communication adequate even worse, there is no available map showing the location, personnel, and objectives of these outposts. picture these outposts on the scientific frontier each with a mission to perform that is of vital interest to the public, but without anyone headquarters statistical organization to which appeals can be directed for the latest statistical results from the similar outposts in other fields of pure, background, and applied research; without anyone headquarters organization to stimulate the training of new recruits in the separate subject matter fields; without anyone headquarters organization to maintain adequate public support for their work vital to our national security, war against disease, and public welfare. to insure continued advancement on the statistical front, we need a strong professional organization backed by all statisticians working in the many different subject matter fields: an organization whose purpose shall be to foster in the broadest manner the science of statistics and its applications; and to promote a unified, effective, organized effort in advancing the common interests of all professional statisticians. to this end, such a professional organization needs to conduct joint meetings and conferences with many organizations in the fields of pure, background, and applied research with whom official contact has never been made in the past; to establish joint committees with other scientific groups wherever necessary; to produce and distribute publications devoted to statistical methodology and statistical knowledge of common interest to all professional statisticians; to provide the public through the press, lecture platform, and radio with reliable information about the science of statistics and its contributions; and to stimulate statistical research and promote high professional standards in all statistical work. i hope and believe that the statistical association with the cooperation of other organized societies interested in statistics, can be developed into a strong organization to serve the common interests of all professional statisticians in these groups.",244,24.2377049180328,5.25363544132567,0.201724721001015,5914,1193,19.5336552054863,14.5336552054863,33,1.23169148293602,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1946.10500754"

of statisticians, not so much because of the value and importance of the output of statistical material, but rather by the fact that figures statistical data were the central point of economic and social controversy through the greater part of the year. indeed, the battle of statistics was well under way before the year 1946 began. it came to the forefront in the automobile wage controversy; in the contention of the automobile workers union that wage rates could be raised by a certain amount without necessarily increas ing the cost of cars to the public. when this contention was denied and the union undertook to modify its demands, if management could prove by actual evidence that the wage increase could not be granted without an appreciable rise in production costs and hence in the price of its products, management, according to press dispatches, stood by its con stitutional rights to refuse to make such data available. there followed one of the longest and costliest strikes in the annals of the automobile industry, a strike that was finally resolved after granting a wage in crease of fairly considerable proportions. it is not intended here to question the right of management, as reported in the press, to refuse to reveal the details of its costs. that is an issue of public policy that is an integral part of our concept of the nature of private rights, and our concept of under what conditions an industry comes within what has been defined as a public utility. nor are we here concerned with the circumstances or the manner in which an agency of the federal government concluded that an increase of 194 cents was justifiable. nor are we concerned with the circumstances that finally led the management to grant the increase it made. what we are concerned with is the fact that we, you and i, do not know, and perhaps never will know, whether wages could have been increased 25 cents, 184 cents, 16 cents, or even 10 cents, without appreciably raising the labor cost of mak ing automobiles had the controversy been amicably settled without a shutdown, and had car production been continued through the period that the strike was in effect. judging by the profit and loss sheets of all of those involved the corporation, the workers who were out on strike and the purchasing public everybody lost in that first skirmish of the 1946 battle of statistics. the repercussions of the battle, incidentally, even permeated the staid and solemn precincts of this association, as those who were present at our meeting in cleveland last year will so well remember. a second important phase of the battle of statistics came to its fruition during the early months of the past summer, when a small but politically powerful group in the ranks of labor succeeded in stopping a certain appointment to one of the most important statistical offices in the federal government. the crime that the individual concerned was guilty of was that he had refused to yield to pressure to change a tried and tested method of compiling an index of the cost of consumers goods. the index was being used by the war labor board for wage determination purposes. to be sure; a logic failed in their attempt to eliminate the use of the index by the war labor board in wage determinations, certain representatives of labor undertook to discredit the scientific validity of the index itself. the fact that two committees of the most competent persons in the field of indexhumbers, after eareful and painstaking investigation, had placed its stamp of approval on the quality of data and the methods used in constructing the index, was of no moment. the fact that one of the committees had found that even after making allowances for certain factors that had been the basis of criticism on labor’s part,, the probable error in the index was not more than five percentage points in a total of 130 and had concluded that the index was a highly legitimate instrument for doing what it was set up to do that is, measure changes in prices of what the mass of consumers buy was of no concern. a competent government official had dared answer unjustified charges of statistical incompetency. for that, this official was no longer to be permitted to retain the leadership of a federal statistical agency whose product plays an important part in decisions and negotiations in almost every phase of our domestic economy. more recently, other statistical skirmishes have occurred involving labor productivity and the public ownership of electric power. at the present moment the battle still rages over the so called nathan report. time does not permit me to go into the details of the issues involved in these controversies. suffice it to say that in the case of labor productivity statistics certain employers have used published government figures to prove that the lag in the production of certain commodities is attributable to the lack of cooperation and inefficiency on the part of labor. the fact that labor is but one factor in the productive process and that the output per man or per man hour is a function of the supply of materials and parts that are made available by management has apparently been overlooked in the argument. the issue was simple. government figures showed that the output per man hour in certain industries is lower than before the war. labor is therefore responsible for the failure of production in particular lines of consumer goods to reach higher levels. such misuse of statistical data, or shall i say, the use of certain statistics for purposes for which they are not applicable, has in turn led to an attack upon the validity and integrity of the statistics themselves. in this particular instance charges have been publicly made by the representatives of a certain labor organization to the effect that the figures are unrepresentative and misleading and give a false picture of the trend in the productivity of labor. the fact that the output of workers in certain industries has fallen as compared with prewar years, a fact that any honest analysis of productivity figures could not avoid revealing, irrespective of the causes, many of which are outside the control of labor, appears to be beside the point. government data were being used by employers as the basis of certain charges against labor. accordingly, they must be made to appear untrustworthy. in the opinion of some, their collection and publication should even be suppressed. many of you have no doubt followed the recent controversy in the field of public ownership of electric power. in this instance a responsible trade association, by skillful manipulation of statistical and accounting data, undertook publicly to prove that the cost of generating electricity by the tva compared unfavorably with the costs in privately operated plants. by including the cost of all sorts of extraneous factors, entirely unrelated to the generation of tva power, costs which would have to be incurred for soil conservation, flood control, and navigation, even though the tva did not generate a single horsepower of electricity, the trade association in question made a very persuasive case. in the famous nathan controversy the battle waged all the way from how much nathan received from the cio for preparing his report, to whether labor is receiving more real wages today than before the war. little light has been thrown upon the validity of the data he has used, the assumptions he has made, and the justification of arriving at the conclusions he reached from the data that were available. as far as i can see, the fundamental issue that nathan raised, namely, can the out put of consumers goods, at present or expected production rates, be absorbed by our economy in 1947, without either lowering prices or increasing the earnings of labor, seems to have been entirely over looked. to many of you the various instances that i have here mentioned may appear to be mere passing phases of a difficult reconstruction era. personally, i am convinced that they are the more permanent symp toms of a maturing democracy, one of whose outstanding features is the growth in the number and power of pressure groups. the people, every section of our population, now knows how to read and write. and if they can’t, they can listen to the radio. able and efficient statistical analysts, and in some instances able manipulators of statistics, are available to all who wish to use them. statistical departments are no longer a luxury solely within the resources of prosperous trade associations, large corporations, advertising agencies or government departments. they are an integral part of our farm organizations, our labor movement, indeed, of every organized group in our community. all of them are keenly aware of the potency of statistics as a tool for influencing public opinion and for obtaining the ends they seek. they may be relied upon to make every possible use of this tool. during the coming year i believe we shall witness a still greater outpouring of statistical information and misinformation in the attempt to influence public policy by vested interests. the government of the united states is now embarking on a far reaching venture in international relations. it has accepted the postulate that rising standards of living through the world is one of the prerequisites of stable international relations. to this end it has committed itself to freeing and ex panding the channels of world trade. this undertaking involves radical changes in our own trade policies. it involves the further implementa tion of our reciprocal trade agreements, and a modification of our tariff policies along lines consistent with our position as a creditor nation. already the flood gates have opened. statistical proof of the danger to the nation of any downward revision of particular tariff classifica tions has already started to flow from certain trade associations, from certain labor groups, from certain emissaries of agriculture. rest as sured that there will be no lack of statistics and facts to make it appear that the private welfare of any group that feels that its economic position will be affected adversely, is synonymous with the public welfare and the maintenance of world peace. this is not to say or even to imply that any group should be de barred from the right of petition or of a hearing. that right must re main an essential of our system of democratic government. whether the ends sought by a particular group are in the public interest is for the people to decide for themselves. in this concept, however, lies the implication of a public opinion sufficiently enlightened to make intelligent decisions on what is best for the public interest. this, in turn, implies that there is available to our legislators and to the public at large, not only such information as is pertinent to the issues involved but also authoritative and inbiased analyses of the facts. unfortunately, the statistical activities of the federal and state gov ernments are still looked upon in many quarters as unnecessary and wasteful luxuries maintained at the taxpayers’ expense, primarily to provide jobs for favorites. this attitude is particularly prevalent today when economy in government and the political advantage of tax re duction hold high priority in certain circles. there is evidence from many directions of an oncoming attack upon “unnecessary” statistics. the collection of certain types of data that originated with the wartime activities of government has already been discontinued. other types are on the way to being discontinued. most of these data were essential to the intelligent wartime control of production, prices, inventories and wages, by the government. these government controls have now been abandoned. but has the elimina tion of such controls eliminated the need for adequate knowledge in these same fields, either by the government itself, or, more important, by industry, investors, farmers or labor? can business make intelligent decisions relative to its production program, its employ ment policies, or its price policies unless much of this same sort of in formation is availabie to it? the people, through their duly constituted representatives, have committed themselves to a policy of maintaining a high level of employment. under our system of enterprise the successful implemen tation of that policy lies in large part in the decisions and activities of private business. can private business make intelligent judgments with the type and quantity of statistical information now available to it, let alone what will be available if the present activities of the federal and state statistical agencies are curtailed as a result of budgetary cuts? the known attitude toward expenditures for government statistical activities and the present temper of some of those who will have weight in determining the budgets of the federal statistical agencies makes it incumbent on all of us, users and producers of statistics alike, to make every effort to see that the financial needs of the statistical senices are treated in a well considered and rational manner. it would indeed be well if the various appropriation committees could be persuaded to seek the advice of an impartial group from the statistical fraternity as to the probable effects upon the public interest of curtailing a given activity, before ordering budgetary cuts. the mere knowledge of the availability of such a group, officially constituted by a body such as this, would, i am convinced, lead to its being called upon for advice and guidance by certain enlightened members of some of the appropria tion subcommittees. and while dealing with the statistical activities of the federal govern ment may i add that it would be well at this time once more to assess the methods employed by the more important agencies in collecting and preparing statistical data. it is some 12 years since a careful analy sis has been made by an outside body of the methods and procedures of several of the larger federal statistical units. to that survey and the recommendation of those who took part in it must go a great part of the credit for the rise in the public acceptance of the prbduct of at least one government bureau with which i have had some acquaint ance. all of us who have had any experience either in the actual opera tion of washington agencies or who have had occasion extensively to use their materials are conscious of many shortcomings and the need for considerable improvement in certain statistical areas. i believe the time has come for the statistical association to establish a permanent committee to advise on the entire field of statistical standards. such a body could well be a part of its organizational structure. briefly, its membership should be of such professional stature that its findings and recommendations will be accepted by workers in the fields of statistics and by the public at large. it should be available, upon request, to government bodies to review existing or proposed statistical undertakings and pass judgment and make rec ommendations relative to the standards employed. to this extent it would serve in the same capacity as the committees on government statistics originally appointed by this association in 1933. it should, however, also serve as a tribunal which would analyze and render opinions on controversial issues concerned with statistical procedures and with the presentation of statistical materials. in this capacity it should be authorized, on its own initiative, as well as upon the request of responsible outside individuals or organizations, to investigate con troversies which in its opinion merit its attention. it should be evident that the existence of such a body would in no way preclude any member of the statistical fraternity from assuming the position of advocate in any issue which he might wish to sponsor or further. should such a committee on standards obtain the public ac ceptance that a properly constituted body should eventually merit, its existence and reputation would merely be notice to such an advocate that in any matter of comparable public interest there might be an advantage in maintaining certain standards whether the ends sought, be increases in wages, decreases in wages, higher prices or discrediting public ownership of electric power. i am quite certain that to many of you who have had to deal with committees of oongress, the idea of expecting an orderly consideration of the statistical activities of the federal agencies by appropriation committees will appear to be in the realm of fantasy. personally, i be lieve that there is a better chance of making a start toward that end in the year 1947 than most of us imagine. this is going to be a year of con gressional investigations in many instances for the purpose of reveal ing the inefficiency and wastefulness in federal departments. since investigations are going to be made anyway, why shouldn’t we as mem bers of the statistical fraternity work toward channelling them into constructive paths; so that the findings may lead to the advantageous revamping of statistical activities, improvements in quality and methodology, and greater uniformity? many of you will no doubt question the possible effectiveness of any body of this organization that undertook to pass judgment on the statistical standards of government and private agencies. here i can only teply that the tremendous part played by statistical data in arriv ing at judgments and decisions affecting every phase of our democratic society imposes upon us the responsibility of making available a mech anism which will provide the means for subjecting statistics to certain standards. one need merely bear in mind the part played by public opinion polls in arriving at political and business judgments to realize the stake that we as professional statisticians have in a publicly recog nized code of statistical standards. * * * within a few months, two years will have passed since the defeat of the nazi hordes. by good fortune we were spared the horrors of the devastation that befell our allies. we emerged with our productive facilities not only intact, but in many instances greatly enhanced. we emerged also with a greatly reinforced concept of the dignity of man and the realization that we can no longer live isolated from the rest of the work if peace is to prevail. whether we like it or not the world is looking to us to help rebuild its shattered economies. it has no other place to look for help. un less we accept our economic responsibilities in the international field, we will have only ourselves to blame if we find emerging throughout the world forms of government which are far different from what we had hoped to see grow out of the shambles of war. if we are to achieve the objectives for which we made such great sacrifices during the war, if the dignity of the human being and the freedom of the individual is to be universally recognized) we have no alternative other than to make still more sacrifices. to those who will say that we have done as much as we can afford, my only reply is: there is no limit to what we can afford in order to insure the friend ship of the world and the maintenance of our own system of democratic freedom and our system of private enterprise. but we must realistically face the fact that our ability to meet our responsibilities, that is, contribute to the rehabilitation and reconstruc tion of other countries by direct expenditures and granting of credits) will be determined almost entirely by how intelligently we cope with our own economic and social problems. unless business, agriculture, labor, and government accept their responsibility and have the states manship to make the adjustments necessary to maintain and to in crease our national output and keep employment at high levels, not only shall we fail the adherents of democracy in other lands, but the very structure of democracy here at home will be threatened. we in the united states cannot, during the next few years, run the risk of an economic collapse of any magnitude. the system of free enterprise cannot shoulder another shock of the amplitude of the early '30's. having seen what our economy can do when we are threat ened in war, the people will not complacently accept unem ployment in terms of tens of millions or a radical lowering of their standard of living. they will demand reforms and changes which in their opinion will be conducive to the full realization of the potentiali ties of our economic machine and to employment for those who desire to work. and we can rest assured that there will be many of different political and philosophical stripe who will promise them the attainment of that end. nor will the peoples of other countries willingly accept the importa tion of depression and mass unemployment from the u. s., a result which must inevitably follow a depression of any magnitude here at home. the opponents of our system of democracy abroad are avidly looking to an economic collapse in the u. s. before this decade is over, as practical proof of the inability of capitalism regularly to maintain high levels of employment. with the pronounced drift to the left throughout the world we can hardly hope to enlist or maintain an ar dent following for our way of life if we are unable to keep our economy on an expanding level. as has so well been said: freedom loving people are turning to us not only for assistance but as an example!” our ability to meet this responsibility, yes, this fundamental chal lenge, will to a large degree be determined by the availability and intel ligent use of pertinent, data bearing upon every phase of our economic and social structure. never before have facts, figures, and intelligent economic judgments been as important as they will be during the years immediately before us. never before has adequacy of data and statis tical integrity been so essential. for never before in history have the stakes involved been so high!

Thorp","1940-1969","those who operate in the field of foreign policy fall into one of two categories. first are the black haired, gaunt and cunning conspirators whose complicated and devious scheming is for objectives intended never to be apparent by methods which are sinister and super top secret. the other category includes the teadrinking, spat wearing butterflies who are too vacuous to have an objective and whose method is limited to charm, with the ""r"" relatively silent. unfortunately, neither of these pen and ink conceptions even hints at the backbone of present day foreign policy making and implementation, namely, careful theoretical and factual analysis by skilled technicians. an increasing number of major problems of foreign policy are of such a character that measurement and magnitude become elements of basic importance. it is worthy of note that recently, when a delegation from the united kingdom arrived to discuss with us a revision of the bizonal fusion agreement for germany, included in its impedimenta was a calculating machine. the classic ""s"" commodity list, beginning ""shoes and ships,"" has been out of date for some time due to the lamentable obsolescence of that colorful item known as sealing wax, but the new ""f"" list food, fuel, fibres, and fertilizer has top priority on the current foreign policy agenda of most governments and these items appear there almost entirely as problems of magnitude. today calories get more attention than kings. the slide rule, the calculating machine, and the statistical yearbook have become necessary tools of diplomacy. the statistical puzzles arising out of foreign policy problems naturally are as varied as the universe. they are not limited by subjectmatter, area, or time. what should be the number of whales permitted under the international whaling convention to be caught during the next whaling season in order to maintain a stable whale population, keeping also in mind the world shortage of fats and oils a neat problem in the vital statistics and caloric content of whales? what are the proper cost of living adjustment allowances to permit u. s. government representatives in various countries to maintain approximately equivalent living standards an index number problem with peculiar difficulties not merely for price level and foreign exchange reasons, but because of differing national customs of hospitality and patterns of protocol? what was the probable amount of destruction to property in italy arising out the war, and for which italy must make partial payment under the peace treaty a problem of statistical inference from quite fortuitous and incomplete sample data? what is the fair proportion between the united states and india for the shipment of raw cotton to japan under present controlled trade conditions a problem in which the accepted guiding principle requires the finding of a ""representative base period"" out of a most abnormal series of years? what is the relationship between the availability of tobacco products in the ruhr and the production of coal and steel a problem of psychological measurement since the proposal as made by several senators rests in the allegation that tobacco products are particularly effective as incentive goods? what amount of goods sent to russia under the lend lease program was presumably unused and undestroyed at the end of the war and thus subject to a negotiated settlement a problem in war time and peace time property life tables, and attrition and depreciation rates? this random list of a few problems may serve to establish the inference of the presence of statistics in the state department, but the record will be clearer if we consider two illustrations in somewhat fuller detail. in a world where there are desperate shortages of commodities, the problem of allocation has become a matter of prime importance. countries have become competing purchasers, and even, in a few tragic cases, competitors for relief assistance. the shortages are widespread and severe, and for many commodities there are few countries with an exportable surplus. foodstuffs are in this category and no government with any claim to responsibility can look away while its people are hungry. the state department has probably received more aidememoires, notes, memoranda, and formal and informal visitations from prime ministers, ambassadors, foreign technicians, and even selfappointed representatives, concerning the subject of food allocations than any other single topic during the last two years. the white house too has had distinguished callers on the same subject. the development and application of the concept of equitable food allocation, based on a careful examination of requirements and availabilities, was done first by a small international committee, then by the international emergency food council and is now in process of being taken over by the food and agriculture organization, one of the specialized agencies of the united nations. this international body makes recommendations to the supplying countries as to the proper distribution of their surpluses and these recommendations are followed with little variation. the problem is a most complex one. the basic unit for comparing food levels is the calorie, but unfortunately the simple definition in webster that a calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water one degree centigrade has not been so exact and indisputable when applied in the field of nutrition. two caloric tables for valuing foods are in general use now, one by the u. s. army and one by the international emergency food council. there are at least half a dozen other tables used in various parts of the world. the two principal ones vary in caloric content from ten to fifteen percent. similarly, the effort to measure various types of grain in ""wheat equivalent"" opens the door to a thorough state of confusion. it is self evident that when statisticians of many countries meet together to discuss a given problem, a primary requirement is that there be some common measure for setting down the facts and this has been a major task in the food field. although this does eliminate one standard area for professional controversy, there will always remain enough other factors of disagreement to permit full self expression. obviously, the first information required for making international allocations is that pertaining to the requirement and the indigenous supply in each country. if these can be satisfactorily determined, the import requirement follows merely by subtraction. at once it is necessary to remark that in many countries where industrial production is lagging the production of statistics is also below pre war both in quality and quantity. unfortunately, statistical organizations have been disorganized at the same time that the items to be measured have been subjected to wide variation. even as basic a datum as population must be approached through estimation. substantial movements of peoples have taken place, in addition to the abnormal effects of war on both birth and death rates. and none of the devastated countries has had the time or energy to take a post war census, necessary to obtain a relatively secure benchmark. similarly, agricultural production in most cases is measured much less accurately than before the war by the surviving statistical agencies in the various governments. and even less certain, both abroad and at home, are the important estimates of wheat and coarse grains consumed by man and beast on the farm and thus not moving into the available supply. however, on the basis of the pre war picture for which more reliable data are available, and the records for the past two years, including ration levels, the amounts imported, and the apparent stocks on hand, estimated import requirements for the current year, quarterly and by months, are worked out regularly by the experts. on the other side of the equation, the possible export surplus, three of the chief exporting countries have regularly indicated their availabilities as best they can. argentina, which provides about twenty percent of the world's exports of grain, bas not participated in the effort to plan the most effective distribution of the available supply. this unfortunate situation has been met in part by the other exporting countries through adjustment of the allocation to offset supplies obtained from the argentine. russia's exports, which have been limited in amount and have gone to very few recipient countries, have also not been subject to international allocation. but even the direct facts on immediate requirements and supplies are not enough to solve the problem. wheat, of course, is only one of many foods. it happens to be the cheapest form in which calories can be purchased in substantial quantities. in allocating wheat, the international committee must consider what other foods are available in the country with a wheat deficit. obviously, it is quite proper in the light of the world shortage to cut down on wheat shipments to countries wbich have a fair amount of other foods. even then, however, one must have some regard for the necessities of balanced diets. furthermore, food habits and food requirements must be considered. even in times of great need, a people does not change its way of eating over night. new foods are not easily introduced, even to a starving people, and established prejudices are surprisingly tenacious. for example, corn is not regarded as a proper food for human beings in a number of european countries, nor potatoes in the normal diet of italy, while rice is consumed much more than wheat in cuba. differences are not merely the result of taste. countries with long winters have different requirements from those in the tropics. and even in our own experience as an occupying power, we have recognized that a much higher caloric requirement is needed for germans than for japanese to maintain the same health level. so the statistician, in figuring the amount of wheat to allocate to any deficit nation, must have a clear picture of that country's historical eating habits and be familiar with its preferences and prejudices. finally, in considering the amount which is to be permitted to come from abroad, the allocations must not work in such a way as to punish the country which brings its maximum to the market place, or all enterprise and initiative in the direction of improved collections from the farms will be destroyed. conversely, there must be some penalty for failure to use the indigenous supplies most efficiently. since the beginning of the allocation procedure, it has always been true that the screened requirements for foodstuffs for all the deficit countries have totaled to substantially more than the availabilities, and here the really painful job begins the effort to determine where the requirements can be cut with the minimum of hardship. the figures of each country are reviewed again and again, and there are many conferences to explore various aspects of the situation more thoroughly. finally, the allocations are announced. at least, the process has made everyone aware of the limitations on supply and the urgency of the demands from other countries. these random comments about the allocation machinery may make the task appear exceedingly complex. but the fact remains that the job must be done. these formidable calculations, aimed to take into consideration both the overall requirements and supply situation, and the peculiar circumstances in each case, are the only hope of providing some basis of fairness and equity in the distribution of scarce things to people who are in desperate need of them. there is no question but that living for millions of individuals for the next few years at least, will have to continue under rationing and allocations of critical, scarce commodities. the people in these countries know that death from starvation is just as permanent as death from bombing. they know that allocations and rationing are protections to their lives that the rationing of milk, for instance, may cut down the number of fancy dishes served in fine hotels, but it does get the needed food to more mothers and infants for whom it is an essential. the international allocations in the same way are an effort more nearly to equalize the burden of the shortage on the people of the various countries, not leaving the distribution solely to ability to offer the highest bid or to the appeal of political sympathy, obligation or reward. the decision having been made to disregard economic bargaining or political discrimination and to place allocations on an objective basis, the key to this whole process becomes the little heralded statisticians both those who must present the case for their countries, and those who must screen the competing claims and bring them into a reasonable relationship with each other. the day and night work and worry is theirs, but they have built in large part upon the work of other statisticians whose work had gone before. i hesitate to think how impossible it would be to handle this problem had it not been for the continued collection and analysis of agricultural statistics and nutritional data in many countries for many years. as a second illustration may i speak briefly about the european recovery plan? the last six months have seen a most difficult and complex statistical undertaking in washington the examination of the requirements for european recovery and the study of the capacity of the economy and other economies to carry the european deficit in the meantime. this task has absorbed the full energies and capacities of many experts in many government agencies. the only relief for the central group directing the project was temporary when in a lighter moment they decided to call themselves the technical wizards on the european recovery program, or the twerps, for short. anyone familiar with washington during wartime can easily visualize the time and energy required to develop the details of a plan involving sixteen countries and a four and a quarter year period. i remember in the late twenties being told by a russian economist about the tremendous efforts required and the manpower devoted to drawing up the five year plan. last summer, i saw french economists and statisticians in a state of near exhaustion from working on the so called monnet plan. no one should regard an undertaking of this kind lightly. there have been no days, and even at times no nights, of rest. this project stems back, of course, to the suggestion by secretary marshall that the countries of europe get together, examine what their requirements will be over a period of time sufficient to permit them to put their economies on a self supporting basis, determine how much of these requirements they can meet separately and collectively, and thus indicate what additional help is needed to accomplish the program. sixteen of the western european nations met in paris last summer and, in an incredibly short period of weeks, drew up a program on which they could all agree. undoubtedly, this agreement was possible because the essential elements of european. recovery are beyond dispute that production must be substantially increased, sound currencies must be established, and the restrictions on trade must be reduced. their national requirements were presented and assembled. after some slight screening and reduction where the requirements were clearly beyond the possibility of supply, the so called deficit was calculated. this was all incorporated in the report of the committee of european economic cooperation which, together with a number of technical annexes, was sent to washington in september. statistics and work was already well under way in washington by that time, particularly with reference to the capacity of our own economy to meet such foreign demands and the effect of such an operation upon our own economic operations. but the review of the european plan has proved to be a most complicated undertaking. covering a period of four andone quarter years, the program for each of sixteen countries and western germany had to be consistent as between its internal program and its export and import programs. for the total of all countries, the requirements from abroad and the availability of supply had to balance. similarly, for the various individual commodities, demand and supply had to balance. for each country, its balance of payments had to be in equilibrium. and when supplies could not be obtained in the united states but could be found in other supplying countries, these prospective sources had to be determined and incorporated into the pattern. in other words, the total pattern had to balance not merely as to an overall figure, but by commodities, by country physical requirements, and by country balances of payments. similar patterns had to be prepared for each year within the period. and finally, the attempt to achieve both commodity and the balance of payments estimates in turn had to be broken down by currency areas in order to indicate the nature of the deficit with the dollar area. the number of arithmetical calculations which have gone into these estimates probably total more than a million. five time periods are covered the last quarter of the present fiscal year, april 1 to june 30, 1948, and the four successive years until june 30, 1952. twenty three areas were involved beginning with the sixteen countries which participated at paris, the dependent areas of the united kingdom, belgium, france, netherlands, portugal, and western germany in three parts the bizonal area, the french zone excluding the saar, and the saar itself (since the saar territory may shortly be incorporated economically into france). twenty six commodity groups were selected for particularly intensive treatment, of which a number such as iron and steel have to be built up from a series of separate categories pig iron, scrap steel, iron ore, crude and semi finished steel, tin plate, steel sheet and other finished steel and for projections of the volume and value of trade covering movements of commodities among the participating countries, between the participating countries and the united states and other western hemisphere and other non participating countries in turn. after the volume of this trade was derived, it had to be multiplied by prices to obtain values. while july 1, 1947 prices were used, it was necessary to ascertain prevailing prices in different areas of the world on that date since the prewar assumption that prices for internationally traded commodities tend to be equal the world over has lost its validity under the conditions which prevail today. the task of combining the figures provided by the commodity committees into a coherent system from which balance of payments estimates could be derived fell, as it happened, to the department of state. an early courageous attempt was made to grapple with it by assembling the adding and calculation machines of which the department can boast only a sparse and scattered population, and by amassing at the same time the clerical assistance necessary to man or ""woman"" the machines. the attempt was futile. the traditions of the department of state and its personnel training are oriented more toward the accurate and careful phrasing of a memorandum than the well multiplied, checked and proven statistical table. resort was necessarily had to punch cards, and automatic sorting and addition. it may be that the foreign office of 10 years hence will boast a full line of international business machines with operators in 24 hour attendance. as of today, it was necessary to work the calculations in on the graveyard shift at census, bureau of labor statistics, and finally in the department of national defense. one further difficulty was to establish the price assumptions to be used for the future period. here the crystal ball was particularly cloudy. the paris conference had used the prices then current, july 1, 1947, as the basis for both exports and imports for the first year (1948) and had then assumed that european export prices would remain firm, while import prices would decline by 7! percent in 1949, 10 percent in 1950, and 12! percent in 1951. the reviewers have felt that the only way out of this dilemma was to present a range. actually, the basic calculations were made in july 1, 1947 prices, but the totals have been adjusted globally to meet different sets of price assumptions. for the first fifteen months, all exports from europe and imports to europe from the western hemisphere except u. s., are calculated at 5 percent above july 1, 1947 prices, while u. s. and non western hemisphere shipments to europe are 7.5 percent above july 1, 1947. in the later years, the calculations on the high price assumption hold the price level constant with the level for the initial period, while the calculations for the low price assumption are based on a marked decline, particularly for the items imported to europe. these different assumptions explain the presence of a range in the total requirement for the program of $15.1 $17.8 billions. the projections are, of course, not blueprints which can be followed during operation. actually, this is a sketch rather than a blueprint. its purpose is to provide congress and the public with as accurate an estimate as possible of what the program may in fact turn out to be, and the general magnitude of the requirements from abroad, if the european recovery program is to be accomplished. if some of the items are not available in the quantities indicated, there may be substitution. if availabilities increase, prices will fall, or if they decrease, prices will rise. in either event, the dollars involved will tend to be more nearly constant than the constituent elements. and with so many commodities and countries, we can fall back on the protection of all statisticians, the hope that the deviations will be somewhat compensatory. in the original undertaking, five sets of questionnaires were drawn up by the european group to obtain information on food, fuels, machinery, iron and steel, transport, and balance of payments. this information has been available to us in washington, and to it has been added further information which we requested, plus the vast reservoir of knowledge accumulated in our government. however, it is unfortunately clear that there are some serious gaps in the basic information required. even with the most complete information possible, there could be no assured results. the most that we can do is to achieve consistent and logical results from as reasonable assumptions as can be made. as i have already pointed out, assumptions had to be made as to price levels. another uncertainty is created by the necessity to estimate crops. should we assume that the weather will continue to be as uncooperative with the farmer in europe as it has been since the end of the war? and there are many other unknowns, such as at what point the processes of commodity hoarding will cease and money will be used again as a store of value. it is clear that the recovery program will have to be a dynamic and flexible operation. as was true during the war, programs will have to be changed from time to time as conditions change, both as to countries and as to commodities. to achieve the most effective use of the available resources, there will need to be continued and detailed statistical recording of progress made, and forecasts of the short and longrun prospects. the injection of statistical methods into foreign policy is therefore no temporary expedient but promises to be a continuing necessity. certain conclusions are now apparent concerning our capacity to reduce the problems which i have been discussing to exact measurement. the first is the common complaint of the statistician that we do not have adequate data. this is, of course particularly true of the countries where the effects of the war are still felt so severely. on the side, we know much too little about the statistical quality and relevance of much of the foreign data. it is clear that these international projects require cooperation and understanding between the statisticians of all participating nations. and time can be used up most rapidly if one is skipping about among long tons, short tons, and metric tons, not to mention bushels, quintals, hundredweights, barrels and imperial gallons. on this point, that of the development of statistical data and the effort to achieve greater uniformity, there is much that the united nations can do, supplemented by the private international statistical organizations. the establishment of a statistical commission by the united nations and the international statistical meetings held in washington last september may give us some encouragement. this is a long time job it calls for continuous support and stimulation. if much is to be accomplished, the statisticians in the united states must take the lead. we must continually be prepared to demonstrate that, in this modern world, many problems can be faced properly and solved economically only when measurement is respected as a fundamental characteristic of the analysis. but beyond these points, there is a continuing frustration because too few relationships have been reduced to calculable form. it is obvious that planning really requires both cost and market data, that the requirements in the form of materials must be readily related to capacity, that labor supply and working capital requirements must all be part of such consideration. here the statistician can make endless contributions, substituting detailed analysis for the rule of thumb or the experimental approach. in these matters, too much is at stake to be careless or casual. nevertheless, our answers often contain far too much of the ""rough estimate"" and too little of the careful calculation. the same problems arise in connection with the use of statistics in the foreign policy field as in any other the struggle to do an honest and objective job, and the difficulties of convincing others that such is the result. there are always those who would prefer to be guided by emotion, prejudice, and preference. it is not at all surprising that suspicions which continually cross national boundaries are not stopped by statistics. nevertheless, the fact remains that problems must be handled; there must be answers; and statisticians, both here and abroad, can contribute much to finding the best answers. as a professional group, we have a clear cut responsibility. first, we must continually strive to improve our performance through developing our own capacities and improving the raw material with which we work. but beyond that, we must persistently try to persuade others to take an objective view of the facts, to use to the full the techniques and capacities which we have to offer. we cannot promise to solve all the world's problems. many of them are not problems of measurement at all. but where possible the utilization of statistics, the reference to objective criteria, and the effort to measure before committing oneself to a line of action these are all ways in which rational men approach problems. and foreign policy should be no exception to the rule. unfortunately, foreign policy is an area where it is all too easy for emotions and prejudices to be aroused, where problems all too often get subjective treatment. one approach towards international understanding is to expose problems to the facts whenever possible and they must be accurate and dependable facts. the battle between prejudice and analysis is our battle, in which we must supply much of the ammunition. our responsibilities and opportunities have greatly increased in the international field. we not only can help in the development of knowledge about the world we live in, but we can actually contribute substantially to that international understanding which is so greatly needed in the world

Snedecor","1940-1969","in undertaking the presidency of the statistical association, my chief purpose was to do my part toward raising the standards of our profession. i soon found it necessary to clarify my ideas about the nature of those standards i hoped to raise. statistics is a sprawling subject covering loosely the collection of observational data, the summarization of these data, the drawing of conclusions based upon them, and pertinent mathematical theory. these processes and theories are the common property of many disciplines. is there any unique feature that distinguishes the professional statistician from his fellows? if so, it should be the foundation on which standards are set up. it is immediately clear that if there is anything that characterizes the professional statistician this thing changes in time. the earliest preoccupation of statisticians was with military and economic affairs of the state human and material resources for making war, and the spoils of a successful campaign. much later came a long period in which statisticians, in the words of r. a. fisher, ""appear to have had no other aim than to ascertain aggregate or average values."" during this period, the theory of probability was extensively developed but its impact on statistical thinking was somewhat superficial. the present era of statistics is characterized by the emphasis on variation, notably sampling variation. variation is interesting not only in itself as a wellnigh universal phenomenon, but more especially as one source of the uncertainty in all inductive reasoning. it seems that in our own time, the professional statistician's peculiar function is to develop and publicize the implications of variation. the future i do not pretend to know; but the consequences of variation,.in the broad sense of uncertain inference do not seem to have been entirely worked out. it is reasonable to believe, then, that both at present and in the foreseeable future, the professional statistician's most useful contribution to science is in the theory and practice of uncertain inference. dr. flood has put it rather strikingly in this fashion: ""the professional statistician reduces data to numerical form and uses them to measure the fallibility of a conclusion where fallibility is estimated exclusively from the data in hand."" the last clause of this definition should be emphasized in advance of further discussion. all scientists make judgments about fallibility. they scrutinize their data with care; conclusions are checked against the theories prevailing in their fields; if there is a reasonable doubt about the conclusion, additional data are collected. it is only after the investigator has satisfied himself, with some high degree of assurance, that his conclusions are valid that he releases them for the critical observation of his colleagues. the distinction between the professional statistician and his fellow scientists is that the statistician evaluates the uncertainty of the conclusion by use of the data themselves, the evaluation being in the form of an exact statement of probability. two other facts should be observed. the first is that scientists are plagued with many variables beside those that can be reduced to measurement by the laws of chance. inaccuracies of various kinds may creep in; it is only lack of precision, ordinarily numeralized in experimental or sampling error, that can (through appropriate conduct of the investigation) be measured. the inaccuracies may invalidate the conclusion despite the fact that the statistical measure of fallibility indicates a high degree of confidence in it. from this, one may decide that the contribution of statistics, in the restrictive sense in which i am using the term, is of minor or even negligible utility. in what follows, i hope to show that such is not the case, at least so far as my experience and observation are evidential. the second 'fact to be observed is that the professional statistician and the investigator in economics, biology, engineering, etc. are usually the same person. it is merely for convenience that i mention them separately. researchers in many fields have seized upon the statistical devices for measuring uncertainty, so that i include them in my definition of professional statistician. my thesis is that the characteristic which distinguishes the present day professional statistician is his interest and skill in the measurement of the fallibility of conclusions. the layman, i am sure, would be surprised by such a statement. he is accustomed to the trappings of statistics rather than to the essence of it. to him statistics is symbolized by long rows of tedious figures and their display in tables and charts. even job specifications for statisticians are commonly limited to the arithmetical processes of calculating averages, correlation coefficients, trends and probable errors. these are all useful procedures but they can be carried on as well by a clerk as by the professional often, indeed, better. the professional statistician, whatever his other necessary qualifications, would seem to be set off from the layman by his habitual awareness of the fallibility of conclusions based upon data. it is not my purpose to advance further arguments for the thesis that statistics has this unique function, but merely to assume that it has and to discuss some of the consequences. first, let us look at the field of experimental science. in the familiar sequence of the scientific method hypothesis, experiment, conclusion the part which is peculiarly statistical is the conclusion. this involves a judgment about the fallibility of that"" .. logically hazardous process the process of generalizing from particular results."" i am quoting from mood's introduction of his ""theory of statistics."" ""the broad problem of statistical inference is to provide measures of the uncertainty of conclusions drawn from experimental data."" one highly developed measure of uncertainty is the statistical test of. hypothesis; this exemplifies the statistical part of the scientific method. were the professional statistician to take no further interest in the procedures of the scientific method he would be fulfilling his essential share in them by evaluating fallibility, but he would fall far short of realizing his full usefulness to his fellow scientists. it is not until late in the sequence that the statistical part of the method finds its place. at this stage it is often discovered that faults in the design of the experiment make the measurement of fallibility either unnecessarily difficult or wholly impossible; it is not unusual to find too late that the quantity of data furnished by the experiment is inadequate to detect the effects in question; and it may be evident that the experiment by change of design could have been made more sensitive, with consequent saving of effort and money. this means that the professional statistician may not only facilitate his own job at the end but may increase the efficiency of the experiment by modifying its design and may, indeed, rescue it from failure by estimating its required size; all this by anticipating his own peculiar part in the conclusion. to me it is astonishing as well as gratifying that the professional statistician, in order to perform effectively his small but indispensable part in the scientific method, has been impelled to inspect the whole structure and has brought about substantial strengthening in many of its members. turning next to the field of science in which the survey instead of the experiment is the device used, we find statistics occupying somewhat the same unique position. the objective of the survey may be either to get information about some hypothesis or to estimate one or more parameters of the population. a survey is planned and executed in order to get the necessary evidence. the conclusion, in so far as it is based on the data, is inductive in nature and is subject to uncertainty. it may be looked upon as the professional statistician's particular business to evaluate this uncertainty. as in experimental science, the professional statistician can enhance his usefulness by helping with the design of the survey. he can recommend designs that will furnish appropriate estimates of both position and scale; he can help choose the design that will be as efficient as is profitable; and he can specify the size of the sample that, with a designated probability, may be expected to yield a satisfactorily small measure of the fallibility of the conclusion regardless of what this conclusion may turn out to be. but in this branch of science, the professional statistician is called upon to make more extensive contributions than those required in experimentation. not only must he concern himself with precision but more especially with conditions affecting accuracy. so far as i can judge, the majority of the surveys now in operation have sources of inaccuracy not amenable to measurement by means of the data obtained. restriction of the sampling to regions non randomly chosen and the purposive selection of respondents are inherent causes of inaccuracy in the usual type of quota sampling. these causes easily could be remedied. but the professional statistician cannot stop when the relatively simple procedures of sampling are improved. he will then have to join other scientists in their attack on the really tough problems of schedule construction, selection and training of interviewers, and the little understood relations between interviewer and respondent. although these problems are psychologic, social and economic, they affect the probabilities which control the measurement of uncertainty and therefore fall within the purview of the professional statistician's interest. why do professional statisticians in surveys have graver responsibilities than those in the experimental sciences? one reason is that the experiment is an older and better developed instrument than the survey, requiring less extensive and less obvious improvements. another is that in the main experimenters are better trained for their work than are surveyors, and are heirs to a tradition of severe self discipline. operators of surveys are only beginning to feel the need for examining their procedures: the embarrassment of the pollers in the recent election will, i hope, emphasize the necessity for higher standards among all samplers. if not, increasing loss of confidence by the public is sure to ensue. a third reason for the heavier responsibilities of professional statisticians in surveys is that controls are more difficult for investigators who work with human material homo sapiens is notoriously a difficult experimental animal. it may be years or even decades before the professional statistician's part in the survey becomes so specialized as it now is in the experiment. reverting next to my opening theme, it seems obvious to me that in assessing professional standing in statistics, expertness in evaluating the fallibility of conclusions should playa major role. in saying this, i am not ignoring the fact that most users of statistics will have little interest in qualifying as specialists in so narrow a branch of the subject. statisticians (who mayor may not rate as professionals) have astonishingly varied activities. the collection of data, the planning that precedes this collection, the summarizing processes that follow, the interpretation and reporting of the resultsthese are preoccupations of thousands of us. other thousands, doubtless the majority, have only an incidental interest in professional statistics, their primary objectives being in the field of application economics, industry, medicine, and dozens more: these usually are included in the fold of statistics because, in their own subject matter fields, they base their investigations on observational data. but all who use statistics have this in common: they are working toward conclusions based on more or less incomplete enumeration, conclusions that have the uncertainty of all induction. so, they are all concerned with the evaluation of uncertainty whether or not they specialize in this unique feature. i believe that every statistician will be more valuable in his own area if he clearly apprehends this universal characteristic of his material and that his professional competence will increase with his expertness in evaluating the fallibility of conclusions based upon such material. it is plain that i make a clear distinction between professional statisticians and statisticians in fields using statistics as a tool, statisticians who may have no proficiency in measuring uncertainty. these latter must of necessity make judgments about risk, but they often do this successfully without actual evaluation. they may be top flight scientists or administrators but may never subject their probabilities explicitly to measurement. it is the measurement of the uncertainties of conclusions that distinguishes the professional statistician and which makes him useful to other professionals in the various fields of application. professional statisticians mayor may not be mathematicians. the more mathematics the better, but it is not essential. of course, the mathematical statistician must develop the techniques of measurement and must carefully describe the conditions of their applicability. if unusual conditions are met, he must be called upon to devise appropriate new techniques. the non mathematical professional statistician must gain experience in the subject matter fields. he cannot assuredly evaluate the uncertainty of conclusions unless he is intimately acquainted with the uncertainties in the data which he uses for his measurements. to some, on first thought, it may appear that i am suggesting unnecessarily rigorous standards. after more careful consideration they will agree, i think that this is not so. there is nothing essentially difficult in the idea of variation and its consequences; i have found that students in a first course in statistics easily grasp the concepts. the idea is certainly not new though it has received increasing emphasis during the last thirty or forty years. actually i ammaking the modest suggestion that professional attainment in statistics be gauged by attitudes toward statistical thinking of the present rather than of the past. it seems to me that up to dateness is a minimum standard for professionalism in any field. in my thinking, standards in professional statistics must be based, at least in part, on modern developments in the subject; they must include not only proficiency but preoccupation in the measurement of uncertainty. let us now consider the application of my thesis to education. fundamentally i am a teacher. i think my chief contribution to statistics is the training of hundreds of budding scientists in the straight and narrow way of uncertain inference. until recently my field has been a narrow one, limited almost entirely to the statistics of biological experimentation. only during the last year have i begun the development of a course in elementary statistics with broad cultural objectives. this field seemingly is without limits. the unique feature of statistics, the evaluation of risk, is part of the daily and hourly living of every one of us. uncertainty envelops us, and success or failure in life is the summation of myriads of decisions as to which is the least hazardous course. it would seem that one or more courses in statistics would be part of every student's training: but, as dr. walker said in her presidential address of 1944, ""i have never heard of a liberal arts college that undertook to explain to its students the stochastic nature of the universe in which they live and move and have their being."" why is this? i fear it is because we, as teachers, have failed to make the subject vital and convincing. i am afraid we have emphasized the calculational and graphical devices rather than the essential nature of the subject. instead of devoting our energies to bringing the student into harmony with his physical, biological and economic environment of variation and uncertainty, we have bored him with another course in arithmetic and algebra from which meaning is largely omitted. the nature of decisions based on probability, experience in sampling together with the concomitant risk in drawing conclusions, the fundamentals of our great cooperation in insurance, the social implications of betting these are a few of the numerous facts of life that should form the structure of our courses in statistics. i believe that if, during the past fifty years, a realistic, living statistics had been taught, the subject would now be considered indispensable by most of our college administrators. i think it an auspicious sign that a section on business statistics is being considered during this annual meeting. business and statistics are blood brothers in that risk is basic in both. yet most of our instruction in business statistics either ignores this common heritage or touches upon it vaguely in a chapter on sampling tucked away in the latter part of the book. about the only risk the student seems to be made conscious of is the risk of a mistake in arithmetic. is it too much to hope that some of our forward looking business executives take the initiative in advocating the elimination of unrealistic courses in statistics from our curricula and the substitution of functional courses in their stead? i judge this could be done in half a dozen years by an energetic organization with adequate resources. after all, business is a consumer of the college product and is in a commanding position to insist on quality control of the output. the lack of professional standards for teachers of statistics in our colleges and universities is an astonishing feature of our times. in fields other than statistics, even an instructor is often required to have the doctor's degree in the subject matter of the department; the bachelor's degree in an almost universal minimum requirement. yet how many teachers of statistics have been graduated from a curriculum in statistics? it apparently never occurs to the head of a department of education, for example, to ask a prospective teacher of statistics about his degrees in statistics. most of us are graduates of such departments as economics, mathematics, business or psychology. our academic training in statistics may have been no more extensive than the courses we now teach. personally, we are not to blame for this because in our generations there were no curricula in statistics. even at present they are distressingly few. but weas teachers should be aggressively dissatisfied with such a condition. we should work for the establishment of departments of statistics and should each strive to improve his own professional standing. we should resolve that the next generation of teachers shall have advantages not available to us. our section on the training of statisticians has the glorious opportunity of leading in this high endeavor. what are the implications of my thesis for the statistical association? under our new constitution we have abandoned our preoccupation with anyone subject matter field and have volunteered our services as a focus of statistics among them all. in this capacity, we were asked to participate in the work of the hoover commission, suggesting desirable reorganization in the statistical agencies of the government. we are joining the social science research council in reviewing the recent election predictions of three of the most prominent polling organizations. two government bureaus have asked criticism and suggestions for their programs. in meeting such responsibilities, our commission on statistical standards and organizations seems destined to wield a powerful influence in statistical affairs. these things can be done only because we have in our membership professional statisticians of the highest competence. to maintain and enlarge this leadership, we must attract to our ranks other able statisticians from all subjectmatter fields, professional statisticians whose skills include that unique function of modern statistics, the measurement of the uncertainty of inductive

Kuznets","1940-1969","statistical data may be defined as numerical observations of aggregates; statistical theory as a body of tools for use in collecting and analyzing such observations. provided we include all aggregates subject to uncontrolled change, these definitions should be broad enough to encompass all the activities of statisticians. the role of statistical data and tools in the study of society can hardly be overestimated. social aggregates are seldom subject to experiment, i.e., to the ""imposition of deliberate change with the intention of studying its effects."" the extraordinary power of this technique, which permits the analyst to dispense with an unwieldy mass of raw data and put in its place a few observations made in a controlled experimental situation, is not often at the disposal of the student of society. perhaps if this student belonged to some nonhuman species, could manipulate the human race, and were interested in a few outward, observable aspects of human society, statistical data would prove of small moment to him. but we are members or kins of members of the society we study; the very directions of analysis are determined by our interests as members; and our power of experimenting with social aggregates is exceedingly limited. under such conditions, statistical observations are perhaps the only type of record that combines, if precautions are taken, freedom from human bias with the numerical form that permits a thoroughness of analysis otherwise impossible. an aggregate is a collective the several parts of which are distinguishable, and can be treated as homogeneous and independent of the collective under which it is classified. the measure of a single item is not statistics unless the item is viewed as part of an aggregate. a collective entity whose parts are completely interdependent and interdetermined is not an aggregate. the statement that controlled experiment is not feasible in the study of social aggregates has become so trite that it is accepted without full appreciation of its ramified implications. these implications are the main subject of this discussion, and my purpose in dwelling on them is to see what guidance they offer in developing a statistical discipline for the study of society. we discuss the conditions that govern the statistical study of society under four heads: the supply of data; their reliability; the structure of the universe recorded by them; pressure for and obstacles to analysis. ii the supply of statistics relating to society is affected in only small degree by the interests and views of the scholar. in areas where controlled experiment is possible, the experimenter produces his own data in accordance with his analytical goals. data on social aggregates are produced by society at large, and only society itself, through its various agencies, is in a position to collect the records."" whether these are gathered in a deliberate search for information as in our censuses or as a byproduct of administrative activity; whether the social aggregate operates through the sovereign and authoritative organs of the state or through semi voluntary bodies (trade associations, trade unions, professional societies, etc.) the production of the data is a social, not an individual, act. this social act origin of data on social aggregates greatly affects their coverage. the decision to collect data for their broad, informational value is governed by the importance of the information for the general operation of society, weighed against the costs and difficulties of getting it costs in both dollars and social resistance to be encountered, and difficulties in terms of whether the respondents have the information at hand as a result of day to day activity. when the data are collected as a byproduct of administration, their supply depends first, upon the decision of society to regulate or administer some activity; secondly, upon the balance between the prospective returns and the cost of getting and making the data available. finally, for a wide variety of statistics collected by private and semi public agencies the determining factors are the market demand and the willingness of respondents to share the information both factors reflecting the need for the statistics on the part of potential users. • social aggregates are not easily observable by an individual, unless he happens to be in command and can order the collection of data. contrast the ease with which an individual can observe many natural phenomena, e.g., the rising and setting of the sun. it is perhaps this ease that led to a much earlier accumulation of empirical, dot necessarily experimental, data on natural phenomena. the kind of records individuals accumulated about society ill the early days was often worse than none. the supply of statistics on social aggregates is thus determined by needs, administrative emphasis, and costs all as viewed by the various agencies of society which, at any given time, have the power to decide what is important. the views of these agencies necessarily differ from those that would be entertained by a scientifically minded analyst, even one who happened to live at the same time and in the same place. consequently, the supply of data is capricious as judged by any consistent and reasoned standard for scientific analysis. examples are abundant in every field of social study: in economics, with which i am most familiar, one can find them easily by leafing through the recent, valuable publication of the census bureau, historical statistics of the united states. as we all know, data on the foreign trade of this country are plentiful, and run back to the founding of the republic; whereas data on domestic production of many major commodities have been scanty until recent decades, and on volume of domestic trade almost completely absent until the 1930's. we have long series on revenues and expenditures of the federal government, but as yet no reliable continuous information on the revenues and expenditures of the individuals and households that make up the nation. it would not be difficult to explain why the long series have been collected, even including such an esoteric item as the mackerel catch on the atlantic coastj! or why data on some other, more important aspects of our economic activity are missing. but understanding the situation is cold comfort when we are confronted with the difficulties of analyzing many major facets of society. a significant, if obvious, aspect of the situation is that the views of society and its agencies about the importance of a social process and the difficulties of measuring it change from time to time and place to place. in countries where the industrial and money system have spread most widely it has become easier in recent decades to measure many economic and social phenomena: life has grown more accountable quantitatively, and technical improvements have rendered data collection and tabulation less costly. also, the attention paid by society to various social and economic problems has increased, powering a drive for more statistical data. in consequence, the supply of statistics in the industrialized countries has grown apace in recent decades, and is today much richer for these areas than for less industrialized countries.! 4 see series f 164, p. 128. • recent developments in sampling theory and practice have not only reduced materially the costs of data collection but also made it feasible where formerly it was impossible; and served to yield assignable limits to at least some of the errors in them. this promises well for the future. the past, on which the scholar depends. is scarcely retrievable by these methods. all this is to the good. but we must not overlook the fact that statistical analysis of social phenomena requires data for periods marked by a variety of changes over time, and for social systems marked by a diversity of social organization. without this variety, the analyst cannot distinguish the components of change and test the stability of patterns and relations. there is a, fundamental conflict between the selectivity in the supply of statistical data on social aggregatesselectivity that confines the data largely to certain types of society and certain historical phases in their development and the variety of coverage required by the essential purpose of statistical analysis: to establish variable and constant elements in the complex of change. iii the social ongm, uncontrolled experimentally, of social statistics obviously affects their reliability. a sketch of the sources of possible error may be useful in indicating one of the major tasks of a statistician concerned with the study of society. errors may arise from lack of control, first, by the respondent; second, by the collecting agency; and, third, by the analytically minded final user. almost all primary statistics oll social aggregates are derived by some composition, if not necessarily straight addition, of reports by individuals, responding either as individuals or as representatives of some enterprise unit. the respondents are usually numerous, and errors in their reports may easily arise either because they deliberately falsify or because their knowledge is not full or accurate. in either event, the errors may be correlated with the true values of the characteristics. certainly, deliberate errors of response caused by anticipation of consequences pleasant or unpleasant are likely to be systematically associated with the true magnitudes. involuntary errors may reflect a lack of knowledge that is itself a social characteristic connected with the phenomenon that is recorded. the patterns and directions of this association between errors and the true magnitudes vary from group to group, time to time, and place to place. it is, therefore, not easy to deal with them by a broad and standard scheme: specific knowledge of the character of bias or of ignorance is required. the problem is avoided or minimized in controlled situations where the experimenter himself makes the observations. but even were all units to respond candidly and accurately, errors might still arise in the primary data, as compiled and made available by the collecting agencies. they might be committed first in the attempt at a complete count or estimate. even complete enumerations rarely cover all units that should be included; and in designedly incomplete surveys, the transition from presumably correct responses by the sample to the comprehensive totals is seldom free from serious pitfalls. second, units must be grouped into broader categories; and the choices and decisions involved in this step may be unavoidably arbitrary. consider, as an illustration, the problem of classifying corporations by their industrial affiliation a basic set of data in the economic statistics of this country. with the most accurate and detailed reporting of products, difficulties would arise in placing multiproduct corporations in one or another industry; and the grouping of the responding units in the industrial categories involves arbitrary elements and hence consciously committed errors on the part of the compiling agencies. in the experimentally controlled situation, on the contrary, the selected and limited body of data may not require grouping into categories; or can easily be allocated to those devised with special relevance to their unequivocal fitness. both phases in the flow of primary data to the analytically minded user are largely irreversible. errors in reporting can be detected post facto but their adjustment is at best tentative. errors by the collecting and publishing agency in passing from incomplete coverage to complete estimates or in grouping units can also be probed for yet the individual analyst can seldom make a complete adjustment or reclassification. even were we to assume accuracy on the part of both respondents and collecting agencies in terms of the definitions and classifications the collecting agency employs the results might still reflect lack of control from the standpoint of the analyst since the concepts and classifications he would like to use, in the light of his theoretical model of the universe, may differ significantly from those of the collecting agency. this cleavage between the collector and the analyst is avoided or minimized in a controlled experiment where the analyst sets the conditions for data collection even if he himself is not the collector. statistics on social aggregates must necessarily follow current institutional concepts and patterns. the very facts that the main motive for their collection is their use in connection with the social problems of the day and that the ultimate source of information is the individual respondent, mean that concepts and classifications are bound to reflect institutional reality. unless they do, the respondents will be unable to supply the information, short of an improbable endowment with the tools and techniques of the scientific analyst; and the collecting agencies will be unable to combine and group the results so as to provide links to the existing institutions the only possible loci of public policy. but these institutional concepts and classifications may differ from those used as tools by the analyst. to illustrate: what business enterprises recognize and report as profits may well differ from what economic theory defines as profits; what society recognizes as capital or assets may differ significantly from the economist's definition. i do not mean to imply that the world of the analyst and the real world are completely apart; they must be and are closely related. nor do i mean to suggest that it is impossible to obtain information reflecting somewhat more sharply defined concepts and classifications than exist in crude reality. but the :real and familiar cannot be stretched at will into more consistent intellectual categories; and the close relation between the world of the mind and the world of reality does not preclude significant differences, where the sharply etched concepts and classifications of analysis cannot find any exact counterpart in statistics, given their origin and the necessary adherence to institutional patterns. it is in this sense that, even if complete control is assumed by respondents and collecting agencies, the resulting statistics will have a fuzziness from the viewpoint of the analyst that implies lack of complete reliability."" iv we turn now to the basic question of statistical theory in connection with the study of society the nature of changes in observations of social aggregates. the first relevant statement is obvious: since experimental controls are not present, any item of statistical evidence concerning society is an historical series. this is undeniably true of any chronological array of successive observations. but even a frequency distribution, a cross section measured at a point in time, must be viewed as a unit in a time series, and the components of the crosssection may well be subject to different patterns of change over time and their given magnitudes reflect different phases in these patterns of temporal change. this observation is a truism. but its implications are so far reaching that they are worth exploring, even at the risk of stressing the obvious. the foremost is the difficulty of deriving satisfactory hypotheses that are susceptible of test. the statistical investigator of social aggregates attempts to construct models of systematic change over time embodying • this statement should not, of course, preclude the possibility of bridging the gap not only by better analysis of empirical data but also by reformulation of concepts which, as they stand, may not have any empirical counterpart whatever. conditions of statistical research 7 whatever knowledge he has of the quantitative effects of factors that produce the changes. not in a position to isolate these factors by experiment, he has to devise hypotheses grounded, as far as possible, on comparisons of historical situations, comparisons that permit him to distinguish within the variety of conditioning circumstances systematic patterns that can be associated with different groups of factors in operation. resolution of time series into components, distinguished by their patterns of change; synthesis of partial time series into broader units to remove some elements of variability characterizing the parts but not the whole; association of distinct time series to see whether the patterns in each have some systematic relation with one another all these devices have one common aim: to establish the significant patterns of systematic change, to elaborate models of both the patterns and the variability that can be associated with them. the ultimate hope is to trace these patterns and associations to factors that can be distinguished and observed as independent variables, and to establish their persistence over time and the possible effect of policy on them. the difficulties of deriving such hypotheses, building such explanatory models, in a study of social aggregates are all too obvious; they reside in the complexity and changeability of social phenomena and in the limitations of the supply of data already discussed. yet they must be solved before we can take advantage of the tools given us by current statistical theory for testing hypotheses. the theories of variance and sampling with which we are familiar are essentially grounded in situations where controls are sufficient to eliminate the effects of the major, systematic bias factors, if not to produce complete stability. this statement is true whether we think of the classical theory or of modern developments in connection with small samples; whether we accept the maximum likelihood or the confidence intervals approach; whether we think of the realistic counterpart of sampling theory in physics, biology, agronomy, or quality control. 7 this means that as long as we recognize systematic, if you wish, autocorrelated, patterns of temporal change in historical series, and recognize them as quantitatively dominating, we cannot accept, until hypotheses of systematic changes have been thoroughly worked out, assumptions concerning vari 7 it is of interest that the developments in sampling theory in recent decades were associated with the emergence of experimental techniques in new fields, which called for a reconsideration of theory for the purpose of dealing with the new situations. the association between the developments in biology and agronomy and r. a. fisher's work, between the emergence of mass production of standardized units and quality control methods, and between the pressure of war needs and the emergence of sequential analysis, are all cases in point. these are all experimental and quasi experimental situations, in a different class from the situations described by historical time series. underlie the current theory of frequency distributions and sampling, assumptions that imply sufficient control to eliminate systematic major factors. these assumptions may be used toward the end of an analysis of time series, not at the beginning; just as the statistical theory of normal and near normal variance is used at the end of the controlled experiment, not at its beginning. the construction of hypotheses concerning systematic change in historical time series may properly be viewed as the task of the economist, sociologist, etc., rather than of the statistical theorist. but whoever uses statistical data in the search for intellectual order must recognize the proper relation between the construction of hypotheses and the application of tests now available in statistical theory; must, above all, recognize the gap between the structure of historical time series and post controlled experiment situations underlying statistical theory. he must resist the temptation to identify prematurely calendar time, as it is used in time series; viz., as a means of marking dates for possible use in associating a given phenomenon with others preceding, contemporary, or succeeding; with experimental time; viz., time that is counted in seconds, hours, etc., elapsed since a change was deliberately introduced to bring about an expected effect. he must resist the temptation to apply prematurely to historical series the elegant apparatus developed for an entirely different situation; and to proceed by modifying theory merely to make a general allowance for departure from what might be called post controlled experiment variance. for it is not the general magnitude of the departures from this essentially different model that is important or fruitful; the crux is in the positive identification of the systematic elements in the situation, and the need is for a study of their specific attributes. v to complete the picture, attention should be paid to the pressures that play upon the statistical analyst of social aggregates. these are intangible, not easily describable in unequivocal terms. their importance, however, warrants discussion, even at the danger of miscalculating their true weights. we discuss these pressures briefly under three heads: economic, moral, and intellectual. by economic pressures we mean the ways in which allocation of resources by society shapes the statistical analysis of social problems. thorough use of statistics is laborious and costly, and can scarcely be undertaken as a hobby. but in modern society conditions of gainful employment that permit statistical research are generally geared to current problems. consider the situation in this country, where statistical study of society is perhaps further advanced than elsewhere. a large proportion of statisticians concerned with social aggregates are in the employ of governmental agencies. their natural preoccupation with current problems, especially governmental policy, militates against gaining a long time perspective, a world wide horizon, and leisure for well founded conclusions. another large group are connected with private and semi public enterprises. their attention too is naturally channeled into current problems, especially those of group or private interests. a much smaller group are attached to research institutions that are public but not governmental. even here there is compulsion to deal with problems that are in the public interest, since the economic position of these institutions depends upon current public judgment of their usefulness. finally, at the universities, which should be the sponsors of basic research, there is no tradition of such sponsorship (as distinct from teaching) in the social sciences and too much dependence upon outside financing which again brings economic pressure for concentration upon current problems and for 'results.' i do not mean that economic pressures are so monolithic that no opportunity exists for long range, multi geared research, in which the investigator is allowed to build his conclusions slowly, on sound bases. but economic pressures favor research upon current problems, within a narrow space time framework, and with a tendency toward a rapid formulation of ready and presumably useful conclusions. even were there no economic pressures, research workers would be under moral pressure to concentrate upon current problems and to draw conclusions for use in policy making. it is as difficult for a social scientist to be indifferent to the interests of his subject, human society, as it is easy for an entomologist to disregard the interests of his ants or for the physicist to be blissfully oblivious to the hopes and aspirations of the atoms he bombards. and even if some students of society are able to deal with the longer range issues and eschew the problems of the country and of the day, their proportion is small because the social sciences are bound to attract minds with a lively interest in current problems. the intellectual pressures are somewhat more subtle but perhaps stronger because they bear directly upon analysis concerned with the basic purpose of scientific study to establish valid generalizations. these pressures follow two channels. the first is a consequence of the incurable urge of the human mind to seek system in the complex mutations of observable reality, to impose order on chaos. it is not easy to resist this urge by dwelling upon the scarcity and unreliability of observations or the short span of experience they cover. even if not concerned with practical uses of results or with the problems of the day, the scholar will still be inevitably concerned with the relevance of his observations to some consistent and broad framework of knowledge, to some system with a validity broader than the raw empirical data themselves possess. it is, therefore, understandable that limitations of data do not prevent attempts at theorizing and that this form of intellectual pressure produces a spate of theories, models, and generalizations whose claims to validity go far beyond their empirical bases. how else explain the variety of hypotheses and conjectures in economics, viewed dispassionately and appraised against the empirical data used by their authors? the main factor is the inveterate urge of the human mind to generalize. the other channel of pressure operates even when one resists the temptation to establish intellectual order with inadequate data. if further development of empirical study, further additions to our stock of reliable and meaningful data, depend upon how we use the already available information; if in the cumulative process of growth of a science failure to analyze existing data may mean perpetuation of errors or scarcity of supply in the future, a strong motive exists for squeezing the last ounce of meaning out of the information at hand. no matter how careful and circumspect one may be in such an attempt, there is pressure in the direction of stretching data that may not be adequate to cover wider issues. one must not overlook the tremendous value of these intellectual urges and temptations for advance in our knowledge has largely been powered by them. and it is equally easy to recognize that all scientific models and hypotheses must transcend the limits of the data that underlie them, must extend claims to the unknown. but many of such theory or hypothesis building attempts have fallen short of using the data that were already available at the time; and, most important, few have been tested by information other than that used in their derivation, or have ever been presented in a form in which effective tests could be made by others. in point of fact, the description of the empirical frame of reference of many hypotheses, generalizations, inferences, etc., in the study of society even those claiming statistical foundation is loose and ambiguous. consequently, statisticians concerned with the study of society are confronted with another major task the critical evaluation of the validity of hypotheses and theories claiming some degree of generality. it would obviously be impossible and sinfully wasteful to disregard these products of the human mind completely, but it is equally difficult to accept them at face value. the student of social aggregates thus works in a field cluttered up with the debris of intellectual endeavor, and to salvage a modicum of what is useful is far from easy. one hardly need labor the point that evolving efficient tests and devices for assigning limits of inference to a given body of quantitative evidence is a major and customary task for the discipline of statistics. the above sketch of the conditions of statistical study of society, although oversimplified, is realistic enough to permit conclusions concerning the directions of work in the statistical discipline in the field. it is for the sake of these conclusions that we have treated the wide field so superficially. their general tenor must have already become clear from the emphasis in our earlier remarks. the discussion of the supply of statistical data suggests an urgent need to plan the supply for the future and to recover data that lie in obscurity owing to disuse. extension of his interest and vision to encompass a longer period and a wider area, and to penetrate more deeply through attention to smaller time and space units, is the sale way a statistician can enrich the effective supply of data. for it is only his work that will breathe life into the dead and dusty volumes of whatever statistics are available; force the attention of other students to the relevance of these data to effective knowledge; and provide the basis for a more systematic and rounded collection in the future. in stressing the social act origin of statistical data on society, i certainly do not mean to imply that the supply cannot be influenced by individual workers. but the influence cannot be effective unless the horizons of statistical research, of the work of the statistical scholars themselves are broadened. such an extension is possible with the data at hand. we need not wait for further accretions of data. my impression is that research is lagging behind the accumulation of data; that there is still a wide area in which, despite difficulties, fruitful work need not be estopped by lack of information; and that, accordingly, large potentialities of enriching the supply of data for the future lie in extending time and space boundaries and in refining units in research with data already available. considerations of the reliability of the data suggest an even more obvious and specific task. we need most a more explicit description of how the data are or were obtained and a more specific appraisal of the possible errors involved. as a user, rather than collector, i have been increasingly impressed in recent years with the difficulty of getting accurate information on the origin of various time series and of attaching magnitudes to the errors that characterize them. indeed, as a rule, collectors and publishers of primary data do not deem it their obligation to accompany a series by a detailed description of how it was obtained; and users also, for the most part, tend to accept a series, particularly one issued by a governmental agency, at its face value without inquiring into its reliability. if this impression is correct, there is surely room for much additional work. it may legitimately be urged that compilers and publishers of series give full details on methods of collection, compilation, classification, and adjustment; that various compendia of basic series supply descriptions of their origin as an indispensable part of the information; that users exercise their right to be informed about the derivation of the series offered them; and that authors of textbooks on statistics become cognizant of the problem and cease confining their attention to tools of analysis while forgetting the elementary question of the character of the primary and derived data. ail this opens a wide and still relatively uncultivated field. the problems of theory suggested by our discussion of the nature of changes in social statistics are, despite strenuous efforts, still rather intractable. it is clear that one must seriously question a great variety of statistical analyses that consciously or unconsciously are based upon too easy an assumption of post experimental types of variance. also, as already suggested, attempts to treat the cardinal difference between historical series and experimental types of variance by autocorrelation adjustment devices, variate difference methods, conversion to ranks, etc., are highly suspect, for the very reason that they drown the little specific knowledge we have of patterns of change in historical series in the anonymity of formal deviations from normal or near normal variance. but even if this judgment is accepted, and i realize that many of our members will dissent, it cannot be claimed that we have effective models. we are still groping toward an adequate theory of historical series; a theory that may well differ from one substantive area to another. in such a situation we can only urge more analytical and empirical work; more serious attention by handlers of mathematical tools to the specific conditions of the model building task; and more interchange of knowledge among the many substantive fields, not only in the social sciences, in which the use of uncontrolled historical series is prevalent. one can hardly be dogmatic here, but a great deal is still to be done. we must extend the area of work that avoids the dangers of, on the one hand, limitations of elaborate mathematical models that rest upon oversimplified assumptions and, on the other, the intuitive type of approach whose results are not subject to check and do not cumulate into a system of tested knowledge. this continued search for a positive theory of analysis of historical series should encourage rather than preclude more attention to the fourth major task: a critical appraisal of theories, generalizations, inferences. an obvious step in this direction has been suggested: an author's obligation to state the space time limits of validity he claims for his generalization. it is not uncommon to find statistical studies in which the consumption, or savings, or other 'function' is established with an indication of the series used for the purpose, yet with vague claims of a more general validity for the function and no specification of the space time limits of these claims. obviously more explicitness in stating the limits of validity would be a major step forward partly toward facilitating testing of the results, and even more toward preventing generalizations from too inadequate samples. it is a simple step, yet not easy; but then there is no inherent connection in intellectual performance between simplicity and ease. and beyond such a step, there is no need to urge the value of vigorous criticism of the output of statistical analysis, more vigorous than in the past: little progress can be expected in a field such as we are dealing with unless we cull out untenable results. vii two comments are added. to place the discussion in a somewhat broader framework. first, while we have considered statistical research in the study of human society, many of the questions and suggestions apply to other fields in which uncontrolled historical series have to be used. unfamiliarity with these other fields prevents me from urging this point strongly. but problems connected with the supply and reliability of data and with the nature of the universe reflected in them in fields such as forestry, botany, zoology, biology, geology, meteorology, and even astronomy, seem to me not unlike those in the statistical study of human society. naturally, the parallelism is far from exact. there should, however, be wide possibility of learning from other disciplines, not only as among the various fields of social study, but also as among all students of human society, on the one hand, and in historically bound natural science disciplines, on the other. second, is the subject under discussion really statistics or is it largely the substantive disciplines concerned with the study of society? it may be argued that what i have discussed is not statistics, if by the latter is meant the theory and practice of analyzing records of variance of a restricted type; that i have been dealing really with economics, sociology, etc., albeit of a quantitative type. my reaction would be to avoid a debate on semantics, even though statistics long meant a quantitative study of society, as the etymology of the very name reveals."" what we call it does not matter; and if clarity may be attained thereby, let us christen the intellectual discipline i have been discussing with a new name say, historical arithmetic, on the pattern of political arithmetic, one of its ancestors. so long as we understand by historical arithmetic the study and analysis that deals with quantitative records of historically bound processes, for the eventual purpose of establishing testable generalizations; so long as we agree that the intellectual problems arising in such an effort are common to a wide variety of substantive fields of study, we shall be dealing with a body of methods of divers application and a common core that justifies considering it a major field of scientific methodology. however such semantic questions are answered, it seems clear that in this field of scientific methodology, our association, its present membership and those who will join our ranks in years to come, have an important task to perform. under the shock of the catastrophic events of recent decades, belief in the possibility and usefulness of scientific study of human society has grown perceptibly weaker. there are, and will be, many to doubt that the search for objectively found patterns of stability and change is likely to yield significant knowledge in the field; and who will turn to other ways in which men may reconcile themselves to the apparently capricious turbulence of human history. we can easily understand and sympathize with such doubts. but it is difficult for me to see how there can be any guide for scientific work and development other than a belief in the existence of some order in the seemingly chaotic jumble of history; in the demonstrability of such order in empirical terms; and in the ultimate social usefulness of the resulting body of tested theory. these three basic beliefs warrant examination of conditions of statistical research, such as has been sketched above, in the spirit of setting a task for the future rather than of apology for the past and for failure to go on; in terms of hope rather than of despair.

Wilks","1940-1969","serious long range problems confronting the world of statistics is that of establishing a sound pattern of statistical education for college undergraduates. the uses of statistics and statistical methods have become so widespread throughout business, industry, government, and scientific research in recent years that this matter concerns not only the professional statisticians themselves, but many thousands of persons in these fields who are finding it necessary to become intelligent consumers of statistics and statistical methods. our present difficulties are deep rooted, but in the time which association tradition has assigned me for a retiring presidential address, i wish to discuss some of the major aspects of this situation and to propose some steps for dealing with it. advanced statistical training well under way i shall not be concerned with specialized graduate training in statistics. it was a critical problem until fairly recently, but it is now being gradually solved, thanks to the emergence of a few strong centers for advanced training in applied and theoretical statistics and to the entry of increasing numbers of able students into these fields. the sustained influence of the various research journals in applied and theoretical statistics over a period of years, and the effect of discussion of the teaching of advanced statistics during the last ten years under the leadership of committees of the institute of mathematical statistics, the national research council, the royal statistical society, and the inter statistical institute, have been important factors in the establishment of these centers. advanced training is now well under way and will steadily improve. it is carried on not only in university centers but in certain government agencies and laboratories. we already have a substantial flow of excellent books from the publishers for students at the advanced level and this will have a telling effect in a few years. so let us proceed to the problem of undergraduate statistical education. growth of statistics and present training any person who will retrace the path by which statistics has reached the position it now occupies in government, business, industry, and scientific research will be deeply impressed by the acceleration with which this development has occurred and by the extent to which it now penetrates most compartments of these broad fields. he will be shocked but not surprised by the topsy like educational structure which has grown up in response to the training needs of this movement. the great acceleration is highlighted by such facts as these: the membership of this association has grown from 1700 (in 1935) to 4500; the society for quality control, founded in 1945, now has over 3500 members; the two year old biometric society now has over 900 members; the institute of mathematical statistics, founded in 1935, now has more than 1200 members; the econometric society and the psychometric society, both founded during the past 20 years have members which number in the hundreds. and there are at least a dozen other fairly new organizations which have strong interests in the use of statistics and statistical methods in various special fields. the extent of penetration is well indicated by the titles of the more than 100 papers presented at this 110th annual meeting of the association. any doubts that remain will be dissipated by looking through current government reports, by talking to men in business and industry about current problems, and by browsing through recent issues of research journals in astronomy, biology, chemistry, education, economics, engineering, geology, medicine, physics, psychology, or sociology. this rapid and far flung growth in the use of statistics and statistical methods has caught thousands of people with little or no training in statistics. they did not receive any when they were in high school or college. it is not surprising that we find so many people with so many different interests trying to pick up some training in the subject any way they can. some attend evening classes; some attend short courses and clinics; others simply read books. in our colleges and universities, we find instruction in elementary statistics being given by teachers in many departments and schools. many of these teachers have recognized, only in recent years, the significance of the rise of statistics for their own special fields of interest. they have taken the initiative of learning some statistics which they can use in their own research and can pass on to their students. these teachers have pioneered in helping to satisfy immediate instructional needs needs which would still be unfulfilled if they had not stepped forward. these efforts to meet an immediate requirement for instruction in statistics are highly commendable and are still urgently needed. no one seeing the magnitude of the statistical movement and of the shortage of personnel trained in statistics, can argue objectively that the job as a whole could have been done better some other way. but, even so, it is a fact, which we must recognize, that our statistical instruction has been ad hoc training for immediate purposes and not education adequate for our long range needs. as a whole and as it now stands, our statistical education structure is something like a group of temporary barracks which have been built in a hurry, built in piece meal fashion with very little design and built on poor foundations. if the need and value of statistics have any permanence in our society then there is no question but that this temporary structure must sooner or later give way to some kind of permanent building. in other words, we must see to it that college students who are likely to have to know something about statistics do not go through college in the future without learning the elements of the subject at least the elements! statistics in modern society the validity of the urgent need of a better educational set up for statistics must be based on the premise that statistics is fundamentally. important and in fact indispensable to modern society. it is already clear that this premise is well founded. but it is easy to give it further support by taking a little closer look at the role statistics now plays in government, business, industry, and scientific research. the basic purpose of statistics in government has been, and must continue to be, that of providing a systematic and effectively maintained body of information about social and economic activities and conditions of the city, county, state, or nation. this role, as far as federal government is concerned, has been excellently formulated by frederick c. mills and clarence d. long in their report on the ""statistical agencies of the federal government"" which was prepared for the hoover commission in 1948. to use their words: .. full account must be taken of the needs of a modern society for accurate current information concerning the processes of economic and social life. as the division of labor in economic affairs becomes more complex, as economic and social systems come to involve diverse combinations of selfadjusting and consciously controlled operations, as governmental structure itself becomes more highly developed, the need for current statistics is intensified. the supervision of interstate commerce and the regulation of the banking system, public utilities, and the exchanges must be guided by knowledge of a wide range of relevant facts. the formulation of policy and legislation relating to conservation, crime suppression, public health and social security, the provision of housing and education, the settlement of industrial disputes, the maintenance of economic opportunities and to other aspects of national life must be based upon accurate, current information. if the competitive enterprise system is to function effectively private decisions concerning investment, production, and distribution must proceed from a knowledge of market conditions much broader than that available to individuals guided only by their own observations. in war, even more than in peace, the facts of manpower and its distribution, of natural resources and national wealth, of the capacity and quality of industrial equipment, must be available promptly and in detail if mobilization and use of resources are to be effective. recent statistical developments have been marked not merely by an increase in the number of reports and in the extent of their use. the character of the contribution made by statistics to government and to private administration has been profoundly modified within the last quarter century. enumeration for purposes of historical study persists; the record of national life is contained in measurements of changes in population, production, wealth and other historical series. but, in high degree the emphasis in the work of the statistician has shifted from this backward looking process to cuttent affairs and to proposed future operations and their consequences. experiments are designed, samples selected, statistics collected and analyzed with reference to decisions that must be made, controls that must be exercised, judgments that entail action. the growth of the statistical services over the last several decades reflects this change in the function of statistics. the italics are mine, but the statement in italics has fundamental significance for statistics in the future. the implication is clear. the statistical process is becoming more and more widely used as a scientific method to be utilized as a basis for developing policy and as a basis for making decisions for administrative purposes, not only in government but in private administration. as for business and industry the uses of statistics and statistical analysis are rapidly mounting. the statistical quality control movement, due largely to w. a. shewhart, shows how fast statistical methods will spread within a segment of industry, when properly developed and introduced. there are other segments of the overall industrial process such as research and development, product testing, and market research, in which statistical methods are well on their way, others where the use of these methods has only just started, and still others virtually untouched. as business and industry become more complex executives will depend more and more on scientific statistical methods for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information and for decisionmaking. these methods will play an important role in ""operations research,"" an activity now confined largely to the scientific study of military operations, but which may eventually play an important role in the scientific analysis of business and industrial operations in connection with executive decision making. highly competent personnel will be needed in all of this work, and many of these persons will come from our business schools. the increasingly important part that statistics is playing on the frontier of nearly every scientific field is unmistakable if we are to judge by the growing occurrence of statistical analysis in research articles appearing in all kinds of scientific research journals. if these methods are not useful and effective in scientific investigations then a lot of scientists are fooling themselves and their hard to fool colleagues! now, let us turn from the technical role of statistics in our modern society to its significance in the general education of the intelligent citizen who graduates from college or even from high school. this citizen lives in a world of facts and figures. he makes decisions all of the time on the basis of large or small amounts of information. he carries on in a mass production economy. he is bombarded with advertising claims by every device of mass communication. he covers his risks by insurance. he occasionally plays poker, canasta or bridge, and sometimes gambles a little. his children take intelligence tests and their scores are reported to him. at present the only tools he has for critical evaluation and decision in all of these matters, are experience and common sense, and these often fail him. would anyone deny that this citizen would be able to carryon a little more intelligently in his complicated twentieth century environment if he had received a few of the elementary concepts of probability, statistics and logic at about the same time that he was exposed to plane geometry and trigonometry in high school? perhaps h. g. wells was right when he said ""statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write""! if this fundamental importance of statistics in our modern society is granted and i do not see how any reasonable person can deny it then we must concern ourselves with the problem of building a sound pattern of statistical education in our colleges and with introducing some of the important concepts into our high schools. it would be impossible in the space available here to go into a detailed discussion of the steps which might be taken eventually to ensure a sound scheme of statistical education in colleges and high schools and all of the implications of such steps. i can only hope to open up the subject by broadly outlining a few major steps which i believe should be considered and to hope that these proposals will provoke further thought and discussion' and some action. the central problem of undergraduate statistical education and a proposed solution the basic difficulty with our statistical education at present can be very simply stated it does not extend far enough down into our educational scale. this is, in part, due to the fact that the subject is relatively a newcomer. into our cultural pattern and educational system. its values have been discovered largely outside of academic walls while the elements of the subject have been seeping slowly into the colleges and universities through the top, by way of research, graduate courses and upper class courses. the elements of statistics have become almost frozen into the curriculum at these upper levels. it is gradually becoming recognized that there is a body of elementary concepts and basic skills in probability, statistics, logic, and experimental philosophy, together with a certain amount of prerequisite mathematics which constitutes the core of the scientific method which pervades modern experimentation and scientific investigation whatever the field may be. i shall simply call this body the ""elements of statistical analysis and inference"" and will not attempt to make a detailed outline of the specific topics, concepts, skills, processes and procedures which would be covered. others may wish to call it ""quantitative methods."" even after careful selection of material, this body is still bulky. effective presentation would be required in order to boil it down into a sequence of two full year courses. the eventual acceptance of this body of knowledge as fundamental in the early stages of training of students in the biological and social sciences will be particularly significant. for this will mean the emergence of a plan by which students of these sciences will receive disciplined training in certain principles of scientific method basic to those sciences early enough to be useful to them in later courses and thesis work. such a program would play a role in the biological and social 1 some aspects of the problem of statistical education in the united states were discussed in two reports published in 1947. ""personnel and training problems crested by the recent growth of applied statibtiob in the united states"" was issued in may, 1947 by the committee on applied mathematical statistics of the national research council. ""the teaching of statistics"" was issued in september 1947, by the committee on tea.chid.ll: of the institute of mathematical statistics. sciences similar to that now played by mathematics through calculus for the physical sciences and engineering. at the present time parts and bits of this material are scattered through upper class and graduate courses and given to the students too late. under the proposal being made here this material would be systematically organized and supplemented and would be presented early in college. for such a plan to be successful the body of concepts and skills to which we have referred will have to be moved down into freshman and sophomore courses, and students planning to go into the biological and social sciences will have to be required to take them as freshmen and sophomores. this would give them the foundation for the scientific method they will need in later courses and thesis work, just as students of the physical sciences and engineering now receive a foundation in classical mathematics through calculus in their freshman and sophomore years. i do not wish to imply here that physical science and engineering students do not need probability and statistics. they need much more than they are now receiving. probability theory is fundamental in such fields as quantum mechanics, nuclear theory and diffusion processes; modern statistical methods are now commonly used in the analysis of experimental results obtained in physical and chemical laboratories; statistical quality control is now a standard procedure in thousands of industrial mass production processes. the principles of statistical analysis and inference have filtered here and there into sophomore courses and in a few bold instances into freshman courses. but this filtering must be accelerated accelerated until these elements are taught as required courses for social and biological sciences in the freshman and sophomore years. in spite of the compelling logic of this situation there is some dissenting opinion. much of this contrary opinion bases its case on the assumption that freshmen or sophomores are too immature to understand or appreciate properly the fundamental concepts and basic skills of statistics. there are those who feel that it is necessary for the student of elementary statistical analysis to spend hours of computation on almost lifesized research problems and who then argue that such procedures do not mean much to freshmen and sophomores. it is true that such computation means little to freshmen and sophomores. but the first contention is faulty educational philosophy. by the same type of argument the aerodynamicist should learn all of the basic concepts and skills which he will need in designing a new type of wing by designing a wing, or the structural engineer should learn all the basic concepts and skills required for designing a new type of bridge by designing a bridge. actually, each of these men learns the needed concepts and skills systematically and step by step all along the way up through high school and college. there are others who argue that a student often does not know as a freshman or sophomore whether he will major in one of the social sciences, one of the biological sciences, business administration, etc., and how is he expected to know that he should study the elements of statistical analysis and inference at this early level? this argument only strengthens the case for concerted effort by departments in the biological and social sciences to see that early courses on these elements are established and required of students who enter those departments. it would soon become clear to students and faculty advisors that these courses must be taken early. after all, a similar principle operates for students in the physical sciences and engineering, with reference to two years of mathematics. what we need in statistics are elementary courses at elementary levels in which the student can concentrate on fundamental concepts and basic skiusin a graduated manner, doing just enough problems and laboratory exercises to fix these ideas without losing himself in the meaningless manipulation of formulas. if these elements are presented clearly and systematically to a student early in his college career he will be in a position to use them with facility and understanding in later courses, in thesis work, and in life sized problems. if properly organized this basic material can be presented eventually in a sequence of two fullyear courses, just as the basic mathematics for students in the physical sciences and engineering is now usually presented in two full year courses. as a practical matter it may be desirable to develop these courses in two stages: the first stage consisting of organizing material for the first course and trying it out for several years, and the second stage to be similarly devoted to the second course after the first course is running satisfactorily. some organizational aspects of the teaching of elementary statistics the elements of statistical analysis and inference are fundamentally the same when properly taught, whether in biology, economics, mathematics, psychology, or sociology. when the teaching of this material is reduced to its essentials it will become obvious to all, including college and university administrators, that such courses are general college courses. they will ask themselves whether such courses should be given by a half dozen departments or sponsored by some single department or committee. the answer to this question will differ from one college to another. in some cases departments of statistics will be created. in others, departments of mathematics will handle the courses. in others, special committees will sponsor the courses. it has been argued by some that the development and teaching of such courses should ultimately be made the responsibility of the departments of mathematics. one of the real difficulties with this latter possibility is the lack of understanding at least on the part of most of those departments of mathematics which lack at least one member thoroughly trained in probability and statistics of what is really needed in such courses. in general, departments of mathematics are so thoroughly bound by tradition to the classical mathematical preparation of students for the physical sciences and engineering that they find it difficult to imagine that students in the biological and social sciences need any training in quantitative methods at all, or if they do think these students need such training, they do not see why it should be any different from the classical mathematical training. of students in the physical sciences or engineering. a few departments of mathematics have not even introduced a modern course in probability and statistics for students in mathematics and the physical sciences although the job of meeting probability and statistics needs of such students is fairly simple since they are normally equipped with at least two years of college mathematics. but, thanks to the steady influence of the institute of mathematical statistics and a few strong centers in mathematical statistics, the number of departments of mathematics in this situation is rapidly vanishing. however, even fewer departments of mathematics have attacked the problem of statistics for undergraduate engineering students. this, too, could be done quite simply by introducing a good course in statistical quality control and in industrial experimentation. if the elementary material in statistical analysis and inference is organized into general college courses and brought to the freshman and sophomore levels, the upper class courses now covering elementary statistics in each department or field could be converted into courses which deal directly with the quantitative problems of that field courses in which elementary statistical methods could be used in stride and which would serve better the needs of the department or field. we would then approach a situation similar to that which exists in the physical sciences and engineering with respect to mathematics through calculus. the teachers of upper class courses in these subjects are not hampered by the job of having to stop and teach elementary mathematics to their students. they make immediate and uninhibited application, to the problems at hand, of basic mathematical concepts and skills, learned by the students as freshmen or sophomores. we must look forward to the time when teachers in the biological and social sciences will be able to make similar use of the elements of statistical analysis and inference. indications favorable to an early solution we have seen how elementary statistics has been introduced into our colleges and universities through the top, into graduate and upper class courses, and that there has been a tendency for it to become lodged at this upper level. but there are some definite indications of forces at work which may, in the near future, bring this instruction down to the freshman and sophomore levels where it belongs. first let us take a look at the social sciences. elbridge sibley of the social science research council made a very significant study in 1947 of ""the recruitment, selection and training of social scientists"" which throws much light on what graduate students in social sciences think about their own undergraduate training. questionnaires were filled out and returned by 581 social science graduate students (out of 1080 approached) and 575 natural science graduate students (out of 930 approached). one of the items of outstanding significance in this report is the fact that when asked what they regarded as the most serious deficiencies in their own undergraduate training, that mentioned with the greatest frequency by the social science students was training of a mathematical and statistical character. similar results were found by c. c. brigham in a study made in 1940 for the committee on research training of the social science research council which covered responses from 196 individuals out of the 330 engaged in research in different social sciences who were nominated by their respective professors in 20 leading universities as superior candidates who received ph.d. degrees during the period 1925 1935. by way of a mail questionnaire these individuals were asked to state what limitations in their training they now felt. of the 196 responding to the questionnaire 120 of them stated that they wish they had had more mathematical or statistical training or both. the testimony of social science students themselves as revealed by these two studies speaks louder than any words that can be set forth here of the desirability of moving on toward adequate training in quantitative methods at the undergraduate level for social science students. recent action has been taken in connection with the problem of mathematical training in the social sciences. a meeting sponsored by the econometric society, the institute of mathematical statistics, and the mathematical association of america discussed this subject in 1948. participants from economics, sociology, psychology, mathematics and statistics discussed various aspects of the problem. one of the results of this meeting was the adoption of a resolution that there be established a committee to make a thorough study of the problem of introducing adequate mathematics and statistics into the training of social scientists. such a committee has been set up under the chairmanship of w. g. madow and it has representatives from most of the social science organizations. this committee has an opportunity to render a unique service in helping to solve the problem of adequate training in mathematics and statistics for social science students. the problem of effective mathematical and statistical education for students in the biological sciences appears to be similar to that which exists in the social sciences. it would be illuminating to see the results of a study for the biological sciences similar to that made by sibley for the social sciences, and specifically to know what graduate students in the biological sciences think about their own mathematical and statistical preparation. the section on training and the biometric section of the association are in an excellent position to conduct a cooperative study of this problem and to take action which would be indicated by the results of such a study. the most encouraging indication that forces are at work in the biological sciences to direct more attention to statistical education is the rapid growth of the biometric section of this association and more recently of the biometric society, but, these forces have been operating mainly at research and advanced levels. sooner or later they must focus some attention on the problem of teaching the elements of statistical analysis and inference at the freshman and sophomore levels. with the expanding use of statistical methods in business both for internal control of operations within individual companies, and for market research, business forecasting, and other studies relating to outside conditions, it is extremely important that statistical training of business students be of the highest quality. donald r. belcher, now treasurer of the telephone and telegraph company, made the following excellent statement in 1924 about the role of the statistician in business and the need for improving the quality of his training: i submit then that the job of the statistician is to observe carefully and correctly, to treat his data honestly and dispassionately, to reason objectively from a set of conditions to their inevitable consequences; that nowhere else in his academic experience can he find so excellent a field for development as in the mathematical and physical sciences. this fact will, some day, i hope and believe, receive adequate recognition on the part of those men who are responsible for statistical training in the colleges. when the time arrives, we shall see statistical training characterized by a scientific dignity commensurate with the needs of the modern business world. although this statement was made more than 25 years ago, i wonder how much closer we are now to the goal mr. belcher had in mind? it would be very useful to know how graduates of business schools now employed in business feel about the statistical training they have received. the new section on economic and business statistics and the section on training could render a great service both to business and statistical education by jointly making a study of the adequacy of the statistical training of business students and taking appropriate action on the basis of such a study. statistical education in secondary schools if the elements of statistical analysis and inference are effectively organized into elementary courses and moved down into freshman and sophomore courses in our colleges and universities, the question will certainly arise as to what preparation in high school the student needs for these college courses. there is no doubt but that the study of mathematics in high school is an essential prerequisite for the study of statistical analysis and inference in college. the basic question is whether the mathematics curriculum in high school as now constituted is fully effective. the subject matter covered in algebra, plane geometry, trigonometry and solid geometry is classical. it has been developed over a long period of time as a part of a tradition for preparing students for the physical sciences and engineering in college and for developing ""clear, concise, and logical thinking"" in the intelligent citizen. there have been slight variations in order and manner of presentation of these subjects from one high school text book to another, but there has been no radical change in the subject matter during the time the concepts of probability and statistics have assumed such widespread importance in our society. this, of course, is to be expected since these concepts have not even become properly incorporated into our college curricula. but, looking forward to the time when some of the more elementary ideas of probability and statistics may be introduced into the high school curriculum we should consider at least some of the initial steps which might be taken. in my opinion the most obvious step to be considered is that of eliminating some of the fossilized subject matter from high school algebra, trigonometry, and particularly solid geometry and replacing it by subject matter from elementary probability, statistics and logic. in this day and l!'ge why should high school students spend a lot of time manipulating trigonometric identities, applying horner's method to location of roots of polynomials, and proving some of the theorems near the end of plane and solid geometry? the answer seems to be this: many high school teachers teach these subjects because they believe it is useful for students to know them when they get to college; the college teachers want them taught because they provide added practice in algebraic and other mathematical operations in which college students should have some proficiency. a thorough going study of the high school mathematics curriculum should be made by a joint committee of high school and college mathematics teachers in consultation with persons in the biological, physical and social sciences to determine to what extent some of these archaic topics can be supplanted by topics in elementary probability, statistics, logic, etc. such a committee would almost certainly find it possible to develop a solution along these lines which would provide the high school student with a background of concepts, skills and information more useful to him in his role as a college student or as a citizen than the one he now obtains. a background which would, at the same time, provide equal opportunities for acquiring proficiency in algebraic and other mathematical skills needed for pre engineering and pre physical science mathematics courses. such a project would require a great deal of initiative, imagination, and boldness, but, if done well, it would bring back some of the life which has vanished from high school mathematics, it would help rekindle mathematical interest among students with mathematical aptitude, and would certainly not diminish the qualities which high school mathematics is supposed to possess for developing ""clear, concise, and logical thinking"" in the average citizen. if, after thorough exploration of the possibility of eliminating some of the obsolete topics now taught in high school mathematics in favor of topics in probability, statistics, logic and other modern mathematical subjects, it does not appear feasible to overcome the inertia of tradition, then, of course, some other solution would have to be sought. one possibility might be to develop a course in this group of topics as has been done in physics and chemistry and use it as an alternative to the typical fourth year of high school mathematics, namely, solid geometry and trigonometry. such a course could be supplemented by carefully developed laboratory exercises covering simple examples chosen from various fields. the shortage of teachers at the present time a serious limiting factor in achieving better undergraduate statistical education is the shortage of highly qualified teachers. progress in developing such persons is very slow, and many of those trained to the ph.d. level are going into colleges and universities to carry on at research and upper class teaching levels, thereby doing little to directly remedy the present difficulties at lower undergraduate levels. others are going into government and some into industrial and business organizations. these people are all desperately needed where they are going. many of them will play key roles in the ultimate solution of our statistical education problem. but more effort must be made to develop, possibly in new ways, a larger group of teachers up to the stage where they can and will effectively teach courses in the elements of statistical analysis and inference in freshman and sophomore courses. this group should also include m.a. and b.a. students who go into high school teaching. the public relations of statistics i would now like to say a few words about the problem of public understanding of statistics. if a pattern of undergraduate statistical education is eventually built up along the lines i have indicated, the problem of public understanding of statistics and its role in modern society will be simpler than it is now. at least there will be many more people who will know something about the subject and its concepts. but, at the present time, and in spite of the phenomenal growth of statistics and its role in business, industry, government and scientific research the fact is that we are still living pretty much in mark twain's age of ""lies, damned lies, and statistics"" as far as the general public is concerned. with a few exceptions, statistics has made a poor impression in the eyes of the public. one of the most notable exceptions is the manner in which the statistical quality control movement has developed its public relations. this has been achieved through sustained effort based on a sound statistical development. there are many other sound statistical developments which are in great need of being presented effectively to major segments of the public by means of popular books and articles in magazines and newspapers. one of these is survey sampling and its many applications, another is design of experiments, a third is personnel selection by modern testing which is basically statistical. many others could be mentioned. effort on the public relations of statistics at the present time deserves high priority. the association has a new public relations committee under the chairmanship of a. n. watson, which has done excellent work during the year and especially in connection with this meeting. this committee deserves the full support of the association and its members in building better public relations for statistics. much initiative must, of course, rest with individual members of the association to prepare and publish popular or semi popular articles and expositions. the association and statistical education the statistical association is the oldest and largest statistical society in the united states. it has wielded strong influence throughout its long history in the improvement of statistics, especially in government, and in the struggle toward a profession of statistics. yet it is a conspicuous fact that in all of its 110 years of existence the association has only sporadically concerned itself with the problem of improving statistical training and education a problem which is absolutely vital in establishing a profession of statistics. until very recently, it has had only one formal skirmish with the problem. in 1925, and largely through the influence of r. e. chaddock, the president of the association at that time, a committee on educational and professional standards for statisticians consisting of five distinguished members of the association was established under the chairmanship of j. w. glover. the first task which this committee took upon itself was to make a survey and prepare a report on the nature and extent of statistical instruction in colleges and universities. one of the main results of this report was the discovery of very wide variation in the prerequisites and content of statistics courses from department to department within a college or a university. the committee expressed deep concern over the virtual absence of any mathematical prerequisites for statistics courses at upper class levels in some departments, and concluded its report with the following statement: this divergence in point of view and practice will probably continue for a long time and the employer looking for trained men not experts must judge for himself from which departments he will select his assistants. only time and experience will settle questions of this character and perhaps the results accomplished by the men who are trained along these different lines will eventually decide the matter. the glover committee also sponsored two sessions on the problem of instruction in statistics at the annual meeting of the association in december, 1925. papers were read by men from various fields including economics, sociology, business, public health, and biology. the general theme of these sessions was that the teaching of statistics was in a sad state and should be improved somehow or other. a great deal of consideration was given to the problem of training the expert in statistics. since 1925, occasional papers have been published on statistical education and a few sessions have been devoted to the subject at annual meetings. a project for an intensive study of the status of statistical training was considered in 1939 but was never carried through. no further association action was taken with respect to statistical education until 1944 at which time a special committee was appointed by helen walker, who was president of the association then, to consider the problem of statistical training. the work of this committee eventually led to the establishment of the section on training in 1947. this section is only just getting under way. its main efforts thus far have been devoted to the preparation of sessions for the annual meeting. but, with the pressures and opportunities now mounting for better statistical education at the lower undergraduate level the section faces very serious responsibilities. these responsibilities extend far beyond the job of merely organizing sessions on statistical teaching and training clinics for the annual meeting. they include the development of outlines of material and even texts for elementary courses, encouraging the preparation of articles on methods of teaching statistical concepts, consideration of problems of statistical education at the high school level, promoting ""statistics for the citizen,"" and many other activities. the section on training in cooperation with the section on economics and business statistics has the responsibility for making a thorough inquiry into the present status of specialized statistical training for students of economics and business beyond the general courses which have been proposed for freshmen and sophomores and making recommendations for improvements. similar opportunities and obligations exist for joint action between the section on training and each of the following: the biometrics section, the new committee on statistical methods in the physical sciences, the new committee on statistics in the social sciences, and the committee on public relations. the challenge before all of the statistical societies for the improvement of statistical education is great. at the advanced level progress is gradually being made in the various special fields like biometrics, psychometrics, econometrics, and mathematical statistics under the stimulation of the biometric, psychometric, and econometric societies and the institute of mathematical statistics. at the undergraduate level, we find no leadership anywhere; there is a state of general confusion. the time is ripe for some vigorous leadership. the association through its section on training is the only organization which can reasonably assume the leadership at this time. in taking the inititive, the section will gain the support not only of other sections and committees of the association, but of other statistical organizations, and of leaders in the biological and social sciences who realize the need for better statistical education. it must meet the challenge. summary in summary, i would like to emphasize in the strongest terms that one of the most serious problems that faces all of us who are directly or indirectly concerned with statistics as we enter the second half of the twentieth century is that of developing an adequate program for undergraduate statistical education. on an effective solution of this problem depends our ability to meet the training requirements which will be demanded by the role which statistics and statistical method will ultimately play in government, business, industry, and all types of scientific research. graduate and research training in both applied and theoretical statistics is now making satisfactory progress, thanks to the influence of the biometric, econometric, and psychometric societies and the institute of mathematical statistics and to the existence of a few strong advanced training centers in these various fields. the basic fault with our present statistical instruction is that it does not extend far enough down into our educational scale. much of it is hurried ad hoc training given mechanically and without adequate foundation and given too late to be useful to students while still in college. we have been and are still frantically devising all sorts of quick training courses to meet immediate needs of those who have gone through college without receiving any training in statistics. the situation is most critical for students going into social and biological sciences. we must now look to the job of correcting these faults in our undergraduate statistical education. the essence of the solution of the problem lies in (a) developing a sequence of two full year courses which will consist of concepts and skills mainly from probability, statistics, logic and experimental philosophy, together with some prerequisite mathematics, (b) placing these courses in the freshman and sophomore years, and (c) requiring students expecting to go into the social and biological sciences (including students of business) to take these courses as freshmen and sophomores. the proposed solution is based on the now widely supported assumption that students in these fields need basic training in scientific method appropriate to their fields analogous to that now received by engineering and physical science students in mathematics through calculus. taking these courses as freshmen and sophomores would permit students in these sciences an opportunity to begin building a foundation in scientific method for their fields at a stage early enough to enable them to use it in later college work. when this step has been taken it will be clear to all that the essential concepts and skills now commonly taught in beginning courses in statistics at upper class levels in various departments in our colleges and universities are basically the same in all courses. this will necessitate some kind of a coordinating committee or departmental responsibility in sponsoring such courses. the solution of the problem of providing effective undergraduate statistical training will raise the question of changes in the high school curriculum to provide better high school preparation for these college courses. the simplest solution to this question would be the replacement of certain obsolete topics now taught in high school algebra, plane and solid geometry and trigonometry by some topics in the elements of probability, statistics, and logic. such changes, when carefully made, would not only add significantly to the interest and value of high school mathematics for the average citizen, but would also provide ample opportunities for practice in algebraic and other mathematical operations in which proficiency is required for college mathematics. various factors have been discussed in this paper which indicate that the time is now ripe for some vigorous leadership in solving the problem of undergraduate statistical education. the only society which can reasonably assume the responsibility for this leadership is the statistical association through its section on training, acting in cooperation with the other association sections, the committee on statistical methods in the physical sciences, the committee on statistics in the social sciences, the public relations committee, and other statistical societies. it will receive the cooperation of many leaders in the biological and social sciences who realize the need for better statistical education and are convinced that action is needed. the challenge is great and it must be met.",275,27.6727272727273,5.24927726675427,0.193166885676741,7610,1470,20.7492493131048,15.7492493131048,10,0.992775593970841,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1951.10500763"

Reed","1940-1969","﻿the concept of planning is very common among human beings. man lives his life with his attention focused on the things of the moment, the events of the past, and his intentions as to the activities of the future. these intentions as to the future are commonly called plans, but in considering them it is necessary to distinguish those designs that are the almost involuntary response to preceding events from those that arise from deliberate thought and the weighing of relative values of different choices. it is not always easy to separate the deliberate from the involuntary decision. we may perhaps be aided in making a differentiation by pausing for a moment to look at the evidence that other animals do plan. our judgment as to whether other animals do make plans for the future is of necessity based on ouf observation of their acts and our interpretation of these acts. we speculate whether they were performed by instinct or came from a process that we would call thought if we saw such acts performed by man himself. we have the familiar instances of the harvesting and storing of food against winter needs on the part of a number of different animals. we tend to call it a response to instinct when we see squirrels gathering and storing nuts, whereas we are apt to consider that the human being collecting food for the winter is exhibiting conscious planning. i recently had an opportunity to observe animals under natural conditions engaged in enterprises sufficiently complex to make me speculate as to the extent to which the thought process was involved. a family of beavers settled into the swimming pool at my farm. at first we were delighted with the opportunity to observe them, but as they began to cut not only the shade trees but the apple trees in the orchard, we took steps to dispossess them. i first raised the gate of the dam thinking that with the pool gone they would leave. the next morning i found that about two thirds of the way up the pool they had constructed a very respectable dam of their own so that the water in the part of the pool they were using was within 8 or 10 inches of its previous position. that day i tore their dam completely down and early in the evening i took up an observation post on the bank of the stream at one end of their dam site. they furnished me several hours of entertainment. my first knowledge of their activity came from hearing a tree being cut in the vicinity. in a shorter time than i would have thought possible one of the pair came swimming silently down to my post with a small birch, 12 or 14 feet long, trailing behind him. his first move was to cut off a branch and carry it into the hole that formed their home. as he entered i could hear the pups whine at the approach of their evening meal. on his return to the outside he started on his own meal and although it may have little value as evidence of planning, you may be interested in his table manners. he first gathered the tip leaves and twigs of a small branch together with his front paws and fed this bundle into his mouth, tip first, his jaws going with a speed that made his teeth sound like a sewing machine. this rapid snipping of the leaves and twigs seemed to be all the chewing that he did. he then cut a branch about an inch in diameter so that he had a piece about twenty inches long, and taking it in his paws, he put it to his mouth as though he were going to playa flute. he then proceeded to eat the bark from the stick much as we would eat sweet corn from the cob. his appetite satisfied, he turned to the dam project and stripping off the branches, he took the birch pole that was about ten feet long and placed it diagonally across the stream with the butt resting against the bank. then, seizing the upper end with his paws and teeth, he rammed the butt end about a foot into the bank. at this point he went back into the woods for another tree and while he was gone, the female came out for the first time. she seemed disturbed to find the dam gone, examined the stick that had been laid and apparently not satisfied with its position, she pulled it out and placed it about two feet upstream. she then went back into the hole. when the male returned, he noticed at once that the pole had been moved, and after a good deal of investigation and consideration he moved the stick back to its original position. when he had gone for his next load, the female came out and moved the pole back to the position she had selected. when the male returned, he seemed to bow to the inevitable and the dam building proceeded. i have been asked if i was sure as to the sex, and if it might not have been the male that had the last word. i have to admit that i have no direct evidence on this question, but the whole procedure seemed so human that i feel 95% confident that this judgment is statistically acceptable. the subsequent steps in this seemingly designed experiment were to bring other trees, which were placed alternately on opposite banks and cross tied; to bring smaller pieces which were snarled into the structure; and as the dam floated on top of the water, to roll good sized cobble stones on top of the woven mass to weight it down; and finally, to mat mud and fine debris into it to make it hold back water. the entire evening's activity appeared to be a parental project designed to make suitable living conditions for the family. when we look at man's activities in the field of planning, we find many of them very similar to those of other animals. judged by action alone, they might as well be called response to instinct as thoughtful planning. on the other hand, we do know that man as an individual and in social aggregates does conscious planning for the future, and does attempt to carry these projects into action. i would like to speak of one aspect of man's planning in an individual sense that seems to me to have bearing on his social planning. when i look forward to next summer and plan to go to my summer place with my wife, when i correspond with my children as to the possibility of their being there at certain times, there is no doubt or uncertainty in my mind as to the individuals for whom i am planning. there is no need for prediction or statistical estimation as to the persons concerned. there may be uncertainties as to the plans themselves, but the persons for whom the plans are being made are clearly in mind. when we come to social planning, however, this is not the case. any planning for the future of the people of this country demands that we first make some prediction or estimation as to the number of people for whom we are planning. thus population prediction becomes a primary element of social planning. another distinction between planning at an individual level and at a social level arises from the fact that the subject of statistics plays a very small part in planning for the individual but plays a major role in planning for society. it is the role of statistics in this planning about which i wish to make a few comments. to lay down future programs of the type we are considering here, we need what we call facts. most of these facts we attempt to obtain in statistical terms. for example, if we are planning a program of medical services, we begin by developing statistics with regard to such things as medical resources, hospital facilities, by specified types, number of doctors and nurses available, number of people affected with illness by type and severity, the extent to which people have immunity to certain diseases, the degree to which by artificial means they can be immunized, and so on, ad infinitum. we are led from one issue to another as we develop in greater and greater detail our knowledge of physiology, disease, and medical activities. since most of our information is expressed in statistical terms, specialized statistical techniques for handling the data have been developed and this has led the statistician into the design of experiments for acquiring the basic knowledge, and has indeed led to real specialization of statisticians themselves. staying within the medical field and without attempting enumeration broadly throughout all areas of statistics, we now have specialists in hospital statistics, in quality control of laboratory processes, in bioassay, in the mathematics of biology, and so on. the degree of specialization within medical statistics is in fact somewhat similar to the degree of specialization of medicine itself. the extent of this is illustrated in professor cochran's experience when his daughter broke her arm. a call to a general practitioner met with the response that he did not handle children but suggested a pediatrician. the pediatrician when called said that he treated children, but did not set bones and suggested an orthopedist. the orthopedist said he did set bones and asked which arm it was, to which professor cochran, taking no chances asked, ""which arm do you set?"" it seems at times that the statisticians are proceeding to as high a degree of specialization as this. this detailed elaboration of statistics, a great deal of which is due to the advances of mathematical statistics, forms the basis upon which we are establishing a real statistical science. it is the type of activity which makes us proud of our profession, for although statistics is in its infancy in a scientific sense, it is certain to influence profoundly all future scientific thinking. on the other hand, as is the case with all movements toward specialization, broad objectives have a tendency to be lost in the wealth of intensive detail. this is particularly noticeable when one examines many of the attempts at social planning. we find various groups taking the abundance of statistical detail within their specific field and developing complex social plans without regard to the relation of this specialty to the whole. keeping still within my own field of medical and biological statistics, we find elaborate reports dealing with the statistics of medical services and facilities, doctor supply, nurse supply, and so forth, but we do not find attempts to integrate the proposed programs with similar programs in industry, business, education, or public service, to determine whether or not the plans in the aggregate have any relationship to the number of human beings for whom we are planning. there is almost no contact between the ideas of these specialized plans and the estimates that have been made of the future population. it is in this sense that our social planning differs very sharply from personal planning, for as i mentioned before, in the case of personal planning we are always very sharply conscious of the individuals for whom the plans are being made. there is little to be gained by planning from idealistic concepts, the number of nurses per 1,000 population, the number of school teachers per 1,000 school children, and so on, if these plans aggregate to a demand for more young women to carry them into effect than there are young women in the population. we may ask where the responsibility rests for providing this integration of our statistical facts into a total picture. i should reply that it rests on the statistician. just as we recognize the problem of analysis of man's observations as a process of statistical reasoning, so also should we view the problem of synthesis of knowledge into a complete picture. i have directed my remarks on this point mainly to social planning with illustrations drawn from the medical service field. the ideas apply, however, to all fields of statistical application. it is impossible to achieve comprehensive economic or business planning within the framework of economic and business statistics alone and assume that the demographic issues have been taken care of by such simple indices as dollars or quantity of goods per person. the factors of population growth must be woven into the analysis as an integral part of the problem. analysis is always easier than synthesis. in any field of human activity it is simpler to obtain individual bits of knowledge than it is to put those bits together into a general pattern of human behavior. so also in the various fields of science, it is easier to obtain specific pieces of scientific observation than it is to put those pieces together to form a general scientific law. the process of reasoning involved in integration or synthesis is, however, statistical in character, and i should hope that the statisticians of the future would take synthesis as well as analysis as a part of their responsibility and would playa leading role not only in the planning of broad programs, but also in the

(there had been some other instances of this kind previously, but they had not been so important.) all at once, detailed economic statistics were in demand for determination of allocations of materials or of shipping space, or for price or wage regulation, or for other control purposes. those statistics at hand were seized upon, whether or not they were really suitable for control purposes. if no statistics were available, a special purpose survey was usually hurriedly devised, often with sampling errors of undetermined magnitude. here, a mistake in classification, in tabulation, or, most important, in the framing of the questions or in the interpretation of the data, had immediate repercussions upon business firms, their employees, and the defense program itself. the statistical profession, it is clear, was quite unprepared for the war emergency. yet those special wartime statistics were discontinued, with considerable enthusiasm, as soon as controls ended, only to be partially and hastily reassembled for the defense program in 1950. clearly, economists and statisticians have still not provided the public with a design for an adequate, integrated economic intelligence system, based upon sound statistical standards for use in such emergencies. we have not even provided a first blueprint of such a plan. in still another field, statistics have been used more and more as evidence admissible in court. both detailed studies relating to particular firms or industries and broad economic indicators appear in attorneys' briefs and exhibits. statistics are also used by the federal trade commission and the department of justice in deciding whether to prosecute a case. the so called concentration ratios employed in anti trust prosecutions are an example. still more recently, statistics have come to be used as automatic regulators or governors, in the engineer's use of that term. they have been written into law as ""trigger figures,"" determining automatically whether certain actions take place. they have been written into contracts between private firms and individuals, and between governments and private individuals. they have thus come to determine what prices millions of farmers get for their crops, or other millions of workers get for their day's work, or the amount of taxes a business enterprise must pay, or what actual dollar price a producing company receives for a new generator. consider for a moment some of these statistical governors. we are familiar with them, but not necessarily with their new uses. the oldest in the united states is the census, under the constitutional provision whereby the number of representatives for each state in the house of representatives shall be determined by the congress on the basis of a census of the population taken once every 10 years. thus, since the census of 1950, more representatives come from california and fewer from pennsylvania. these census calculations are generally accepted, since this is their primary purpose. then, in point of time, there is the parity index, another specially constructed statistical governor. it was devised by congress after long and bitter agricultural depression, as a yardstick against which to measure farm prices or the farmer's fair share of the national product in comparison with the industry from which he buys and to which he sells. this yardstick so complex that few economists and too few farmers understand it is a ratio of indexes of prices paid by farmers to prices received by farmers, hooked back to a pre world war i base of 1910 14. today, price supports covering some 40 percent of the sales value of farm commodities are based upon the parity index and parity prices. congress, having fixed the base period of 1910 14 by law, later amended the act to add farm wages to the index of prices farmers pay, and to more or less modernize the price relationships as between the individual farm commodities. but for the most part, the parity index continues, with occasional quiet revisions by its custodians in the bureau of agricultural economics, as one of the main factors governing the receipts of millions of farmers. then there are several statistical measures of which the bureau of labor statistics is custodian, which have similar uses as ""triggers"" or governors, only one of which was especially compiled for such purposes. to take the most recent example first: the bureau's statistics on housing starts have just been used, under an act passed by the congress in the summer of 1952, as a determinant of the time at which the federal reserve limitations on housing credit under the so called ""regulation x"" were suspended. these statistics were originally designed as a descriptive measure of the approximate number of new dwellings started in non farm areas. they were then not calculated on the basis of a seasonally adjusted annual rate, as called for in the act passed by the congress, and so a difficult and necessarily rough seasonal calculation had to be made. moreover, the preliminary form in which they are compiled has sizable potential errors for three months, until final returns come in. yet the act provided that they were to be used as ""trigger figures"" to suspend these particular credit regulations. it is fortunate that the level of home building activity in the summer and early autumn of 1952, when this act became effective, fell so far short of the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts specified in the act that the decision to suspend regulation x could be made with statistical confidence. it could easily have been otherwise. a similar ""trigger"" use of the consumers' price index was considered when the defense production act of 1950 was being debated in the congress. in fact, this particular provision once passed the house of representatives. it provided that price and wage controls during the defense emergency were to go into effect when the consumers' price index had advanced by 5.percent from a given date. however, it was pointed out to members of the congress that the consumers' price index, being made up of retail prices, would move late and slowly, and that prices of raw materials and industrial products might have sky rocketed before the consumers' price index had moved by the suggested amount. by then it would have been too late for effective price control measures. consequently, this particular proposal was dropped. the venerable wholesale pnce index of the bureau of labor statistics has also been extensively used as an escalator in business contracts during and since world war ii. when this index was revised early in 1952, it was found that thousands of private contracts involving billions of dollars contained escalator clauses by which the amount to be paid by the purchaser varied automatically with the wholesale index or some component of it. these contracts include government contracts for such equipment as ships, which require several years to construct; many private contracts for heavy equipment or maintenance, such as generators or elevator maintenance; long term leases on commercial and industrial properties; public utility rates in one state; and a variety of other contracts. in certain of these contracts in which the materials component varies with wholesale prices of materials, the wage component escalates on average hourly earnings, as compiled by the bureau of labor statistics in connection with its nation wide monthly survey of manufacturing employment, hours and earnings. this compilation of earnings, while it is very comprehensive, is not intended to be accurate to the last penny. another statistical series in the bureau of labor statistics used for escalation purposes is the lifo (last in first out) price index, especially compiled at private expense for the use of department stores in calculating allowable changes in inventory values for tax purposes, under an agreement with the bureau of internal revenue. then there is the well known use of the consumers' price index in wage contracts, under which wages change immediately and automatically at regular intervals, usually quarterly, whenever there is a specified change in the index. there are also many instances of agreements in which wages or other income payments are subject to renegotiation or reconsideration upon a specified change in the index. in addition to wage contracts, the consumers' price index is used in many other ways as an escalator for example, in leases for residential buildings, for payments for family maintenance, such as relief payments and alimony payments. these are private contracts negotiated by industry and labor and by private individuals, usually without consultation with the agency which issues the figures. some of them are fairly long term, like leases for residential buildings, or in the wage field, like the general motors five year contract. others are for only a year or two. in addition to these governmental statistics, there are a number of privately compiled yardsticks which serve similar purposes. review, now, the effect that these statistics have. a state gains or loses a congressman; farmers do or do not get loans on their crops; an industrial producer does or does not get a higher price for his products; a tax bill diminishes or increases; wages go up or down. it is no exaggeration to talk of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars being involved. let me be specific: take the case of wage contracts tied to the consumers' price index. in most of these wage contracts, a change of 1 point or 1.14 points on the present index, which in 1952 has varied around 190 percent of the 1935 39 average, means a change of one cent an hour in wage rates. an increase of one cent an hour for a 40 hour week for 50 weeks out of the year for 3,500,000 workers known, at a minimum, to be under such contracts, means $70,000,000. this does not count millions of other employees whose wages or salaries may follow suit along with the index. testimony before a subcommittee of the house committee on education and labor, under the chairmanship of congressman steed, which held hearings on the consumers' price index in 1951, indicated that one cent an hour totaled $8,000,000 a year for the general motors corporation alone, and $30,000,000 for the railroads, which have over 1,000,000 employees under such contracts.' the tables in these wage contracts are set up in brackets of 1 or 1.14 points, by tenths of a point on the index. thus, at the margins of those wage brackets, if the index rises or falls by one tenth, hundreds of millions of dollars are immediately involved. uses of statistics such as these imply a faith in statistics of which statisticians can be very proud. h statistics and statistical agencies in the united states were not trusted or had not earned a right to public confidence, all this would never have happened. we accept the accolade, but like the lord chancellor in iolanthe we say, a little wryly, ""but though the compliment implied inflates me with legitimate pride, it nevertheless can't be denied that it has its inconvenient side."" such responsibility as this is very sobering. these statistics were usually created, as i have said, for descriptive and analytical purposes, and machinery for their production was geared to more or less leisurely uses by people who were assumed to be reasonably familiar with their construction and their technical limitations. the checking devices, the revision programs, the publicity plans, were not laid out with a view to such awesome uses as these, by a wide, often unknown, and statistically unsophisticated public. the producing agencies have had to change their practices; to speed up their calculations; to guard their results from ""leaks""; and greatly to expand their public consulting machinery. as never before, they are operating in a goldfish bowl. they are being advised by numerous committees appointed from the ranks of industry, labor, and technical groups. these advisory committees convey the statistical needs of the groups from which they come to the governmental agencies, and often provide technical advice as well. this type of advisory committee should be continued and expanded if government statistics are to continue to serve broad public uses. i can say from personal experience that, while these governmental agencies did not seek the exceptional responsibility which the new uses of our statistics have introduced, they have taken the responsibility very seriously. in the opinion of impartial observers, such as the task force headed by professor frederick c. mills for the hoover commission, the important statistical series produced in government are now administered with competence and honesty and a good deal of skill. that is not to say that they could not be improved, for they could be. but the statisticians who make these statistics know better than anyone that they were never intended to be accurate to the last decimal, as many of their users believe them to be. by this i do not mean that these statistics are not correctly calculated arithmetically. as i have just indicated, i believe they are. arithmetic is easy to check, and statisticians as a rule do arithmetic well. most of these major economic indicators are either double calculated by two different sets of clerks, or they have built in mechanical checks of various kinds. of course, there are bound to be occasional errors. no system is infallible. but those errors are accidental. so don't worry about that last decimal! the figures will usually be arithmetically correct, according to the ground rules laid down for the calculation in question. you cannot ""rig"" a summary figure with 150,000 prices, or millions of people, in it, calculated by a whole battery of individuals, even if someone wanted to and i do not believe they do. rather, i am referring to accuracy in its statistical sense. this depends upon the ground rules. the question is: was this statistical series designed, like the standard meter or the inch, to be accurate to a very small fraction of a point? for most of these general purpose national economic indicators, the answer, of course, is ""no."" i repeat no such accuracy was needed for the purposes for which these statistics were designed. it is not built into the calculations. but, given careful observance of the ground rules, a summary index is usually as correct one time as another, and hence will measure changes from time to time with equal accuracy, except in most unusual circumstances. it must be accepted as it stands, and the public must know that. the next question, then, is: did the users choose the proper statistics? are these indicators really suitable for some of their new uses? obviously, that question can be answered only with reference to specific cases. but take the major ones: of the indicators i have named, only the census, the parity indexes, the lifo index, and some of the privately constructed indexes were designed for the specific purposes which they now serve and none of them is accurate to the last digit, nor is that kind of accuracy required, in my opinion. however, in many cases, i believe that the other, more general, indicators have also served their new uses well. most of the statistics which are currently used as automatic ""governors"" are price indexes, except for the residential construction statistics. they have, in effect, provided insurance to the parties to contracts against wide swings in the price level. without discussing the more fundamental economic questions involved in these escalator clauses, may i merely say that there has rarely been a time in our recent history when insurance against price changes was so appropriate, or when the price swings were so wide that an approximate indicator was good enough to deal out rough justice to the parties concerned, provided they chose the appropriate statistical series in the first instance. and for many of the large contracts this has been true. now, given these new, more weighty, and more widespread uses of statistics, what do we, as statisticians, owe the trusting public which accepts our products on faith, often with a fateful sentence which begins, ""statistics prove that .. "" we owe the public, i believe, these things: arithmetic accuracy; continuing observance of the ground rules for compilation, or a warning if they are to be changed; fairness and impartiality in handling the results; a clear description of the general nature and limitations of statistics, with a simple measure of their accuracy, if it can be measured, and a warning if it cannot. we cannot, and we should not, try to explain every technical detail, or to make statisticians of everyone, any more than all of us should try to understand all the mechanical details of how our automobiles work. we owe the public also, if we are asked, advice as to whether a certain statistical measure is suitable for a given use or not, and an education in the fact that statistics must and will change. they cannot be expected to be compiled in exactly the same way indefinitely. they get out of repair and go out of fashion, just like other products, if they are not revised from time to time, and so responsible statistical agencies do revise them. what would you think of a city consumers' price index which today had the lamp chimneys and high button shoes of 1900? you may be sure that some of the articles in the indexes of today will look just as peculiar in 25 years. therefore, anyone making a contract or setting up any other long term use for a statistical series should be told that he should make provision for periodic shift overs to revised statistics, if he does not wish to upset the contract. in my opinion, it would be wise also to provide for periodic review of whether circumstances have so changed that other measures or no statistical measures at all would be preferable. for example, it should be remembered by those who employ price indexes in contracts that in periods of price stability, which have not been uncommon in our history, such escalators as these indexes provide may either not be needed, or since they are only approximate measures of trends, they may not be accurate to a sufficiently fine point so that their changes have any real significance. the public should know, too, that there is no real assurance that the statistics they use today will be issued at all 10, 15, or 50 years from now. although they are authorized by law, there is nothing except custom and the enthusiasm of their sponsors to keep them going, except, as in the case of the census, or the parity index, where they have a statutory directive. other statistics may be discontinued because they have served their primary purpose although this is unlikely to be true of the major economic indexes or they may be changed or eliminated because of lack of basic data or of financial or organization support. in general, in government, as in private agencies, budgets are reviewed each year and they are often changed, with considerable danger to the continuity of statistical service. ab the steed subcommittee of the house committee on education and labor observed in its report on the consumers' price index in 1951:2 ""the subcommittee believes that the consumers' price index has become 80 important that it must be regarded as a fixed charge upon the government; it should not be subject to yearly fluctuations in budget and at the same time be required to do the same amount of work...• unlike some government programs, the issuance of a statistic of this type depends almost completely upon continuity of effort. it is impossible to cut the work one year and increase it the next on the same project.... "" therefore, the users of statistics and the profession must be educated to take some responsibility for continuity of statistics where that is important for today it is not assured. finally, statisticians owe the public, i believe, absolute assurance of continued competence, of honesty and fairness in the calculation of these statistics and indeed of all major statistics, whether they are ""trigger figures"" or not. note, i say ""assurance."" i mean that we, as statisticians, need not merely to be competent, fair, and honest, but we need to be able to prove to a statistically unsophisticated public that, in fact, our statistics are trustworthy. this is not merely a public relations problem, although its public relations aspects are very important, but one of fundamental, long run institutional changes which will assure that statistics continue to serve in the public interest. i believe that the statistical profession and its sister professions in the social and the natural sciences, where statistics are used, should immediately take the initiative and assume responsibility for this public assurance. consider what we do not have in our profession, which other professions have. there is in our profession, for example, nothing comparable to the certified public accountant, or ""member of the college of surgeons."" there is no such label as a ""certified public statistician."" there is no certification of the source of statistics like the stamp ""u.s. inspected choice, good or commercial,"" and few statistical brand names that mean anything except to the statistically sophisticated. moreover, for our products, there cannot be standardization, and there is only voluntary labeling of the contents, in footnotes which are often too technical for the public. there is no audit comparable to the audit of a firm of certified public accountants, invited by a corporation to audit its books, in order to assure the stockholders and the public not merely of the accuracy of the arithmetic of its accounting, but also of the validity of the way in which the books are kept. the time has come, in my opinion, for the statistical profession, in its own interest, to consider devising some means by which these functions can be performed for important statistical series. such a suggestion implies no doubt of the present validity of existing statistics, nor should it be considered to reflect in any way upon the professional standing or integrity of the statisticians concerned. an accountant does not feel incompetent because he is not a cpa, but for certain work a cpa is required; a company is proud of a ""u.s. inspected"" label; an accountant does not feel that it reflects on his integrity because an out side accounting firm audits his books. in fact, he welcomes the verification of his procedures and his accuracy. and so should statisticians. what are those guarantees? what underlies them? the fundamental guarantee of integrity of any statistics, now or in the future, in public or private agencies, as the mills committees observed, lies in the quality and the competence of the people who compile them. while there is no statistical equivalent of admission to the bar, over the past three decades we all know that there has been a great improvement in the quality of statistical work; in basic statistical training in the colleges; and in standards set for statisticians in public and private agencies. there are now advanced degrees in statistics, with fine training in methodology. in the public service, this association has helped the civil service commission to define standards for various grades of work. what is now most lacking in statistical training in colleges, i believe, is an adequate appreciation of the fact that statistics are tools to be applied to subject matter. a highly trained mathematical statistician without knowledge of the subject can be quite as dangerous as a subject matter specialist trying to use statistical methods of which he has little knowledge. statistical students should therefore be given a well rounded training in both areas. advanced statistical training should certainly involve practical field work experience wherever that is at all feasible. in view of the fact that statistics today are big business, students should be taught how the important, large scale statistics are made, and how the individual statistician's role is often to serve as one cog in a big, intricate, mass production process. teachers will also do well to give emphasis to an uncodified, but nonetheless real, standard of ethics, which demands of the statistician accuracy, impartiality, and integrity in all of his work. beyond good training, comes experience in formulating a statistical project, defining the terms, managing a study. the crucial nature of this area of statistical administration is too little recognized. these new uses of statistics make it all important. with these considerations in mind, i hope that this association will take positive action to carry out some of the excellent suggestions on training made by samuel wilks when he was president of this association; and at the same time, consider again the possibility of setting up examinations for certified public statisticians, remembering that that label should only be applied to those who have been proved competent in method, in subject matter, and in application. finally, i come to the question of reassuring the public that statistics which are so widely used in the public interest are competently and fairly compiled, and are designed to meet public needs adequately. it is time, i believe, for the profession as a whole to share some responsibility for these statistics with those who make them. since so many of the important statistical governors and statistics used for policy making purposes in the united states originate in federal statistical agencies, we might first consider how this problem could be handled for government statistics. (and here i must emphasize that i speak as a private individual, and not as a representative of a government agency.) i propose that there be created a new united states statistical commission, with responsibility for audit of statistical series, similar to an accounting audit, empowered to put a ""certified"" label on a statistical product. it should also be charged with investigation of methods, scope, and suitability of statistics, and with making recommendations for future improvements and developmental work. such a commission in some respects would be similar to the ""boards of visitors"" which some universities have organized to report to the board of trustees; in others like the inspector general of the army; and in others like the present research and development board in scientific fields. the members of such a commission might be selected from a panel of names suggested by this association and allied associations dealing with important subjects to be considered by the commission. primarily, its membership would be drawn from experts outside government who have had actual experience in such operating problems as are faced in governmental statistics, in addition to knowledge of methodology. like the united states central statistical board, created in 1933, however, it might also have as members heads of some of the important federal statistical agencies, serving either ex officioor on a consultative basis, where questions of scope and method were involved, but not, of course, an audit of their statistics. it should be a continuing body, serving on occasion as required, but with a small full time staff, and adequate financing, so that our most distinguished statisticians, economists, scientists, and other specialists could reasonably be expected to devote time and attention to its work. its reports should be made to the highest executive authority, and be generally available to the congress and to the public. in making an audit of an important series, such a commission should rely on sample checks to verify the accuracy of the basic data and the calculations, and should carefully examine the established procedures to see whether they are being followed scrupulously. it should devote a good share of its attention to making suggestions for changes in procedures, if those currently in vogue are not in accordance with the best methods known at the time of review, and to considering whether the data are technically adequate for the uses which are being made of them. after such an examination, the commission should be in a position to give these statistics a stamp of approval ""certified public statistics"" or to withhold that stamp awaiting improvement and say why. i, for one, would welcome the constructive suggestions and the heightened public interest that would come from such a review. private statistical series might also be reviewed by the commission, on request. to set up such a commission will involve both institutional inventiveness and new ways and means. i cannot venture to propose a workable blueprint in all its details, but i can observe that, for government statistics, this is certainly an opportune moment for the creation of such a statistical commission. this idea, of course, is by no means original. a central commission of statistics, quite large in size and with somewhat different functions than i am suggesting, has operated with considerable success in the netherlands since the 1890's, and we might learn from their experience. the general goals i have outlined will not be easy to accomplish: to lift the level of statistical public relations; to make statistical training more realistic; to devise means for establishing the title of ""certified public statistician""; to set up an independent commission to review and pass upon our most important statistics, governmental and private. but our profession has made some first steps in these directions. this association has for many years appointed advisory committees to various governmental agencies, at their request the bureau of the census, the bureau of labor statistics, the bureau of mines, and others. these committees have served most usefully in dealing both with program content and with statistical techniques. similar committees should continue to be appointed in the future. however, they have performed advisory functions of a somewhat different character than are intended for the proposed new commission. the committee on government statistics and information services of 1933, out of which came the u. s. central statistical board and its current successor, the office of statistical standards, was very valuable. certainly the level of governmental statistics has been raised during the past 20 years, in consequence of its work. the contribution of the report of the mills task force to the hoover commission, on government statistics, is such another step. our association's commission on statistical standards was created with a much more limited scope, but also in the direction of such functions as are proposed for a statistical commission. its subcommittees which participated with the social science research council in reviewing the results of the election polls in 1948 and of the statistics underlying the kinsey report were both very worth while. this commission has not been very active, for it is voluntary and part time, and has no organic relationship to statistical organizations as such. these few steps, however, are evidence of professional recognition of some of the problems that are before us. recently, these problems have become much more serious, for statistics have suddenly attained stature beyond our hopes and perhaps beyond our desires. their importance goes beyond our present ability to handle the problems which these new uses create with the imagination and authority which the situation requires, as a profession, statisticians must organize to meet this challenge if statistics are to continue to be administered in the public interest.",265,22.4150943396226,5.01430976430976,0.240909090909091,5940,1431,17.7172403278064,12.7172403278064,30,1.27584513294817,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1953.10483451"

Cochran","1940-1969","five years ago, the association adopted a new constitution which was intended to facilitate substantial changes in the nature of the association. written constitutions are not noted for their ability to grip and hold the reader's interest, and i doubt whether many members paid more attention to the new constitution than was necessary in deciding how to vote on it in 1948. consequently, i would like to present some impressions of the experience of the association during the first five years of operation under the new constitution. i hope that this account will give members a better picture of the present nature of the association and will lead up to several questions concerning our future development about which i wish to encourage members to do some thinking. the situation as it appeared in 1945 planning for a new constitution began when the association was able to resume normal activities towards the end of world war ii. in the early discussions about a suitable future pattern for the association, the committee at work on the new constitution took note of four developments in the field of statistics that seemed relevant. 1. statistical techniques had penetrated into a great variety of fields. up till about 30 years ago, practical statistics dealt mainly with applications to economics, business and government, and the interests of the association's members tended to reflect this fact. it is easy to exaggerate the extent to which this was so: the association has always welcomed statisticians in any field of knowledge and 30 or 40 years ago the journal was publishing important papers on a wide range of topics. but the organized activities of the association dealt largely with applications in the economic sphere. in the 30's, however, and still more in the early 40's, the increased use of statistical ideas and techniques in such fields as psychology, the various branches of biology, medicine, the social sciences, industrial research and operations, and marketing was a striking phenomenon. 2. during the same period, persons interested in these other developments had founded a number of new societies, among them the institute of mathematical statistics, the econometric society, the psychometric society and the society for quality control. all these societies were strongly concerned with statistical techniques, but none of them had any formal relation to the asa. 3. the membership of the asa was increasing and might be expected to grow rapidly in the post war years. in 1945 there were about 3,300 members, at present there are close to 5,000. 4. with the formation of the united nations, some of its agencies might be expected to foster new developments in international statistics. in considering the future of the association in the light of these factors, two principal choices appeared to be open. the association might continue to give primary attention to applications in economics, leaving applications in other fields to be taken care of by other societies. this would have been a reasonable course of action. although the association had received an influx of members whose interests were in other fields, the primary concern of over half the members in 1945 was still with applications to economics or business, as revealed by the 1945 directory. the second course, the one actually adopted, was to try to give the association a central role with regard to all fields of application of statistics. this decision was advocated by almost all members whose opinions were sought. it was a wise decision from many points of view, particularly when no one knew where important statistical applications might turn up next, when statistical activities were being parcelled out amongst numerous societies and when a strong national body might accomplish much in cooperation with international agencies. we should recognize, however, that the decision involved a real sacrifice, at least for a time, by the members in economics and business, since a relatively homogeneous society catering satisfactorily to them was to be changed into something more amorphous whose future course was harder to predict. these members accepted and encouraged the change with excellent spirit and with, as might be expected, occasional grumbles. some provisions of the 1948 constitution the decision having been taken, the new constitution was constructed so as to introduce a number of devices that would make the desired changes easier to accomplish. i would like to describe the purposes, as i understand them, of some of the principal provisions in the 1948 constitution. associated and affiliated societies. one of the most difficult questions was: what was to be the relation between the asa and the other societies dealing with some aspect of statistics that had come into being or might be established in the future? much thought was given to this question, including a study of various mechanisms that had been adopted by other large central organizations. finally, it was decided to try two provisions, called association and affiliation. any other society interested in the objects of the asa may apply to become an associated or an affiliated society. the status of an associated society is intended for societies whose interest in statistics is strong: that of an affiliated society was intended to cover a looser type of connection, but since this provision was dropped in our recent minor revision of the constitution, i will not go into detail about it. proposals for association are examined by our board of directors and council before a decision is taken to grant the status. each associated society receives the right to appoint two members to the council of the asa, one member to the editorial board of the statistician, and one member to the asa committee on publications for each periodical which it publishes. the asa is required to offer its publications to the members of associated societies on the same basis as to asa members, and vice versa. the arrangement involves a slight loss of autonomy by the asa. in return, it establishes a definite method of liaison, makes our council more representative of statistical interests as a whole, and puts us in a better position to play the kind of central role that was considered desirable. sections and section committees. if the asa is to be a society whose members have a great variety of interests, what can be done to ensure that each of the principal interest groups within the membership participates to its own satisfaction? for dealing with this problem, the asa had a successful precedent in the biometrics section, which had been in existence for a number of years. although only a small fraction of the membership was interested in biometry as such, this section arranged programs at each annual meeting, held joint sessions at the meetings of a number of the biological societies and published the biometrics bulletin with financial backing from the asa. the 1948 constitution encouraged the formation of sections in other broad areas by providing for the establishment of section committees. the general function of section committees is ""to further the development of statistics in fields not adequately covered at present by associated or affiliated societies."" (article x, 8). these committees are represented on the asa program committee in order to arrange programs in their individual areas. in course of time, a section committee may draw up a charter which on approval leads to the formation of a section. the new constitution looks still further ahead by providing that when a section has grown large enough, the section committee may take the initiative in organizing an associated society. districts and district committees. in nation wide societies that are small, meetings tend to be on a national level. as the society grows in numbers, it becomes feasible to hold regional meetings which give more of the members a chance to participate. in the asa we have been fortunate in having a long tradition of meetings both at the national level and through our chapters at the local level. in order to encourage activities and meetings at an intermediate regional level, the constitution provides for the setting up of geographical districts. in each, there is a district committee, with two members from each asa chapter and from each local unit, if there are any, of any associated or affiliated society. the district committees thus provide a means for coordinating the activities of the asa and related societies at both the the local and regional levels. council. finally, in order to give the membership a broader representation in the administration of the asa, the constitution created a new policy making body, the council. this consists of the board of directors, the editor of each asa publication, two representatives from each district and one from each section committee with more than 75 members, as well as representatives of associated societies and an equal number of representatives at large. the board of directors, which in former times was the governing body, now serves as the executive committee of the council. during 1953, the council had 34 members, as compared with 13 on the board. the association's experience under the 1948 constitution i would now like to describe how the new devices have operated during the past 5 years. in cases where things have not as yet worked quite as actively as was hoped, i do not want to give the impression of washing dirty linen in public, which would be most reprehensible for a president. my defense would be that this linen is not dirty, and it is not being washed, but merely aired. associated societies. up to the present time, only one organization has become linked to us through this provision the east north region of the biometric society, which might be regarded as one of our own children grown up, since the biometric society is a natural outgrowth of our biometrics section. this modest beginning is not surprising, because no strenuous efforts have been made to bring the provision to the attention of other societies. in my opinion, it is advisable to wait until the asa has settled down under the new constitution before exploring with some of the other societies the possibility of a closer relationship, although we have progressed far enough so that any good opportunity for initiating discussions should not be missed. perhaps the most propitious times will be when cooperation has already arisen about some matter of mutual interest, or when a new society has been launched with the guidance of the asa. with the older societies, we may also have to recognize and handle tactfully a problem of prestige. some members of these societies may feel that association implies in some way a recognition of a lower status. no such status was intended in framing these provisions, under which the asa sacrifices some autonomy, but the other society does not, as is clearly stated in our constitution. sectionsand section committees. excellent progress has been made in establishing a well rounded group of sections. this year, the section on social statistics has been added to those on biometrics, business and economic statistics and training in statistics. a committee on statistics in the physical sciences has been at work for 2 years. jointly these 5 areas appear comprehensive enough to cover the major interests of practically all our members, at least for the time being. perhaps the largest single group unrepresented by a section are the members whose primary interest is in statistical theory. so long as the institute of mathematical statistics continues to meet with us, as it has done consistently in the past, such members are unlikely to regard themselves as neglected. in arranging the large number of sessions (currently around 50) which now comprise the program at the annual meeting, the section representatives have worked most efficiently and amicably, and i believe that we have a smooth mechanism for accomplishing this complicated task. the section committees have also been active in varying degrees in other projects, and have been called upon on numerous occasions for advice by the board and council. districts and district committees. activity in arranging meetings of something approaching a regional character, which was one of the primary intentions in setting up districts, has proceeded satisfactorily. the initiative, however, has come from different directions on different occasions. the interesting programs at the united nations headquarters in new york in 1952 and 1953 were a joint venture by several chapters. the successful series of institutes at the universities of of illinois and pennsylvania and at the carnegie institute of technology involved cooperative planning among a number of groups, prominent among them being the business and economic statistics section. the regional meeting to be held in san francisco in december, 1954, will be the responsibility of the western district. thus, what was perhaps the principal object in setting up district committees is being achieved, although the committees themselves have not been uniformly active. the council. in creating the council, the intent was to give the membership a larger role in the policy making of the asa and perhaps also to allow for more deliberation on policy problems. i think it is fair to say that these aims have not been fulfilled thus far. the annual meeting of the council takes place at the beginning of the new president's term of office, a day or two after the new council members have been elected. the agenda is a full one, with enough questions calling for immediate decision to leave little time or energy for leisurely discussion of long range policy problems. the board members tend to be the more active participants in the discussion, because they are more familiar with the issues than those who are not board members. it can be argued, of course, that if affairs are running smoothly without intense council activity, as they appear to be, there is no point in looking for more work for the council just to keep them busy. also, a group with around 30 members is of an awkward size for some types of work and deliberation. the council can meet at other times and can be polled by mail, so that it stands ready when any important policy matter arises. on the other hand, since the council is our policy making body, our most representative body, and the body on which nominees from other societies will see us in action, there is a strong case for trying to make it more continuously effective. there are several techniques that would be worth experimentation, and the board has been considering a plan of action. i am sorry that during my term of office i did not make a beginning. the present structure of the association as indicated previously, the wording of the 1948 constitution suggests that the asa would assume a more definitely central role in statistics by establishing, through association, links with other societies which recognized this role for the asa. section committees were apparently regarded as more of an interim mechanism, since the constitution describes them as applicable to ""fields not adequately covered at present by associated or affiliated societies"" and regards them as a means for organizing an associated society. as events have turned out, the formation of sections and section committees has been the predominant feature in the development of the asa during the past five years, while only a bare beginning has been made in linking ourselves with other societies. this has been a sound order of procedure, in that we have been working hard to try to serve the whole range of statistics, before putting forward claims that we are able to do so. it now looks as if many of our most important activities during the next few years will be in the hands of the sections. i hope that members of section committees will realize how important these committees have become. their useful activity is by no means confined to helping with the program at the annual meetings, but may include the planning of more specialized meetings, contributions to the publication program of the asa and factual studies of problems that confront the content fields. as the sections become larger and better established, what will be the next step in the evolution of the asa? in particular, what will happen if a section develops into associated society or if a society already in existence in the field of the section becomes associated with us? i do not know the answer, but some recent experiences of the biometrics section are worth noting. after the north regions of the biometric society had been established, the members of the biometrics section began a lively discussion of the future of this section. some members contended that the biometrics section should be dissolved. they claimed that the new regions of the biometric society could take care of the welfare of biometry in this country, that their administration would to a large extent be in the hands of asa members anyway, and that continuation of the biometrics section would be an unnecessary duplication of effort. an opposing view was that for a statistician, membership in the biometric society serves a different purpose from membership in the biometrics section. at present, about half the members of the biometric society are biologists. if this society is to flourish in its original objectives, it must continue to attract to membership a large number, preferably a majority, of biologists who would not join any statistical association. thus the biometric society gives the statistician the opportunity to talk with biologists, learning their problems, working with them, and presenting new techniques for criticism and use. the asa, on the other hand, is the place where statisticians in biometry can talk with statisticians in other content fields, both to find out what new techniques have developed in these fields and to present new ideas in biometry. from this point of view there was a strong argument for continuing the biometrics section as a nucleus for attracting future biometricians into the asa, for cooperating with other sections and for organizing programs on new or recent discoveries, where the technical level would be too high for most biologists. after much debate, the decision was taken to continue the biometrics section. i do not claim that it was the argument given above which carried the day. biometricians, like other statisticians, are fond of nice logical distinctions, and each tends to put forward a slightly different reason for advocating the same decision, and to attach great importance to the superiority of his reason over anyone else's, even though to an outsider the reasons are practically indistinguishable. but i hope that the argument will not be overlooked if other sections blossom into full societies and their members are uncertain whether to continue the section. if this concept of the purpose of a section is sound, the greatest benefit will be obtained from the present asa structure only if there is sustained cooperation among sections and if members make a habit of attending sessions of several different sections. there is, of course, nothing to prevent a member from belonging to every section. if the opposing view prevails, and if we are to look forward to seeing the sections disband one by one as associated societies are formed (as might happen if there is a general lack of interest in continuing the sections) then the structure of the asa will evolve towards something different. a conservative might comment that it would then resemble either a jellyfish or an octopus, depending on how one looks at it. more seriously, i do not mean to suggest that sections should be kept alive if there is no intrinsic life in them. we should, however, have to reexamine the whole problem of the best type of structure for the asa under the changed conditions. actually, some types of organization that did not involve sections at all were examined in the initial work for the 1948 constitution, but were rejected as being unsuitable in our present state of growth. some questions concerning the vitality of the association to consider our present structure from a slightly different point of view, i would now like to pose a few broad questions which bear upon what might be called the state of health of the association. can the asa maintain the enthusiastic support of its members? any large and heterogeneous society is likely to find that it is nobody's darling, because the affections of the members are accorded to some smaller and more homogeneous group in which they feel more at home. as the association grows larger in its new role, it may be more difficult to give the members a real sense of participation. the journal and the statistician, as the most tangible benefits from membership, have an important part to play, and it is currently planned to supplement these periodicals from time to time with special monographs and other publications of interest to the members. meetings of a local or regional character are a beneficial addition to our annual meetings as a means of bringing together more of our members. our chapters and sections may accomplish much in giving members a more immediate focus for their interests. continued joint activity by different sections will avoid a partitioning into self contained groups that has occurred in some societies. in addition, i hope that members will continue to agree that statistics needs an all embracing society, and will appreciate that the association will inevitably become more diffuse as it succeeds in adopting this role. can the asa continue to recruit young members? it is relatively painless for them to enter into membership: students pay only half the regular dues, as do also members under 30 during their first year. the office conducts a continuing campaign to spread information about membership, the groups approached being varied from year to year. as in other societies, our office finds that nothing succeeds so well as a personal approach from a present member, so that it is to our members and to the quality of our publications that we must look mainly for a steady recruitment of young persons. does the structure of the asa encourage younger members, as they mature, to participate in the running of the asa? since the rapid growth of statistics is recent, we suffer relatively little from government by the grey haired. nevertheless, many of our most experienced members are heavily burdened with activities on behalf of scientific societies. for this reason, as well as to keep us supplied with fresh points of view, the talents of younger members should be utilized to the fullest extent. the chapters and the section and district committees provide the first opportunity for younger members to undertake responsible tasks. for service at the national level on the councilor board, the problem of introducing new blood is more difficult. in the elections, which are by majority vote, my impression is that the candidate who is more widely known (and usually older) is very frequently the winner. something can be done about this problem both by the committee on elections when they nominate candidates and by the president when he appoints committees. is the asa able to stimulate new developments in statistics? some members have expressed the opinion that in the thirties and early forties the asa missed an opportunity by not playing a more prominent part in the developments which led to the formation of a number of other societies with statistical interests. i am not sure that i would agree. in the biometric society, which we did help to establish, i have been slightly disturbed in case the statisticians should play too prominent a role relative to the biologists. in founding this kind of a society, there is something to be said for leaving much of the initiative to the scientists in the subject matter field, who would not in general be members of the asa. nevertheless, our assumption of the role of a central organization with very wide interests does carry more responsibility for helping such developments, rather than leaving them to take place outside the asa. here again we must rely mainly on the section committees, particularly when they arrange programs, to be on the lookout for new developments. inspection of the wide range of our programs in recent years suggests that the committees have been lively and enterprising in this respect. the board and council and the office can also help. for a time, the board felt impelled to adopt a cautious policy owing to our financial difficulties, but fortunately these appear to be well out of the way. is the asaable to exercise leadership for statistics as a wholeso far as the use of statistics in government is concerned, our leadership is recognized as a result of a long history of disinterested service to agencies of the government. i believe that international statistical agencies would also join in this recognition. how do we stand in other areas involving statistical interests? are we active enough in exercising leadership? these questions are more troublesome. two areas that have always been of deep concern to the council and board are that involving relations with the public and that involving statistical standards. a piece of sound and important statistical work may be subjected to unjustified public attack, or a piece of shoddy and unscrupulous work, masking as statistically sound, may threaten to bring discredit on the profession. should such circumstances arise, i imagine that most members would expect the association to take corrective action. the problem of doing this effectively raises numerous difficulties. the critical moment for taking action may not be clear: there may be varying opinions about the most appropriate type of action; and the pressure of time may prevent thorough study of the issue before something must be done. for these reasons i am doubtful whether reliance on any standby body, such as the council or some designated committee, will be adequate. the analogy with a fire brigade is not good, because nobody rings the alarm bell to tell us when to spring into action. the council and board have been struggling to consider what program of study might be initiated in order to establish a set of principles and a mode of action for dealing with such emergencies so that we will not be caught unawares. this is a task that needs all the help that members can give. for many of the problems it seems clear that to be fully effective, the asa must work along with other societies that have statistical interests. consequently, a program of this kind may be one means of drawing us closer to these societies. finally, any account of our present structure must recognize that we are a voluntary organization. apart from a tiny office staff, everything that we do depends on the voluntary labor of the members. the association can become what the members want it to be: there is no entrenched bureaucracy to impose its own pattern. any member with a bright idea will receive an interested hearing (although he may sometimes have to talk a little loudly in order to do so). if his idea is bright enough, he will very likely find himself asked to carry it out as an enterprise of the association. secondly, we are a scientific as distinct from a professional society, in the sense that the association has always worked for the highest statistical standards rather than for the economic interests of its members. as we grow larger, it may be harder to retain this voluntary, scientific character while representing effectively the whole range of statistical activities. for my part, i hope that we can do both. to summarize, the asa is in a difficult period of growth in trying to keep up with an extraordinary expansion of statistics which scarcely anyone could have predicted accurately. in particular, the increasing specialization within statistics has set up forces which tend to decrease the amount of common interest amongst members and to split them into separate groups. the task of serving all areas of application in this rapidly changing environment will require us to be wide awake, adaptable, and receptive to new ideas and new ventures. my own appraisal would be that during the past five years our association has made gratifying progress, especially in view of the financial stringencies which inflation imposed upon us. some of the provisions of the 1948 constitution have had only modest effects as yet, but these provisions have not proved harmful: they create mechanisms that will increase our flexibility in adapting ourselves to the future growth of the field of statistics. although much remains to be done, i believe that we now have an organizational pattern that at least for the near future will enable us to take full advantage of our broad, common interests while giving scope also to our more specialized interests.",201,23.9601990049751,4.96034053156146,0.243355481727575,4816,1172,18.2406487082858,13.2406487082858,52,4.98317521393174,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1954.10501211"
1954,"49th","Marshall, Herbert","Male","Dominion Bureau of Statistics Canada","Government","114th","September 10–13, 1954","Montreal, PQ, Canada",NA,"Canada-Northern Neighbor",1954-09-11,"Herbert Marshall","1940-1969","the subject of my address is ""canada, northern neighbor."" since,recently, there has been an intensification of interest in canada on the part of your countrymen, i came to the conclusion that the subject i have chosen might have a more general appeal than any other i might select. canadians in recent years have been exercising their critical faculty on the broader aspects of national identity and characteristics. some have wondered if we really have developed a national consciousness, others have described us as ""living under the tyranny of the sunday suit,"" as conservative, self conscious, lacking self confidence. one, perhaps with tongue in cheek, for he has been termed canada's literary gadfly, declares we possess traits of infantilism in our national life. we took heart, however, from a later critic who advanced us to the stage of adolescence. if canada has reached her present status while still no more than adolescent, surely we may have hopes for a satisfactory maturity! of late there have been great happenings in canada; spectacular discoveries in natural resources and industrial developments with important implications for both the united states and canada which could not fail to draw attention to the affairs of the northern neighbor. canada possesses more square miles of territory than' any other nation save the union of socialist soviet republics and china. its area is 3,846,000 square miles but a mere statement of superficial area can be misleading. the vast open spaces of canada have not seldom attracted the envious gaze of nations whose population requires more space. in canada as a whole there are fewer than four persons per square mile of territory which compares with over fifty in the u.s.a. the yukon and northwest territories, not yet organized into provinces, which comprise over million square miles or 39% of the surface of canada, had only 25,000 population in 1951. it is the nature of these sparsely settled areas and the northern parts of the canadian provinces which accounts for the low population density of the dominion as a whole. an outstanding physical feature of this country is the canadian shield which has had and will continue to have a profound influence on our development. it is a huge u shaped area of precambrian rock, interspersed with sedimentary and volcanic intrusions, comprising 1,800,000 square miles or 45% of our total territory. it surrounds the great inland sea known as hudson bay and extends from the coast of labrador on the atlantic, to the interior plains of the prairie provinces, and at one point stretches down to the thousand islands in the st. lawrence river. at its top it is 1,900 miles across. it covers most of quebec, a very large though somewhat smaller portion of ontario, three fifths of manitoba, one third of saskatchewan, the northeast corner of alberta, approximately one half of the northwest territories and thrusts up in places into the arctic islands. the canadian shield is not suited for agriculture except in scattered pockets. if it had been our population would be much larger than it is. it is a treasure trove of mineral wealth; its rushing livers are a source of electric power; it has vast forested areas, the source of pulp and paper and lumbering industries, and contains many fur bearing animals; the natural beauty of its scenery, its lakes and rivers, many of which abound in fish, are a tourist attraction with great drawing power. if the canadian shield is 45% of our territory, what of the other 55%? time does not permit of a detailed description of the other regions. in broad outline it may be said that the south eastern part of the province of quebec, the three maritime provinces, nova scotia, new brunswick, and prince edward island, and newfoundland are in the appalachian region. therefore that area is cut up by mountain ranges which limit the amount of arable land. there is no coastal plain but there is the submerged grand banks, one of the great fishing areas of the world. in the central provinces, quebec and ontario, the region of heavy settlement is narrow because the canadian shield reaches far to the south. the total area of these two provinces is over one million square miles. a section to the south along the lower great lakes and the upper st. lawrence, including the niagara peninsula, comprising about 50,000 square miles, is known as the st. lawrence lowlands. it contains between one half and two thirds of the population of canada and is the industrial heart of the dominion. from the western limit of this section, that is, from lake huron westward, there is a stretch of a thousand miles before the continental plain is reached. that thousand miles is occupied by the southward thrust of the canadian shield and has been a great barrier to east west communication. even to day canadians motoring, say, from montreal to vancouver, avoid this stretch by going in transit through the united states. work is progressing on a trans canada highway. in the course of a rail journey through this region the passenger vill iook out upon hundreds of miles of wilderness with only occasional centres of settlement. the continental plain occupies the greatest portion of the prairie provinces, that is, the area not taken up by the canadian shield. it has deep arable soil from which the bulk of canada's grain is produced. but these provinces, especially alberta, have come into the limelight recently because of oil and gas discoveries. in the extreme west is the cordilleran region, here high mountain ranges are interspersed with valleys where mixed agriculture and fruit growing are important. other basic industries are mining, lumbering, and fishing. north of the prairie provinces and stretching to the arctic ocean lie the yukon and northwest territories. this huge area presents a variety of physical conditions; treeless plains in the far north; the rolling hills of the canadian shield; the forested valley of the mackenzie river. water resources vary from small streams and lakes to the largest rivers in canada, the mackenzie and yukon, both over 2,000 miles in length, and great slave and great bear lakes, each of which is 11,000 square miles. canada obviously is a land with a difficult topography. there is no possibility of continuous settlement throughout all its regions. at present canadians are concentrated in a line some 4,000 miles long with thinly populated sections intervening and the great bulk live within 200 or 300 miles of the border. canada also has difficult climatical conditions characterized by hot summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. the climate of southern british columbia is an exception resembling to some extent that of england. northern canada, of course, has arctic conditions and no sections of canada have a climate corresponding to that of southern europe. we have survived and developed as a nation, not only in spite of topography, geography and climate, but in spite of other influences which might have caused another story to be written. in 1760, when wolfe won his victory on the plains of abraham, this upper part of north america passed into the hands of britain. the policy adopted towards the french inhabitants shortly after was important for our future. they were granted full freedom of worship, speech, and customs. this was probably an important reason why they did not favor joining the newly formed united states after 1776 despite the fact that the colonies of british north america were small, isolated and relatively weak. this decision to remain in the british orbit created a refuge for those in the new republic who had opposed the revolution, and we had an influx of what have been called united empire loyalists who have contributed much to the development of canada. thus, in the very early stage of our history, our big neighbor has strongly influenced our development. naturally the united states has continued to influence us in many ways. most of this influence has been good and benign but it has not been invariably so. there were the border skirmishes of 1812 and raids at later dates. there was the threat of your westward surge and the doctrine of manifest destiny. but these events spurred canadians to accomplish what to some seemed impossible in order to preserve the nation. the first was the achievement of confederation by which, in the face of much opposition, four provinces entered the federation. these were nova scotia, new brunswick, quebec and ontario, the two last having been upper and lower canada previously. this was in 1867, and in 1872 prince edward island joined. away on the pacific coast was another colony british columbia. between the settled parts of ontario and british columbia stretched a practically empty country for two thousand miles, including what was to become the great grain growing provinces of the prairies. british columbia's condition for entering confederation was the building of a railway across these empty spaces. through miles of precambrian rock, through regions that seemed to be more water than land, across the prairies and through the three ranges of the rocky mountains the railroad was pushed and the first train reached vancouver in 1886. thus canada became bound together by a thin line of steel it was many years afterwards that the great open spaces of the prairies really began to fill up with people instead of herds of buffalo. the survival of canada as a nation, in spite of its handicaps in topography, geography, and climate and in spite of the siren allurements of your prosperity, your big markets, and sometimes your pressures, is one reason why historians declaim on the ""miracle of canada."" there are others. to create a separate nation we had to force our economy to a large extent into an east west development, whereas, according to nature in some sections at least, it should be north south. this is particularly true of the extremely west and east provinces. canadian destiny, of course, has been influenced by two great powers, great britain as well as the united states. canada, like the united states, has a federal organization but, apart from the federal aspect, canadian constitutional practice is modelled closely on the british parliamentary system. ours is the parliamentary cabinet system of government. the cabinet, headed by the prime minister, brings in most of the legislation and can, except in very unusual circumstances, count on the support of the members of the party. we have a senate in which members are appointed by the government for life. it is very different from the u.s. senate. in fact, it plays a minor role in the affairs of the nation. these and other basic institutions including our judicial system we have inherited from the united kingdom. it is our belief that they give soundness and stability to our country, which make it attractive and safe for other countries to invest in. there are no obstacles to bringing capital in or taking it out. canada, a member of the british commonwealth of nations, has equality of status with the united kingdom in all her domestic and foreign affairs. canada is a sovereign autonomous state. some of my acquaintances in the united states have been surprised and almost skeptical when i told them we pay no taxes to the united kingdom. our full hearted allegiance to england's queen as queen of canada carries with it no recognition of england's government as our government. the concept of a queen of the commonwealth seems to many to connote some financial obligation. doubtless the fact that queen elizabeth is queen of canada, and queen of each commonwealth nation,' as well as queen of the united kingdom, is something of a puzzle to those not directly concerned with the evolution of this political achievement. it has even been suggested that the queen might live part of the time in the capital of each of the commonwealth nations. in this connection, i quote from professor lower's book ""canada: nation and neighbor"" the british empire of the last century, which was both empire of domination and empire of settlement, began to change its nature as canada grew to maturity. the history of canada's relation with great britain is not only the history of self government of a colony of settlement but it is also the history of the reshaping of imperial institutions to reconcile them with self government. canada was determined to have the fullest measure of self government; she was also determined to have it without disrupting her association with the mother country. the result was the change, so frequently described ""from empire to commonwealth."" canada may not unfairly claim to have been the principal architect of the british commonwealth. at the end of nearly a century of existence as a nation canadians have some justification for pride in their achievements. the accomplishments of the past and the scope and magnitude of post war developments have aroused high hopes for the future. canadians believe that canada has a rendezvous with destiny. from 1946 to 1953 canada has had an outstanding period of development. our net gain in population during the period was more than 2! million. new investments in fixed capital were over 30 billion dollars. from 1946 to 1953 twenty one percent of our gross national product went into capital investment. though capital expansion commenced immediately after world war ii for reequipment, reconversion and modernization, needs for which had accumulated during the war economy and to some extent in the thirties, it soon went beyond the stage of catching up. new developments were bursting out in all directions. there were great projects for the utilization of resources including power, minerals, and wood products; the discovery of major oil fields in the west; the mechanization of agriculture which amounted to a revolution in farming methods and expansion in various lines of manufacturing. canada's development as an urban and industrial economy is evident in the fact that in 1900, 40 percent of her labour force was engaged in agriculture. in 1946 the proportion was 25%, in 1953 it was 16%. along with this high rate of economic activity and expanded productive capacity, there has gone a considerable rise in the standard of living. the production of goods and services the gross national product has increased after correction for price changes by one third from 1946 to 1953. in the united states the increase was 29%. canadians enjoy a material standard of living second only to that of the united states. an outstanding aspect of our recent progress is the development of natural resources. it is almost certain that we shall eventually be self supporting in oil on balance. pipe lines have been constructed which take the oil to the pacific coast and to eastern canada markets. at the same time tremendous supplies of natural gas have been developed. a 2200 inile all canadian pipe line is to be constructed from alberta to deliver natural gas to ontario and quebec. this, it is claimed, will be the greatest installation of its kind in the world. production of natural gas has risen from 48 billion cubic feet in 1946 to 101 billion in 1953. disposable reserves are estimated to be over 15 trillion cubic feet. these developments are altering profoundly the prairie economies. the three prairie provinces, situated in the west half of canada, have been predominantly agricultural though not entirely so. gas and oil are bringing diversification not only as primary materials but in alberta have given rise to an important development in petro chemical industries. what is happening in our prairie provinces is only one example of the important developments which have been taking place across canada and in our far northern areas. they have been the subject of many articles in periodicals some of which i am sure you have seen. the facts of canada's growth and development are so many and varied that there can be no doubt about them. but what of the future? far be it from me to don the robe of the prophet. however, it might be useful at this point to summarize some of the facts on which the future will be built and on which we base our hopes. first, there is the fact of our natural resources. our forests, farm, fishing and trapping industries with research and planning can be organized on a perpetual yield basis. sustained yield logging and improved silviculture techniques in our forests, improved methods of cultivation and new strains in cereals, restocking of fishing waters, conservation of wild life and general emphasis on conservation could ensure the use of these resources in perpetuity. as to foodstuffs, we shall continue to be an exporter of high quality wheat and other grains, and of the products of our fisheries but as population increases there will be less of other foods to export. stored in the canadian shield are the raw materials of many metals which are an indispensable foundation for our machine age. the developments in the precambrian rock of this shield with its many intrusions already have been spectacular, and much of this area is practically unexplored. it would be amazing if the future does not bring many more discoveries just as spectacular. the paley report says ""the united states has crossed the great industrial divide and from being a nation with a surplus of raw materials has become a deficit nation."" if what this report says is true, the united states will be increasingly interested as time passesin the riches of the canadian shield and in other mineralized areas of canada. there is an important corollary to the discovery of new mineral areas. the opening of the iron mines of labrador quebec included the building of 360 miles of railway. the new mining town at lynn lake in northern manitoba involved the building of a railroad of 155 miles. all such developments mean a further opening up of the northern areas. great reserves of lead and zinc have been discovered at pine point on great slave lake, which is 800 miles from the international border. eventually this territory also is likely to be reached by railroad. so the east west development of canada is now being supplemented by one in depth. these resources of the forest and mine are not a sufficient basis for confidence in the future in themselves. we would be condemned to be hewers of wood and drawers of water for more fortunately situated countries if we did not possess another indispensable resource for a country with ambition to become highly industrialized; that is, abundant supplies of energy. low cost hydro electric power has been fundamental in the development of our industries. for example, in our pulp and paper industry a combination of forest resources, rushing streams to carry down the logs and furnish hydro electric power, has given us a leading position. the only reason we can have an aluminum industry is the existence of abundant low cost hydro electric power. kitimat is an excellent example. our metallurgical and electro chemical industries are dependent on this same source of energy. our supply of power has increased steadily. the present turbine installation of 15 million horse power represents less than a quarter of our economic potential of nearly 66 million. this does not include the potential at the grand falls on the hamilton river in the quebec labrador iron ore area. new developments are tending to make it practicable to transmit power economically over much larger distances, and the harnessing of this great falls is under discussion. the potential is estimated as of the order of 10 million horse power. it is almost impossible to keep up to date in these developments. only recently it has been announced that preliminary talks were under way to promote a canadian plan for a giant hydro electric development which would harness the yukon river and provide for a new industrial area in the far northwest. full utilization of the water flow available in the yukon and northern british columbia could, eventually, produce 4 to 5 million horse power. but hydro electric power may not be enough for our future needs even when augmented by that from the st. lawrence waterways and other developments. it could be supplemented by the coal of the maritimes, the prairies, and british columbia, by the oil and gas carried by pipe lines from the prairies, and eventually by the use of atomic energy from the uranium of which canada is a leading producer. the fact is that canada is in the process of being bound together by a veritable network of equipment for the transmission of power sources hydro electric transmission lines, oil and gas pipe lines. more than natural resources and power is necessary for the successful development of the canada of the future. we need more population; but even there we are making progress. our population has been increasing in recent years at a rate of about 2!% per annum and is now over 15,000,000.it is a very pessimistic person in canada who does not visualize a population of between two or three times our present one at the end of the century. taking current birth and death rates and current net immigration and assuming they continue at the same rates, we would have a population of 18 or 19 million in 1961, 22! million in 1971. of course, also, the growth and development of canada will continue to require a vast amount of capital investment. oil and gas can be discovered and brought to the surface, mines developed, industries built up, pipe lines and railroads constructed, towns erected, only with the aid of capital. these investments in their development and subsequent operation provide the work opportunities for a growing population. have we good reasons for thinking the capital will be forthcoming to build the future canada? let us look at the record. while canadians have financed by far the largest part of post war investment, nonresident capital has been an important source of financing some major developments in recent years. at present other nations have $11.2 billion worth of capital invested in canada. of this amount $8.6 billion is owned in the united states compared with $4.1 billion in 1939. from 1945 to 1953 the united states increased its investments in canada by $3.6 billion. s have $3.6 billion of portfolio investments in canada which pay interest or dividends but involve no control of the enterprise. direct investments amount to $5 billion which are wholly owned or in which there is majority control in the united states. these direct investments in branch plants or subsidiary or controlled organizations are another instance of the benefits which our neighbor has bestowed on canada. they have accelerated the pace of development of our natural resources and hastened our industrialization. they are advantageous from our point of view because when in operation in many cases they supply the means of repayment. a mine or pulp and paper mill produces commodities which can be exported to the united states. also, successful direct investments usually mean a ploughing back of profits in the canadian branch or subsidiary. it is a permanent type of investment and multiplies. such operations reduce the net demand for u.s. dollars on the part of the canadian economy and, therefore, relieve strains on our balance of payments. one of the greatest benefits, of course, is that along with the creation of the branch plant or subsidiary come the technical skills and knowledge accumulated through years of experience by the parent concern. canada, therefore, has welcomed these large capital investments, and their welcome has been all the heartier because there has been a growing tendency to train and bring canadians into the management and also to permit canadians to participate in the financing. on the whole these branches have adapted themselves to the canadian atmosphere and have respected canadian aims and cooperated in their attainment. except in name, in actual operation they are scarcely distinguishable from canadian concerns. of course, i would not have you think that this large financial interest in canada means that your countrymen own the bulk of it. even in the four industries in which capital is mostly concentrated manufacturing, mining and smelting, petroleum exploration and development, and public utilities, canadian ownership increased from 62% in 1939 to 68% in 1951, and the proportion owned by canadians of all the national wealth is very much greater than this. all things considered, lack of capital should not be an obstacle to the growth of canada. in fact, canada is not now heavily dependent on outside sources for capital. approximately 80% of the post war expansion was financed by canadians. our ability to keep our trade, not only commodity but also invisible items such as interest, dividends, tourist trade, and a host of others in balance, is another factor on which future development will depend. this problem, of course, is known technically as the balance of international payments. during the year 1953 the debits in our current account with the united states exceeded our credits by $924 million. we had a credit balance with all other countries of $485 million which gave us an overall debit of $439 million. failing any other source of meeting this adverse balance, it would have been necessary to draw on our national reserve of united states dollars. but the change in this reserve was not significant. the explanation of that phenomenon is the flow of united states and other funds into canada for investment, which offset the adverse balance on current account and created such a demand for canadian dollars that the latter has been at a premium over the united states dollar. suppose, however, there was a slowing up of this capital investment, what would be the situation if a large deficit remained in our current account? is it to be expected that year after year this huge investment of capital by united states corporations and individuals will continue without at least periods of slowing up? this brings us face to face with the question of trade relationships. exports are the life blood of the canadian economy. the products of our farms, mines, forests, and fisheries are far beyond the capacity of our small population to consume. the importance of foreign trade is evident in the fact that in 1953 we ranked third in both exports and imports among the trading nations of the world, surpassed only by the u.s.a. and u.k. in view of the importance of foreign trade to canada, our government, throughout the post war period, has worked for the reduction of existing barriers to international trade. canada is one of the few countries in the world which has almost no significant barriers to imports other than tariffs, and the canadian tariff has been reduced considerably since the war. incidentally, canada has never received directly one dollar of lend lease or marshall plan aid. instead, she has contributed substantially in mutual aid, loans and other forms of international assistance like the colombo plan. our needs have set canada in the very forefront of international efforts for freer trade. this policy has been pursued in the face of discouraging obstacles. many of the obstructions to overseas trade were created by the imposition of quotas and embargoes so that the mutual tariff concessions negotiated in the general agreement on tariffs and trade have yielded little benefit to canada. canada has lived up to the agreements but overseas countries could not because with them tariff was not the difficulty but the fact that they were short of dollars. the united states adoption of the reciprocal trade agreement program and some other supporting developments, such as the original sponsoring of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, were landmarks in this field. recently, however, progress has been retarded, and in certain cases there has even been a movement in reverse. there has been disappointment that simplification of your customs procedures, particularly in respect to the system of classification and valuation, has not progressed much farther than is the case. resumption of the discussions next spring of these trade barriers, in many cases more protective than tariffs, will be followed here and abroad with keen interest. in spite of barriers of which we wish there were fewer, there is an enormous flow of goods across the border. the united states is our best customer. in 1953, 59% of our exports were to the u.s.a. the other side of the picture is that we are a very good customer since we purchased 73.5% of our imports from your country in 1953. in monetary terms our exports to the united states amounted to approximately $2! billion and our imports from the united states to approximately $31 billion. since the war we have imported annually, on the average, over $500 million worth of goods more than we have sold to your country. incidentally, 56% of our exports to the united states in 1953 were raw or partly manufactured materials. the other 44%, i.e., fully processed materials and finished goods includes the important item, newsprint, in which the value added by manufacture is low. on the other hand, 84% of our imports from the united states were fully processed materials and finished goods. how does this trade situation affect our hopes for the future? there are a number of factors which will have a bearing on it. first, the question of trade is, of course, part of the wider subject the balance of international payment. when one nation invests heavily in another, a large part of the investment usually takes the form of a flow of commodities. if the investment diminishes, the commodity flow lessens. thus the adverse balance of trade on the receiving end would be reduced. second, hopes are rising that those countries which have been short of dollars are nearing the stage where convertibility of currencies will be achieved a necessary basis for freer world trade. third, a great deal of the development which has been going on in canada has yet to reach the production stage. its fruition should affect our trade picture markedly. it is difficult to be pessimistic about the future of canadian trade when one thinks of the aluminum which is to come out of kitimat, the iron ore from ungava, the higher production of nickel and other non ferrous metals from numerous new mines, titanium from the allard lake region when the process is working commercially, and the possibility of another new metallurgical colossus in the northwest through the harnessing of the mighty yukon. canadians look to the development of the st. lawrence waterways as another means of strengthening their economic position. there will be, of course, increased offsets to earnings from exports by transfers of profits on u.s. capital investments, but, at the same time, a number of developments will diminish our need for imports. we shall arrive at self sufficiency in oil, and gas flowing through the trans canada gas pipe line to the east will replace some imported coal. the growth of our population will mean a reduction in the amount of foodstuffs we shall have for export. on the other hand, canadian growth and development and our rapidly expanding economy will produce opportunities for the domestic production of manufactured or semi manufactured goods which have been imported in the past. this is true already in our domestic iron and steel industry and in a variety of chemical products. (it is interesting to note that in the period 1926 1929 exports of goods and services from canada accounted for some 29% of gross national expenditure, in 1936 39 the proportion was about 28%, and in 1950 53 about 23%. the growth in canada's population and the domestic market seems slowly to be reducing the proportion of canada's resources devoted to direct production for the foreign market.) nevertheless, trade could be our achilles heel. canada is dependent on foreign trade to a much greater extent than the united states with its huge domestic market. canada will thrive more than most nations in an era of peace and growing prosperity. in a depressed economic climate or dollar shortage she will have her problems. with sanity and vision on the part of labour and management in relation to costs; given a world in which the forces of peace gain the upper hand and in which progress towards the ideal of raising world standards of living can be made, the economic future of canada surely should be very bright. some of the lesser developed nations surpass canada in resources of some minerals, or in forest areas, or in power potentials. canada has no rival among them in the combination of mineral and forest resources, energy potentials, a belief in free enterprise, ,he stability of sound government, and a safe harbor for capital investment. canada undoubtedly has an impressive array of assets and i am sure the united states would like to see our country continue its progress so that this whole north continent may present the strongest front to authoritarian aggressiveness. man shall not live by bread alone. canada might have great material prosperity and yet be in danger of losing her own soul. at least, this is the warning which many eminent canadians have been voicing in recent years. our concern about cultural influences led to the appointment in 1949 of a royal commission on national development in the arts, letters and sciences which produced a masterly report. it has become known as the massey report after its chairman, who is now the first canadian to be governor general of the dominion. it emphasizes the fact that canada owes a great debt to the united states for the generous manner in which your cultural facilities have been made available to canadians. the gifts of the carnegie corporation and the rockefeller foundation; the aid of the guggenheim foundation and the association for the advancement of science to a host of students seeking opportunities for further study; the fellowships and scholarships awarded to canadian students in universities, tell a tale of magnificent generosity. moreover, our nearness to the united states and many similarities in our ways of life mean that a vast mass of other cultural media pour across the border. these include radio, films, newspapers, periodicals, books, and your touring musicians and artists. although in recent years canadian periodicals have strengthened their position greatly, they have had to face almost overwhelming competition. canadians read more periodicals than they do canadian, with the exception of local newspapers. all this influence, however, has not been an unmixed blessing for the development of canadian culture. educational opportunities made available to canadians has resulted in a loss of much talent since many students, when they finish their courses in institutions, accept positions in the united states and do not return to canada. perhaps we have been too dependent on generosity. the brief of the national conference of canadian universities to the royal commission commented "" generosity has blinded our eyes to our necessities. culturally we have feasted on the bounty of our neighbors, and then we ask plaintively what is wrong with our progress in the arts."" here i might mention that since the report of the royal commission was made public the dominion government has instituted a system of special grants to universities. in canada, as in the united states, the battle between the fundamentalist and progressivist philosophies of education has been joined. the need for more education in the humanities has been given increasing emphasis. quite recently hilda neatby, a professor in one of our canadian universities, wrote a book severely critical of the present situation. entitled ""so little for the mind"" it became a best seller in the non fiction field and has aroused a storm of discussion which may be the forerunner of reform. canadians, of course, can tune in on radio programs and have as their movie film diet mainly the hollywood output. many of your radio programs are superlative in character and afford immense enjoyment to numerous canadian listeners. there are other aspects of broadcasting which have been severely criticized in your own country. the massey report urged ""that in canada measures should be taken to avoid in our radio and t.v. at least those aspects of broadcasting which have provoked in the united states the most outspoken and the sharpest opposition."" our canadian broadcasting system is the result of recommendations made by a royal commission on radio, known as the aird commission appointed in 1928. the view has been accepted that radio is a public trust and not just another industry; its social influence is so great that for the welfare of its citizens government must take some responsibility in the matter of control. in the canadian broadcasting act of 1936 the canadian broadcasting corporation (c.b.c.) was created and given wide powers of control. broadcasting was to become a force fostering a national spirit and interpreting national citizenship. the c.b.c. policy is to concentrate canadian resources on the development of programs essentially canadian and to supplement them with the best available entertainment from other countries, which means mainly the united states. the c.b.c. exercises control by virtue of the fact that it recommends to the minister of transport the grant, renewal or cancellation of licenses to private operators. also, it can regulate the nature and amounts of advertising, political broadcasts, and generally, the character of all programs whether public or private. while, of course, there is room for improvement in the operations of c.b.c., the massey report states that it ""has opened the way to mutual knowledge and understanding which would have seemed impossible a few years before. canadians as a people have listened to news of their own country and of the world, have heard public topics discussed by national authorities, have listened. to and participated in discussions of canadian problems, and have, through radio, been present at great national events."" in short, c.b.c. has been of immense importance in developing our cultural identity. such is the system concerning radio in canada. since television also comes under the jurisdiction of the c.b.c., its development may be expected to follow the same pattern. time will not permit me to enlarge on this subject. while it is true that mediocre movies, the juke box, soap operas, comic papers, jazz and so on occupy too prominent a place in our cultural atmosphere, it is also true that there is a widespread and growing interest in music, drama, painting and the fine arts generally. in the last two summers there was a record breaking movement of visitors from all directions to witness the shakespearian drama festival at stratford, ontario. canadian artists have won acclaim abroad and canadian musical composers were thrilled recently by the success of the all canadian concert at carnegie hall under the leadership of leopold stokowski. as time passes canadians will make distinctive contributions to the culture of north america. in conclusion, we canadians do not wish to become a pale and insipid copy of the great people. we wish to have a distinctive canadian way of life which, while benefiting by your great qualities, will evolve also from a fusion of our own rich french, anglo saxon and other heritages, developed and refined in the crucible of canadian experience. we must think for ourselves and stand on our own feet. sometimes, therefore, we may have the temerity to disagree with you i with the fundamentals of your way of life there will be complete accord. the northern neighbor will be one with you in promoting and defending the freedoms which have been inherited and enhanced, and in all efforts to secure peace, goodwill, and higher standards of living for the human race.",318,20.9591194968553,4.89767441860465,0.264366091522881,6665,1762,16.4074024402327,11.4074024402327,17,1.47665574699114,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1955.10501248"

Watkins","1940-1969","﻿in the 1930's a french observer of the scene took notice, in an article in one of our national magazines, of the penchant of for statistics, the strong tendency to measure, to count, to give expression in numbers. this tendency he summed up in the amusing characterization that in statistics the has discovered a substitute for ideas, enabling him to dispense with both beauty and wisdom. for this audience, at the 115th annual meeting of the statistical association, perhaps the simplest response would be to adroit with pride the penchant for statistics, but with restrained if mock indignation to deny the amusing characterization as both libelous and naive in its lack of understanding of the nature and role of statistics in our society. the counter argument might proceed with a demonstration of some of the many elegant solutions to be found in our work and of the beauties inherent generally in statistical distributions and relationships, followed by the statistician's appeal to reason, in the choice of statistics and techniques, as well as in the analysis, interpretation, and synthesis of his statistical results the recognition that cerebration and balanced judgment must command at all stages: hypothesis, experiment, conclusion, synthesis. in perhaps the instance of greatest frequency in our craft, we would point out that choice of statistics in correlation analysis must rest on an antecedent hypothesis as to causation; and that causal explanations of demonstrated correlations must rest on causal theory. my purpose this evening, however, is not defense. rather, it is to review with you some of the solid progress that is behind us and to outline some of the promising trends that point the way ahead. in the first publication of the statistical association, published in boston in 1843, the publishing committee of the association deemed it a matter of propriety in its preface to ""call the attention of the public to a brief statement respecting the peculiar sphere and objects of their labors. for this purpose they avail themselves of the principal portions of an address put forth by the association at the period of its first establishment, in the year 1840; which was drawn up with much learning and ability, by rev. professor b. b. edwards [d.d.], of the andover theological seminary."" the quoted and endorsed address defined statistics to be ""the ascertaining and the bringing together of those facts, which are fitted to illustrate the condition and prospects of society,"" and stated that ""the object of statistical science is to consider the results which those facts produce, with the view to determine the principles upon which the well being of society depends."" the speaker properly noted the establishment of the statistical society of london six years earlier, ""in pursuance of a recommendation of the british association for the advancement of science,"" and quoted its prior definition of statistics, from which his definition differed only slightly, and cited the first number of the london society's journal. now these definitions of the association's founding fathers reflect the ""political arithmetic"" concept of statistics of that period and reveal no awareness of methodology or of the coming impact on statistics of the developments in the theory of probability. all of this is scarcely to be wondered at. quetelet, the belgian mathematician and astronomer turned statistician, who first fused ""political arithmetic"" and the calculus of probability, had got his training in probability under la place in paris not many years earlier. these definitions of our founding fathers seem far removed also from the concept of ""the measurement of the uncertainty of inductive conclusions,"" the unique feature of statistics discussed in professor snedecor's presidential address before this forum seven years ago; and far removed from the modern technical concepts represented in the titles to many of the papers at this present meeting of the association. there are, nevertheless, several aspects of these definitions of 115 years ago, which merit some notice as well as approbation. first, i would point out that our founders were concerned not merely with the measurement of the existing ""condition"" of society but gave recognition also to measurement of ""prospects,"" or trends or projections, as we might put it. any later tendencies on the part of statisticians toward concentration on a backward looking process cannot fairly be charged to the founding fathers. second, i would note that our founders were not concerned with statistics for statistics' sake but rather had a positive, purposeful, and scientific object in view, namely, ""to determine the principles upon which the well being of society depends."" our founders' dedication to purposeful statistics found reflection again in the association's second publication, issued in 1845, on the population of massachusetts for the years from the establishment of the colony up to the beginnings of the federal census. in a prefatory note the deficiencies of the data were duly noted setting a pattern from which there has been scant deviation by members of our craft since that time but the need for the information ""in this department of .. political economy"" was stressed; and in the closing words it was said of the publication that ""public usefulness is its primary object."" third, i would call attention to the early linkage of statistics to political economy. on the first page of this second publication, it was noted that ""the earliest history of nations shows, that they have ever regarded their inhabitants as of the first importance in the science of political economy."" and after a paragraph of discourse on population, emphasizing the young nation's abundant resources"" .. not only for the natural increase of our own people, but, also, for the multitudes, who annually throng to our shores,"" the paragraph closed with this observation in the field of political economy: ""it will be a pleasant sign in the knowledge of our republic, when writers, like smith and malthus, shall arise and be encouraged to publish their researches, speculations and conclusions."" here, then, we see in the beginnings and fundaments of our craft, the close linkage of statistics with economics of the ""political arithmetic"" of the day with the political economy of the day. presently i shall have more to say on that continued linkage to this day. despite this close linkage with political economy, it should be made clear that our founders recognized the all embracing scope of statistics. in the quoted and applauded words of dr. edwards in 1840, ""statistics are closely allied to the other sciences, and receive contributions from all of them."" the 18 sciences and fields enumerated in that address included geography, geology, agriculture, zoology, industry, commerce, botany, horticulture, chemistry, medicine, mechanics, meteorology, physiology, population, education, finance, government, and religion. our founding fathers staked out, i believe we can say, a sufficiently broad scope in terms of subject matter fields. perhaps we may add, with tongue in cheek, that we still have, 115 years later, ample lee way for the formation of sections i there is one further aspect of the association's beginnings i wish to call attention to, and that is the scientific detachment with which the founders approached the problem of recording the experiment with free political institutions. follow these words from the preface to the association's first publication: ""another advantage which may be expected to flow from statistical inquiries in this country has relation to our peculiar civil institutions. it is of the utmost importance that, while the experiment of free political institutions is in progress, all the facts pertaining to this experiment should be carefully gathered up and recorded. the whole process of the experiment should be accurately marked and faithfully described by competent observers, at the time, and on the spot. in this way if we succeed, it will be known why we succeed; if we fail, the causes of this failure will be apparent. thus we shall have faithful observations and unquestionable facts on which to rely, instead of being left to guess at the reasons, and substitute speculation in the place of certain knowledge. how inestimably precious would be a thorough statistical view of the ancient grecian republics, a view which should enter into all the details.... the ancient historians leave us in complete darkness in respect to a thousand interesting questions.... our course should be more intelligent and. benevolent. if we value our institutions, we should be able to show good grounds for our favorable estimate, not only in our actual prosperity, but by our recorded knowledge, by facts well ascertained, and philosophically classified. and this duty cannot be safely left to individuals. it is only by means of associated labor, that the proper results can be secured."" there is here, it seems to me, not only a clear reflection of the scientific spirit but a sense of destiny in the ring of those words, a sense of destiny reminiscent of the pen of alexander hamilton in 1787 in the federalist, no.1, writing of "" .. the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world,"" and observing that, ""it has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection or choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force."" before this forum in 1953, in his presidential address on the present structure of the association, professor cochran pointed out the great broadening of the association's activities into many subject matter fields, in contrast to the earlier history of concentration of the association in the fields of business and economic statistics. that broadening of scope into many fields is part and parcel of the development of the science of statistics; and has indeed been accompanied by increased penetration in depth in each of the several fields. likewise, this broadening process has brought with it tremendous gains, actual and potential, in the form of cross fertilization of fields, the transfer of statistical techniques from one subject matter field to another, the exchange of data and design; and in general has opened up great possibilities in inter disciplinary research. in a sense, this broadening is part of the process of growing up, of maturing. great advances have been made in statistical techniques and methodology; and as professor wilks noted in his presidential address in 1950, significant progress has been made in graduate and research training in both applied and theoretical statistics in numerous subject matter fields. stimulating and paralleling in a measure these advances and lines of progress, the association has come of age and has extended its scope and activities accordingly. this is a development that has immensely enriched each field embraced in the association's activities, and it is a development of which we can all feel proud. whatever loss has accrued in the field of business and economic statistics, from the cessation of concentration of association activities in that field, has been more than offset by the gains in depth and maturity in the field and by the gains from cross fertilization. my own interest and membership in the statistical association extend back about three decades, to the middle 1920's; and the strongest impression i have from those years of interest and membership is one of tremendous progress in the field of statistics, both applied and theoretical, and in the association's work, both in scope and in depth. that progress is part of the heritage we celebrate at this 115th annual meeting; and i believe the association may rightly claim a significant share of the credit for that progress. i am confident that the membership of the association generally joins me in the fervent hope that the association will continue over the years as the central scientific and professional society concerned with both applied and theoretical statistics; that it will be ever sensitive to the needs of the new or emerging interest groupings, as well as to the continuing needs of the established groupings; and that generous spirited and hospitable moves will always be made to welcome back to the central fold, by association, closer association, or otherwise, interest groupings that have drifted away. there is room in our central fold for all such groupings in the fields of applied and theoretical statistics; and it is in the mutual interest of all statisticians, and indeed in the interest of society, that we have a strong central association whose objects are, to quote from our constitution, "" .. to foster in the broadest manner statistics and its applications, to promote unity and effectiveness of effort among all concerned with statistical problems, and to increase the contribution of statistics to human welfare."" iii let us return to the subject of the close linkage of statistics with economics, or ""political arithmetic"" with political economy, if you wish. as stated earlier in these remarks, that historical linkage persists to this day, and will i believe continue, despite the broadening of scope in statistics and despite the broadening of the work of this association, a broadening we all applaud for the great gains it has brought to statistical science, to science generally, to society, and to the association. it is, i believe, a development of historic importance in the united states that the congressional joint committee on the economic report has with apparent earnestness assumed a leadership role in the field of business and economic statistics. although the joint committee's interest is naturally focused primarily on the statistical programs of the federal government, it is by no means restricted to such programs. rather, the committee's work makes clear that it intends, very properly in my judgment, to concern itself with the entire field of business and economic statistics, insofar as such programs, public or private, are helpful in furthering an understanding of the functioning of the economy and in facilitating the aims of public policy embraced explicitly or implicitly in the employment act of 1946, under which act the joint committee was established almost ten years ago. the logic of that interest is crystal clear, since without adequate statistical measures the economic report could neither be formulated by the president and his advisers nor reviewed and appraised by the joint committee. for the first time in the history of the country, there is a national public forum before which the adequacy of programs in business and economic statistics can be reviewed and appraised; and through which sound programs can be furthered. the pioneering work done in 1954 by the joint committee's subcommittee on economic statistics represented a salient contribution. the subcommittee's hearings and reports have helped bring about, i believe, a more intelligent understanding, in the nation generally as well as within the congress and the executive branch of the government, of the place that statistical programs occupy in the management of the economy and why we must have these statistical measures. again, the joint committee, through its subcommittee on economic statistics, has made history in 1954 and 1955 through the systematic reports on the status and adequacy of both public and private economic statistics in certain major areas, which reports by designated committees of statisticians and economists have been submitted to the joint committee under the aegis of the board of governors of the federal reserve system. these reports are, i believe, certain to exercise great influence in shaping statistical programs in these areas. moreover, they undoubtedly foreshadow similar efforts in the future by the joint committee in the exercise of its public review and stimulating functions in the field of economic statistics. it is particularly fitting that the statistical association take note of and applaud this assumption of a leadership role in the field of business and economic statistics by an arm of the congress. this association has long concerned itself with statistical leadership, coordination of statistical programs, and statistical standards; and with reference thereto has had a long and intimate relationship with the executive branch of the federal government. it was this association that established the committee on government statistics and information services in 1933, whose work led to the establishment of the central statistical board by executive order in 1933, and by statutory enactment in 1935. that board continued in existence until 1939 when its functions were placed in the bureau of the budget as the division (now office) of statistical standards. and it was a past president of this association, dr. frederick c. mills, of columbia university, and a present member of the council of the association, dr. clarence d. long, of johns hopkins university, who made a comprehensive review of federal statistical agencies for the first hoover commission and recommended, in part, as follows: that there be maintained in the executive office of the president an office of statistical standards and services having general responsibility for the development and maintenance of a system of statistical intelligence and for its economical management. it should have powers necessary to the full coordination of the elements of that system, and for the enforcement of desired procedures and appropriate standards. this office should discharge the present duties of the division of statistical standards, but should have scope for greater initiative and authority appropriate to a broader role. it will seek to insure the accuracy, representativeness, timeliness of publication, and comparability with other data of all statistical series serving public purposes. the work of this office should be largely confined to supervisory and staff functions, with a minimum of routine duties. its personnel should include men of the highest administrative and technical competence. the head of the office shall be appointed by the president. among other functions recommended was that of annually summarizing and coordinating the operating expenses and appropriation requests of statistical agencies and appraising them for the benefit of the bureau of the budget, the president, and the congress. similarly, it was recommended that the committees on appropriations of the house and senate and other congressional committees should request representatives of the office of statistical standards to testify before them concerning appropriations for statistical purposes and legislation involving statistical functions. for the full report, see the statistical agencies of the federal government: a report to the commission on organization of the executive branch of the government, national bureau of economic research, 1949. it is also this association that maintains, by invitation, an advisory committee on statistical standards to the bureau of the budget. the leadership role in economic and business statistics assumed by the joint committee on the economic report is a constructive development of great significance to the economy in general and to statistical programs in particular. it must at the same time be noted that the executive branch of the government will increasingly find itself in an anomalous position if it does not take steps to place the statistical coordinating and leadership functions on a plane commensurate with their importance in the management of the economy. those functions were outlined with intelligent comprehension, insight, and forward looking imagination by the first hoover commission task force (mills long) report i have cited. although that report is now almost seven years old, i believe a review by the executive branch of its proper role in statistical coordination and leadership may properly start with that report. iv the transformations that have taken place in the economy over the past quarter century and the profound shifts in our thinking that have occurred constitute, in my judgment, one of the great peaceful revolutions of history. it is now taken for granted that we are committed, as a people and as a government, to whatever public and private actions may be required to further our progress toward the companion goals of economic growth and economic stability. since the end of world war ii we have experienced two recessions, in 1948 49 and 1953 54, and our institutions successfully met the test of preventing those recessions from developing into vicious spirals of credit liquidation and major depression. that success was, i believe, no accident and affords renewed proof of the depth of the transformations we have achieved in our economy and in our thinking about the economy. the gain to our society represented by these transformations is of tremendous significance and is reflected in a pervasive spirit of confidence in our future. the principal point i wish to stress, however, is that these transformations in our economy and in our thinking could not have occurred if we had not had a great body of statistical measures of the condition and trends of the economy and skilled technicians to analyze those measures. the sound management of the economy is dependent on good statistical records and on good analysis; and this dependence extends throughout our society, in private business management as well as in the administration of public functions. both the level and the direction of change of the economy at any time are the resultants of the myriads of decisions being made every day by the spending and producing and governing units that make up that economy, including consumers, farmers, business men, labor leaders, professional practitioners, and public officials. each decision of that myriad of decisions must be based on information; and it is one of the monumental achievements of our society that the measured economic intelligence available to our people constitutes a network of statistical information unprecedented in scope and richness howsoever conscious we may be of weaknesses in many of its elements. we stress the dependence of good management on statistical records, but we are not unmindful of the limitations of our statistical measurements. these measurements of the condition of the economy can be only approximations, for that economy is too massive and too complex to afford any basis for claims to perfection or certainty in our economic measures. the estimates and indexes that are carefully prepared to measure the state of the economy, in terms of such concepts as gross national product, national income, industrial production, employment and unemployment, represent at any given time the best approximations the technicians can arrive at, on the basis of the information available to them at the time and on the basis of the extent of the analysis that time and funds permitted. these measures are not perfect, they cannot represent certainty; and the best we can claim is that they are reasonable approximations at the time and under the given circumstances. a corollary is that our statistical measurements of the state of the economy are subject to revision from time to time in the light of better information and on the basis of improved analysis. that process of revision and refinement is part and parcel of the beckoning goal of progress. despite all the limitations in our statistical measures of the economy and despite all the human frailties in economic and statistical analysis of these measures, the effective management of our economy, public and private, must in large part rest on them. and the contributions made to economic stability over the past quarter century by statistical and economic analysis represent gains which must be measured in terms of scores of billions of dollars annually. in social terms these gains may be described as the near universal conviction of our citizenship that ours is not only a viable economic system but one which in large measure achieves the twin goals of security and adventure, of stability and growth, of peaceful order and restless dynamism. here indeed is the stuff of progress, the mark of triumph. the evidence is clear to me that we have wrought transformations in the economy which, given reasonably competent management, make the economy depression proof, that is, in terms of devastating depressions like that of 1929 to 1933. through these transformations we have achieved in considerable measure an economic system of built in stability. the important point, however, is not that professional economists and statistical analysts of the business cycle believe that the transformations in the economy and in our thinking about the economy, of which i have spoken, make our economy depression proof against catastrophic depressions. the salient point, rather, is that both consumers and business men generally have come to believe that major depressions are unnecessary, that they can be avoided through competent public and private management, and that such avoidance is the first domestic responsibility of those who manage our affairs. that general conviction points up a truly sobering responsibility. the conviction that catastrophic depressions can be avoided does not at all imply a belief that economic recessions are a thing of the past. indeed, we can see that moderate economic fluctuations are part of the price of freedom. they are inherent in a free economy; inhere basically in that precious hallmark of a free society freedom of choice; freedom to buy or not to buy; freedom as to what to buy; freedom of occupation and freedom of entry into business; and freedom in the management of our far flung business system, composed of more than four million separate business concerns. the business cycle is still with us and will continue with us so long as we remain a free economy and a free society, though we may properly continue our efforts at lessening the amplitude of economic fluctuations and may well hope to achieve more and more progress as we learn more about the behavior of the economy and as our management skills are sharpened by experience. there can be no guarantee, however, against recurrent mild recessions and periods of readjustment like those of 1924, 1927, 1948 1949, and 1953 1954. but we can take those in our stride, precisely because we have learned how to ameliorate some of the consequences of such recessions at the same time that we have learned how to prevent their spiralling into massive credit liquidation and deep dyed depression. we may have to face the possibility of the recurrence, at some time in the future, of a recession like that of 1938 or even that of 1921; but i would say that any such contingency would be a sad reflection on both public and private management of our economy. moreover, if such a recession occurred i think it is safe to say that the administration in office at that time would lose the next national election, congressional or presidential. the consciousness of that threat, we may add, is surely a spur to remedial action. the chairman of the president's council of economic advisers has wisely observed recently that our economy is at all times subject to the threat of either inflation or recession; and that only through eternal vigilance and wise management of the economy can we hope to avert those threats. it is the role of economic statistics and quantitative economic analysis to supply the indispensable guides that watchful vigilance and good management require. it is a not inconsiderable role in the evolution of our society,",154,29.2272727272727,5.12952677182848,0.279937791601866,4501,1260,20.8956392518834,15.8956392518834,62,2.10334182082108,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1956.10501307"

Cox","1940-1969","i am going to ask you to look forward as we try to discern, as best we can, what the future holds for statisticians. if ten years ago we had predicted some of the things we are doing today, we would have been ridiculed. now, my concern is that we may become too conservative in our thinking. civilization is not threatened by atomic or hydrogen bombs; it is threatened by ourselves. we are surrounded with ever widening horizons of thought, which demand that we find better ways of analytical thinking. we must recognize that the observer is part of what he observes and that the thinker is part of what he thinks. we cannot passively observe the statistical universe as outsiders, for we are all in it. the statistical horizon looks bright. exciting experiences lie ahead for those young statisticians whose minds are equipped with knowledge and who have the capacity to think constructively, imaginatively, and accurately. will you, with me, look upon the statistical universe as containing three major continents: (1) descriptive methods, (2) design of experiments and investigations, and (3) analysis and theory. as we tour these continents, we shall visit briefly a few selected well developed countries, where statisticians have spent considerable time. as tourists, we shall have to stop sometimes to comment on the scenery, culture, politics, or the difficulties encountered in securing a visa. with our scientific backgrounds, we should spend most of our time seeking out the new, the underdeveloped, the unexplored or even the dangerous areas. it is one of the challenges of the statistical universe that, as new regions are discovered and developed, the horizon moves further away. we cannot visit all the frontiers for they are too numerous. i believe that we should try to visualize the challenges of the future by looking at typical types of unsolved problems. i hope you will find the trip so interesting that you will revisit some of these statistical frontiers not as tourists but as explorers. you know how many folders and guide books one can accumulate while traveling. i am not going even to list the ones used. this will leave you guessing whether i am quoting or using original ideas. many people in this audience will recognize their statements used with no indication that they are quotations. 2. descriptive methods continent in planning our tour, i decided to take you first to the descriptive methods continent, for it is the oldest and has the densest settlement. the lay conception of descriptive methods ordinarily includes these countries: (1) collection of data; (2) summarization of data including such states as tabulation, measures of central tendency and dispersion, index numbers and the description of time series; and (3) the presentation of data in textual, tabular, and graphic form. the collection of data is the largest country on this descriptive methods continent. this country is of common interest and concern to the whole statistical universe and is by far the oldest country. official statistics existed in the classic and medieval world. in fact, in 1500 b.c. in judea the population is given as 100,000 souls. practical necessity forced the earliest rulers to have some count of the number of people in their kingdom. the collection of official statistics has increased in importance over the years as evidenced by the large units of our federal government such as census, agriculture, and labor, organized to collect all kinds of useful data. before going into the frontier area to collect more data, one should check carefully the sources of data in the settled areas to be sure that he is not about to perform needless duplication. the decision will have to be made whether to take a census, or to take a sample from the population. here, as we stand on a ridge, we look over into the sampling country which we shall visit later. between the collection and the summarization of data countries, there is this border area, where the police (editors) check our schedule to make sure the blanks are filled and that no absurd or highly improbable entries have been made. as we continue our tour, our papers and passports will be checked frequently. our first stop in the summarization country is at the state called tabulation. here the data on all items from the individual schedules are tabulated and cross tabulated. a visit here is prerequisite to all further study of the data by statistical methods. i shall have to ask you to pass up a visit to the well known array, ranking, and frequency tables states. there still exists disputed area around the frequency table, such as the choice of the beginning and extent of class intervals. these historic frontiers and the political devices such as ratios, proportions and percentages are visited by many tourists. let us proceed to two other states, where the calculations of measures of central tendency and dispersion are made. the central tendency state has several clans. in one, the arithmetic mean is the rule. a second group has a median rule, and a third group prefers the mode rule. near the mainland, there are islands between it and the analysis and theory continent. even on these islands mathematical definitions are required for the rules used for measuring central tendencies such as the geometric and harmonic means. as we go on into the dispersion state you will note that the topography is becoming less familiar. yet variation of individuals in a measurable characteristic is a basic condition for statistical analysis and theory. if uniformity prevailed, there would be no need for statistical methods, though descriptive methods might be desired. this variation state also has several clans. one advocates the range as the simplest measure to describe the dispersion of a distribution. another prefers the use of the mean deviation, while the most densely populated clan advocates the standard deviation. nearby is a frontier area where dwell less familiar and relatively uninteresting groups such as the quartile deviation and the 10 90 percentile range. in this descriptive methods continent, placed in the summarization of data country are other states settled by special purpose groups. let us now visit two, the index number and the description of time series states, to look at some of their unsettled and disputed frontier problems. the index number state, consisting of one or a set of measures for one or a group of units, evaluates indirectly the incidence of a characteristic that is not directly measurable. we do not have time to visit the single factor index area, but proceed directly to the wide open frontiers of multi factor indexes. for example, the price and level of living indexes are well known and of vital interest. on this frontier: (1) which multi factor index formula is the best? (2) what items should be included? (3) what is the proper weighting of items? (4) is the fixed base or chain method best? (5) how frequently should the base be changed? (6) when and how can you remove obsolete commodities and add new ones into the index? and (7) if the index number has no counterpart in reality, should it be discarded? to settle these frontiers, developments are needed on the borders with the theory continent. in the description of time series state, we find measures recorded on some characteristic of a unit (or a group of units) for different periods or points of time. there are several method groups governing this state such as inspection, semi averages, moving averages and least squares. of course, there are disputes about which method is best. one of the frontier problems is how to handle nonlinear trends. one group of statisticians exploring in this state deals with time series accounting for secular trend, cyclical, periodic, and irregular movements. note that most of the folks in this area are economists. the public health and industrial scientists are beginning to explore here. they have such problems as fatigue testing, incubation period of a disease, and the life time of radioactive substances. this is rather an exhausting tour, so much to be seen in so short a time. however, before you leave the descriptive methods continent, i want you to visit the presentation of results country. the availability and usefulness of whatever contribution to scientific knowledge the project has yielded are dependent upon the successful performance in this country. as we enter the presentation of results country, you will be asked to swear allegiance to logical organization, preciseness, and ease of comprehension. in this country, certain conventions in structure and style of the form of presentation have developed and are generally accepted. the methods of presentation of results divide into several states: textual, tabular, and graphic. the textual state gives only statements of findings and interpretation of results. the tabular state has two types of tables, the general and the special purpose tables, according to their functions. in the graphic state, presentation of quantitative data in represented by geometric designs. it is obvious that the tourist naive in mathematics will enjoy this state. some of the named community settlements are: the bar diagram, area diagram, coordinate chart, statistical map, and pictorial statistics. 3. design of experiments and investigations continent later in discovery and development was the analytical statistics hemisphere where the tools and techniques for research workers are provided and used. the northern continent, called design of experiments and investigations, is divided into two major sections, the design of experiments and the design of investigations. my own random walks have taken me into the design of experiment section of this continent more frequently and extensively than into any other area we shall visit. this section is divided into four major countries: (1) completely randomized, (2) randomized block, (3) latin square, and (4) incomplete block designs. the first three countries are the oldest and are well developed. however, in the latin square country, let us visit a newly explored state, where the latin square is adjusted so as to measure residual effects which may be present when the treatments are applied in sequence. we might inquire about the uprisings in the latin square country when nonrandom treatments are assigned to the rows and columns. this takes you over into the incomplete block design country. it is hoped that this area will be placed in the incomplete block design country without further trouble. the selection of the treatment combinations to go into these countries takes us into another dimension of this statistical universe. we have single factor and multiple factor treatment combinations. small factorial groups fit nicely into our design countries. if several factors are involved, we may need to introduce confounding. this requires settlement in the incomplete block design country, where there are more blocks than replications. some confounded areas are settled, such as those where confounding on a main effect, the split plot design country. here you find political parties with platforms ranging from randomization to stripping the second factor. this latter complicates its trade relations with the analysis countries. let us continue in the incomplete block design country and cross the state where confounding on high order interactions is practiced. right near, and often overlapping, is a new state using confounding on degree effects. these two states are being settled, with good roads already constructed, but the border has not been defined or peacefully occupied. a rather new and progressive group of settlers are the fractional replication folks. their chief platform is that five or more factors can be included simultaneously in an experiment of a practicable size so that the investigator can discover quickly which factors have an important effect on their product. in this area the hazard of misinterpretation is especially dangerous when one is not sure of the aliases. the penalties may be trivial. however, it seems wise not to join this group unless you know enough about the nature of the factor interactions. the balanced and partially balanced incomplete block states are being settled very rapidly. so far as experimental operations are concerned, the incomplete block design country is no more difficult to settle than the complete block design country. it will take some extra planning and analysis to live in the incomplete block country and you will have to have adjusted means. the weights to use to adjust the means are still in a frontier status. there are numerous frontier areas in this incomplete block country where roads and communications have been established. there are 376 partially balanced incomplete block design lots with k> 2 and 92 lots with k = 2 from which to choose. these lots have two associate classes. we should look at some of the newer settlements as (1) the chain block and the generalized chain block design states; (2) the doubly balanced incomplete block design state where account can be taken of the correlation between experimental units; and (3) the paired comparison design areas for testing concordance between judges, together with the appropriate agreements with the analysis continent. beyond the latin square country dikes have been built to provide new land. there are latin squares with a row and column added or omitted, or with a column added and a row omitted. further work covering more general situations will give this design continent more areas for expansion. let us go now to another large new country which, after negotiations, has been established by taking sections of the design and analysis continents. the process has raised some political issues and questions of international control. the development came about because, in the design continent, there is a twoparty system with data measured (1) on a continuous scale (quantitative variable) or (2) on a discontinuous scale (qualitative variable). these party members have settled side by side in the design continent for single factor groups. if we have factorial groups, we have to consider both whether the measures are continuous or discontinuous and whether the factors are independent or not. to handle these problems, some of the continuous scale statisticians have established a response surface country. to prepare for the peaceful settlement of this response surface country a portion of the regression analysis state has been transferred. whether this separation of portions of countries to make up a new country will hold, only time will tell. here in this rather new response surface country, observe that major interest lies in quantitative variables, measured on a continuous scale. in this situation, it is often natural to think of response as related to the levels of the factors by some mathematical function. the new methods are applicable when the function can be approximated, within the limits of the experimental region, by a polynomial. in this tropical and exciting response surface country, the central composite and non central composite states have been settled for some time. some of the other borders are not firmly fixed, as would be expected in a new country. new states identified as first, second, third, and higher order designs are seeking admittance to this country. they overlap with some of the older countries. we can stand over here on this mountain top and see many frontiers as the very special central composite rotatable design area, which has been named and partially settled with some roads constructed. over there is the evaluation frontier where the relative efficiency of these designs and methods needs to be determined. progress has been made on strategies to be used for determining the optimum combination of factor levels. in addition to locating the maximum of y, it is often desirable to know something about how y varies when the factor levels are changed from their optimum values. the efficient location of an optimum combination of factor levels often requires a planned sequential series of experiments. most experimentation is sequential, since the treatments are applied to the experimental units in some definite time sequence. to explore in this area, the process of measurement must be rapid so that the response on any unit is known before the experimenter treats the next unit. a method of sequential analysis gives rules that determine, after any number of observations, whether to stop or continue the experiment. the full sequential approach is often not practical, thus the two or multiple stage sequential plan with groups of units handled at one time takes us into the frontiers of this region. so far, the matter of testing hypotheses has been given major attention, but now sequential methods hold promise of increasing the efficiency of both testing and estimation procedures. are you ready now to visit the investigations (more popularly known as sampling) section of this design continent? since this section borders on the descriptive methods continent, both continents find that it is essential to maintain trade relationships. in all fields of experimentation and in most collections of descriptive data only a sample from the population can be considered. how to do this efficiently presents an extensive horizon. i hope you did not forget to get a visa permit to travel into the sample design territory. we shall quickly cross the settled simple random sampling country. here is the method of sampling in which the members of the sample are drawn independently with equal probabilities. this is a satisfactory place to settle if the population is not highly variable. on the frontier between this country and the other countries of this area, there are two problems: (1) how could the present sampling procedures be improved if the observations followed a standard distribution form? (2) what are the effects of nonrandomness? the inhabitants of these frontiers invade the settled areas frequently, and frontier battles result. next, we must cross the systematic sampling country. it is very difficult to secure permission from a statistician to enter this country. however, it is densely settled mostly by older people who have lived here all their lives. we frequently hear about uprisings and renewed efforts of this group to acquire all the advantages of the simple random sampling country. it appears that settlement in the systematic sampling country can safely be recommended if one of the following conditions exists, (1) the order of the population is essentially random, or (2) several strata are to be used, with an independent systematic sample drawn from each stratum. there may be populations for which systematic sampling gives extremely precise estimates of the mean but never gives reliable estimates of the variance of the mean. perhaps the most popular section of the sampling area is the stratified random sampling country. the population is divided into parts called strata, then a sample is drawn independently in each part. one popular political party selects the number of units per stratum by optimum allocation. the second party advocates selection of a proportionate number of units per stratum. some recently explored frontier areas are: (1) the determination of optimum allocation in multivariate studies, (2) the improvement of criteria for the construction of strata, and (3) the selection of the optimum number of strata. if you are interested in large sample surveys, you will want to visit the multi stage sampling country. here the first stage units may be selected with probability proportional to size, the second stage units with equal probability. an adjacent area has been explored where first stage units are selected with arbitrary probability. in newer areas of the multi stage sampling country more than one first stage unit per stratum is drawn in order to permit internal assessment of the sampling errors of estimates. even here many. of these large surveys have been relegated to the archives without securing the sampling errors of estimates. this is done perhaps because of the complexity of the estimating formulas. electronic computing machines are helping to settle this difficulty. in fact, the machines may open up even wider frontiers for settlement in the sample design countries. in all the sampling territory, there are many internal political and economic frontiers to be cleared. these sampling countries now have fair control over sampling errors but relatively little over non sampling errors. they realize the need to find an economic balance between investment on sample and investment on measurement technique. to these developing frontiers, we can add others such as: (1) what are the relative efficiencies of the various sampling plans? (2) what is the effect of nonresponse? and (3) what is an efficient method to sample for scarce items? efforts are being made to clear out the underbrush and to settle some of this frontier area around the sampling territory. 4. statistical inference; analysis and theory continent in the analytical statistics hemisphere, we have visited the northern design of experiments and investigations continent. let us start our tour of the southern statistical inference or the analysis and theory continent. the broad problem of statistical inference is to provide measures of the uncertainty of conclusions drawn from experimental data. all this territory, in the statistical universe, has been discovered and settled by a process of generalizing from particular results. let us visit several analytical technique countries, keeping in mind that the level of civilization in each of these countries is determined largely by the status of its theoretical development. first, here is the beautiful and popular t test country, where testing of hypotheses and setting up of confidence intervals for univariate populations are performed. this area is a tourist photographic paradise, but we cannot tarry. i know you will return. hurriedly, the way some tourists travel, we shall cross another univariate country, analysis of variance. almost all statisticians, except maybe a few theorists, have enjoyed the beautiful lakes and mountains in this country. among the attractive features to explore are the orthogonal sets of single degrees of freedom, the separation of simple effects when interaction exists, the use of both continuous and discontinuous variables and even the fitting of regression models for the fixed continuous variable. this latter region is being urged to establish an alliance with the response surface country. we have time to observe only a few frontier problems: (1) what is the power of analysis of variance to detect the winner? (2) how do you analyze data which involve both a quantal and a graded response? (3) how do you attach confidence limits to proportions? (4) what about nonhomogeneity of variance when making tests of significance? and (5) should we enter these countries with nonnormal data? i may just mention a subversive area, at least it is considered so by some, that is, the region where effects suggested by the data are tested. are you ready now to visit the correlation country? bivariate populations are often interesting because of the relationship between measurements. first, let us visit the well developed product moment correlation section, where the cultural level is high due to theoretical verifications. around here are several unincorporated areas, quite heavily populated by special groups, but not too well supported by theory. you should be careful if you visit the method of rank difference, p (rho), the non linear, 17 (eta), the biserial or the tetrachoric coefficients of correlation districts. while we travel across to the regression country, i might mention that its constitution has several articles like the constitution of the correlation country. the two are confused by some users of statistics and even by statisticians. we had better check to see if you have your visa before we enter the regression country. some of the acceptable reasons for granting visas are: (1) to see if y depends on x and if so, how much, (2) to predict y from x, (3) to determine the shape of the regression line, (4) to find the error involved in experiments after effect of related factor is discounted or (5) to seek cause and effect. some near frontier areas are being settled, such as those where there are errors in both the x and the y variables. other frontiers include the test of the heterogeneity of two or more regressions. how do we average similar ones? what about the nonlinear regression lines? as we leave the bivariate countries of the analysis and theory continent and enter the multivariate countries, we find that life becomes more complicated. all kinds of mechanical, electrical and electronic statistical tools have come into use. these countries have been developed from, but are not independent of, the univariate and bivariate areas by a process of successive generalizations. for example, people were taken from the t test country and by generalization they developed the statistics t country. this t group does all the things done by the group for any number of variates simultaneously, be they mutually correlated or independent. in this multivariate area, new territory related to the analysis of variance has been explored and is called the multivariate analysis of variance. here are theoretical frontiers to be explored. some are (1) what are the values of the roots of a determinantal equation and what particular combination of them should be used for a particular purpose? (2) what are the limitations and usefulness of the multivariate analysis of variance country? and (3) what are the confidence bounds on parametric functions connected with multivariate normal populations? the next time you come this way, i wish you would stop to explore the areas where the discriminant function and factor analysis methods are used. there may be some danger that the latter will not be able to withstand the attacks being made by those who advocate replacing factor analysis by other statistical methods. i personally believe the factor analysis area will resist its attackers and will remain in the statistical universe as a powerful country. the simple correlation ideas were generalized into two new countries, the multiple correlation country and the less well known canonical correlation country, which has two sets of variates. crossing the multiple regression country, we look at the frontiers. there are situations where it is desirable to combine scored, ranked, and continuous data into a multiple regression or factor analysis. how can this be done legally? what about the normal distribution assumptions? i cannot resist having you visit the analysis of covariance country for it accomplishes some of the same purposes as do the design countries. covariance helps to increase accuracy of estimates of means and variances. however, dangerous mountains exist in this country. the explorers may need to develop added theory to enable the applied statistician to reach the top of such cliffs as the one where the x variable is affected by the treatments. if the treatments do affect x, a covariance analysis may add information about the way in which the treatments produce their effects. the interpretation of the results when covariance is used requires care, since an extrapolation danger may be involved. now that i have acknowledged that we are in a dangerous area, i might state that the dangers of extrapolation exist in all regression and related areas, and especially back in the response surface country. we are ready to enter the variance component country, where separate sources of variability are identified. estimates of these variance components are desired. these estimates are used to plan future experiments, to make tests of significance, and to set confidence limits. this country is relatively new, so that adequate statistical theory has not been developed, thus leaving rugged frontiers: (1) the assumption of additivity needs to be explored in detail, (2) a clear statement is needed of how to decide whether the interaction in a two way classification is nonrandom or random, (3) more exact methods of assigning confidence limits for the variance components need to be developed, (4) how does one handle the mixed model? (5) how can one detect correlated errors? (6) what can be done to simplify the analysis of data with unequal variances? (7) what are the effects of various types of nonnormality on the consistency and efficiency of estimates? and (8) some study needs to be made of the proper allocation of samples in a nested sampling problem when resources are limited and good estimates of all components are desired. another section of the variance component country is called components of error. the problem of choosing the correct error term in the analysis of two or more factors depends upon whether the factors are random or nonrandom or upon the question you ask. do you want the mean difference between treatments averaged over these particular areas with narrow confidence limits, or do you want mean differences averaged over a population of areas of which these areas are a sample with broad confidence limits? so far, we have visited almost exclusively the parametric inference countries. let us take a glimpse at the frontier in the nonparametric inference territory. when the experimenter does not know the form of his population distribution, or knows that it is not normal, then he may either transform his data or use methods of analysis called distribution free or nonparametric methods. this territory is being settled. the area dealing with the efficiency of certain tests for two by two tables has been partially settled and some general theorems on the asymptotic efficiency of tests have been proved. some of the frontiers are: (1) what is the general theory of power functions for distribution free tests? (2) what is the efficiency of nonparametric tests? (3) can sequential methods be applied to nonparametric problems, and (4) how can two nonnormal populations be compared? there are three more general frontiers i wish to mention. (1) how far are we justified in using statistical methods based on probability theory for the analysis of nonexperimental data? much of the data used in the descriptive methods continent are observational or nonexperimental records. (2) what are the effects of nonnormality, heterogeneity, nonrandomness and nonindependence of observations to which standard statistical methods are applied? and (3) how can we deal with truncated populations in relationship problems? as we complete our tour of the three continents, i wish to emphasize the fact that there are many important problems of design and statistical inference which remain unexplored. 5. training frontier our travels took us to only a part of the statistical universe, but we managed to observe many frontier areas. i hope one thing impressed you: that is, the extent of the need for statisticians to explore these areas. in recent years, there have been advances in statistical theory and technology, but the prompt application of these to our biological, social, physical, industrial, and national defense needs has created an unprecedented demand for intelligent and highly trained statisticians. research workers in many fields are requesting the statistician to help both in planning experiments or surveys and in drawing conclusions from the data. administrators are facing the quantitative aspects of problems, such as optimum inventories, production schedules, sales efforts, pricing policies and business expansion, which call for new mathematical methods for solving problems concerned with decision making. it is certain that statisticians are destined for a larger role in the present and future ages. what are we doing about training? more universities are considering statistics as an integral part of the curriculum. they need to consider also statistical research as just as vital a part of the educational process, for it enhances the professional competence of the teacher and is beneficial to the student. the teachers of statistics, especially those who handle graduate students, must be research minded. banal as it may sound, the teachers of statistics should be trained in statistics. how many are? it is known that high school and college students are taking mathematics courses under teachers not trained in mathematics. the percentage of qualified high school teachers of science and mathematics has fallen about 53% in the past five years. the decisions that produce our scientists are often made before the student arrives on the college campus. we cannot supply the statisticians we need if students do not come to college and if they do not possess adequate high school preparation in mathematics and science. we need to learn how to educate children to think scientifically, how to select those best fitted for scientific research and how to train them. we must go into the recruiting and training frontiers. more consideration will need to be given to strengthening high school education in science and mathematics. we need to find ways to direct the ambitions of boys and girls. what we are facing is not a shortage of ability and talent, but a shortage of trained talent at all levels. to produce the supply of qualified students needed, the parents, teachers, guidance personnel, and public officials must acquire a full understanding of the statistical education problem. in 1955 there were listed 59 ph.d. degrees given in statistics in the united states and canada with only 20 universities contributing. here is a wideopen frontier. for every high school graduate who eventually earns a doctoral degree there are twenty five others who have the intellectual ability to achieve that degree, but do not. the supply seems sufficient. what are we doing to tap this supply? statistics is one of the sciences which is young and inexperienced. what the statistical universe is like tomorrow depends on the frontiers we open up today and the wisdom we use in planning for the occupation of this new territory. there are other wide open frontiers. (1) the area related to the revision and improvement of course content and teaching methods. we have gone a short distance into this region. (2) in the u. s. our people have profound faith in education, but they do not have equally profound faith in our educators. (3) whether we like it or not, in the culture which exists in our country today, the desirability of a given profession is measured largely in terms of salary. 6. conclusions as you statisticians continue your work, you will visit some of these frontiers. i hope next time you will go not as tourists but as explorers. ""statistician"" is a mere word denoting a certain aspect in a human being. the fact that you, as an individual, are classified as a ""statistician"" does not free you from obligations and responsibilities toward other human beings. some of you may feel that if you work hard and produce three published articles per year, then you are not to be held responsible for the consequences of your work. however, your food, shelter, clothing, physical and even social comforts and pleasures are provided by others. you have an obligation to clarify the foundations of your techniques and methods for your clients. our statistical methods should be tailored to the needs of the users, even if this calls for approximate methods. i want you young statisticians not to become men of success but rather to become men of value. let me give you one quotation from einstein, ""he is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. but a man of value gives more than he receives."" i do not decry individual effort, but, in considering the challenge of arid lands, we must have teamwork; that teamwork should be between individuals, universities, and research groups in this and other countries. one thing is certain, we are at the beginning of a new age an age that will be richer and will offer more and more opportunities for people whose minds are flexible and who are eager to increase their area of awareness. how big is the challenge and how far do these frontier areas extend? my reply would be like that of the taxi driver when the judge asked him, ""how far can you see?"" his reply, ""the sun.""",340,17.45,5.04904769930895,0.237316703185572,5933,1408,15.9133257205461,10.9133257205461,31,0.264125637791744,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1957.10501361"
1957,"52nd","Leonard, William R.","Male","United Nations","Government","117th","September 10–13, 1957","Atlantic City, NJ",NA,"An Outlook Report",1957-09-12,"William R. Leonard","1940-1969","last year your president spoke on the subject of ""statistical frontiers"" and l of an ever expanding statistical universe with bright and constantly moving horizons. the universe contained three continents descriptive methods, design of experiments and investigations, and analysis and theory.' tonight i should like to explore further some aspects of descriptive statistics, from the point of view of their meaning and substance, rather than from the point of view of method, with particular reference to the scope and magnitude of the work that lies ahead. as miss cox said, descriptive statistics are statistics in their oldest and most traditional form; they refer to problems of the state. it is true that statistical methods are now finding decisive applications in almost all branches of human activity, but this by no means diminishes the importance of their applications to economic and social fields. as professor maurice kendall said in his inaugural lecture at the london school of economics in 1950: ""it remains true, i think, that the work and welfare of mankind provide the most important domain for statistical inquiry. ""2 the scope of economic and social statistics, on an international scale, is already large and it is growing. if we assume that world population, now estimated at 2.7 billion persons, should continue to grow at its current rate of increase, total population will have doubled by the year 200o only 43 years from now. if we assume that the world will continue to produce goods and services at the rate which obtained from 1950 to the present, the world's product or income by the year 2000 will be nearly four times its present size. the statistical requirements which will be imposed by increases of these magnitudes will be very large indeed but these rates of increase do not represent the real challenge faced by economic and social statisticians. the economic and social world is not only growing larger but it is becoming vastly more complex. dynamic changes of great consequence are occurring or impending both in the highly industrialized countries of the west and in the now largely agrarian countries of the far east and africa. the common market proposals now being discussed, in europe and elsewhere, if instituted, would have very far reaching implications concerning the organization of production and the capital requirements needed to give effect to different production and trading patterns. the economic development programs now being undertaken by many non industrialized countries have similar implications. the magnitude of the latter problem can be sensed if we realize that some two thirds of the world's people live in under developed countries and receive only about one third of the world's income. this kind of comparison is the more striking when we realize that the roughly six percent of world population living in the united states receive over 40 percent of world income. if the under developed countries are to become industrialized in the western sense, enormous quantities of plant and equipment, transport facilities and indeed all types of productive capital must be created. from the statistical point of view, it will be necessary for the statisticians to develop statistical services to indicate the nature and size of the capital investment required. increased industrialization must have as basic requirements the development of suitable analytical methods and the availability of bodies of statistics to describe the problems and their relationships, to interpret the past and to plan the future. these responsibilities devolve upon the statistician, and in fact, he must anticipate them so as to avoid the waste and frustration which attend decisions based upon ignorance and supposition. whatever the rates of population growth and of economic development turn out to be, there will be multipliers of considerable size, as far as the statistical requirements are concerned, introduced by the expanding complexity of our economic and social environment and by the inherent propensity toward change. thus, vast new areas for the application of statistics in the economic and social field are emerging. in addition, large gaps in basic economic and social statistics remain to be filled even if we are considering simply the more or less conventional measures. for example, in only a few countries can we find size distributions of the ownership of land; for most of the world's populations there are no systematic sources indicating changes in rates of growth of the population, the incidence of the common diseases, the disposal of resources among different uses and among different economic classes. to fill the gaps, of course, is of outstanding importance but in addition i believe there are urgent reasons to re examine the methods and objectives of some of the traditional statistical inquiries. there is some tendency for economic and social statisticians to accept without much question the concepts and rubrics, particularly those of the industrialized countries, which have been handed down through several generations of statisticians. we have seen many instances where attempts have been made to transplant the statistical systems of industrialized countries to less well developed countries. in most cases it was found that the attempt was not satisfactory. this, of course, is not an unexpected result because the concepts and definitions adapted to one type of economy would not necessarily be applicable elsewhere. at the same time, questions also arise as to the applicability of some of the traditional concepts to the changed and changing nature of the industrialized societies themselves. in suggesting that the methods and objectives of the traditional inquiries be re examined, i do not mean that the conventional forms must be discarded. these must be strongly supported until new ones are developed and tested. all i am saying is that the statistical apparatus should be under continuous investigation to be sure that it is performing efficiently both as to objectives and as to cost and that it should be capable of reflecting the changing nature of the economic and social structure. let us examine briefly two areas of economic and social statistics one old and one new about which new thinking may be required. the census of population is perhaps the oldest statistical activity of states. its origin is lost in antiquity the book of numbers gives an account of the census of the tribes of israel while in roman times the census was already a regular tool of administration, used for the purposes of taxation and military conscription, the two main functions of the state at that time. in the 18th and 19th centuries census taking flourished, particularly in the americas and western europe. it was, of course, the principal statistical instrument at a time when the industrial revolution was having a profound effect upon the economic and social organization of society. it is true there were some other bodies of statistics, such as external trade statistics, but these were partly at least by products of administration. these new bodies of statistics resulted from the growing concept, and it is surprising how new that concept is, which regarded the state as an economic entity as well as a political entity for which economic policies and an economic climate had to be established. the population census received early international attention by the international statistical congress, which met nine times between 1853 and 1876, and by the international statistical institute, founded in 1885. at the 5th international statistical congress, meeting in st. petersburg in 1872, agreement was reached upon a standard list of questions to be recommended to national census authorities. the astonishing fact is that the list is remarkably like the list used today in many countries. it included name, age, sex, marital status, occupation and economic status i.e., whether the person was an employer or an employee. these categories describing economic characteristics, with modest expansions from time to time, have become pretty much hallowed by usage, and i believe there is some tendency for them to be regarded as adequate to distinguish the important characteristics of the population. a more critical view, however, might result in numerous questions. the economic status classification, for example, as applied to the economically active population was no doubt admirably suited to the circumstances prevailing during the height of the industrial revolution. in the age of the factory and of the craft union the distinctions between one industry and another and between employer and employee were abundantly clear and, what is perhaps more important, the ways of life of the members of the various crafts and industries were so different that they were in fact different social groups, the characteristics of which were worth distinguishing and investigating for the sake of the information they provided about the underlying nature of the society of which they were part. this contrasts sharply with the situation today when the plant worker may, at some time during the year, become an own account worker or possibly an employer. the description of his economic status therefore depends upon the time of year the census is taken. there is also the question of identifying employers in a large corporate enterprise the stockholders? the general manager? the foremen who have the power to hire and fire but in fact are employees? it is obvious that considerably elaborated sub categories within each main item would be necessary to clarify the meaning of the figures. but such elaboration is most certain to be costly and does not entirely dispose of the main question which concerns the purpose of the classification itself. what characteristics are these data expected to reveal today? how will we use them either by themselves or when cross classified with other demographic or economic characteristics? for purposes of this discussion, i am leaving aside questions of enumerator and response bias which are likely to be extremely consequential in connection with questions concerning rather vague and variable characteristics. the difficulties arising in connection with the status classification, and some doubt about its usefulness in any case, are so numerous that several national census offices are considering either abandoning the classification altogether or devising something entirely different. even in 1901, one commentator in referring to the 1891 census of great britain said: ""the attempt made to distinguish between 'employer' and 'employee' was admittedly not a success nor do i think any question can be framed which will serve to secure a categorical answer in every ease.""! but again, what is it we really require of a comprehensive census of population, with involved classifications set up to describe economic characteristics, conducted once in ten years, producing tabulated statistics one, two, three or more years later? the original idea of the classification was clearly to establish the numbers of persons in each class of worker group to allow certain inferences to be made as to levels of economic and social well being. it is clear that under present conditions, either in the industrialized or in the agricultural economies, this exercise is not likely to come very close to the mark. i have no specific proposal to make at this time but perhaps what is needed is a device which will classify the economically active population in such a way as to show more directly whether their capacity to command economic goods and services and to attain the more intangible social benefits is increasing or not. i am not certain that this is the right direction at all but i am certain that a great deal of thought will be given to this question in the next few years both by the national census offices and by the international agencies which are attempting to develop useful and acceptable standards for statistical work in this field. discussion is already going forward, and several countries are expecting to conduct field tests of different concepts. there is at least one other serious question about the classic approach to population censuses, and this concerns the occupational classification. i am told by my colleagues that this classification is invaluable. it provides an essential base for rates of occupational morbidity and mortality; it can be used for production planning as in war time and for occupational guidance; it is a basis for inferring something about the general economic well being of the economically active population and when cross tabulated with the economic status classification, produces a socio professional (or occupational) grouping which in some countries has considerable meaning; the occupational classification can be used to formulate and evaluate broad social programs such as education. but it may be, however, that statisticians are looking for the wrong things in population censuses. are we trying to study such things as industrial or occupational morbidity in small but vaguely defined groups and failing to study more general problems of radiation, air pollution and smoking? is it possible to produce sufficiently exact occupational data by census enumeration for production and occupational planning without undue delay? perhaps well planned sample surveys of occupations, or special registrations in times of emergency, would produce better statistics for these purposes. the occupational classification, like the status classification, is of a respectable age. it was first recommended for international use by the international statistical institute in 1892, having been drawn up by bertillon at the request of the institute.' there were 12 main headings: production of raw materials i. exploitation of land (including fishing and hunting) ii. extraction of minerals transformation of raw materials iii. industry iv. transport v. commerce public administration and the liberal professions vi. military and police vii. public administration viii. liberal professions ix. rentiers miscellaneous x. domestic servants xi. without employment xii. unproductive and unknown this classification was used without major changes in many subsequent censuses and is recognizable today in the international standard classification of occupations only recently established by the international labour office. in the latest classification, at least six of its eleven main categories are very similar indeed to the 1892 list. it is clear of course that such broad groups can have only very general meaning and are not of particular value for some of the specific purposes mentioned above. the same is true of the 9 major groups of the international standard industrial classification. to a certain extent the two classifications, in their broadest groupings, distinguish the same things, i.e., persons working in an agricultural establishment (the industrial classification) and farmers (the occupational classification). more specific uses, therefore, would require greatly elaborated detail even unto the third and fourth digit (in one under developed country the occupational classification scheme, used for population censuses, contains 2,500 titles). any extended classification immediately imposes very considerable operational problems. the increased number of groups probably increases enumerator and response bias and without question greatly increases tabulation and publication problems which of all census operations seem to cause the greatest difficulty. the tabulation problem is a very real one. even disregarding small area tabulations but these are almost universal full exploitation of the occupational classification requires cross tabulation by industry, by class of worker, and by sex. given the very minimum cross tabulations, where only the onedigit categories of occupation and industry are used, some 800 cells, disregarding small area tabulations, form the basic table. few countries confine themselves to the minimum, although some restraint is exercised in the two and three digit cross tabulations by occupation and industry. but usually many of the cells emerge rather sparsely inhabited. i find, for example, that on 1 april 1950, there were 5 female plumbers in maryland and 9 female blacksmiths in wisconsin, one each in the three metropolitan areas of madison, milwaukee, and racine, and the rest scattered throughout the state. while these are extreme examples, this kind of result, i think, is not statistics in the usual sense of aggregating observations to simplify analysis and understanding. this problem must also be examined and solutions found. considering the biases in the data, the cost, and the fact that these tabulations are among the last to be produced in almost all countries, statisticians may need to inquire into the specific purposes to be achieved by detailed census data on economic characteristics; into whether or not the classifications should be greatly shortened or perhaps combined with something like a class of worker grouping in a new form; into whether occupational details should be collected at all by a comprehensive census but rather by an associated sample survey which would have implications about the feasibility of small area tabulations and the use of extremely detailed occupational groups. while statisticians from several countries have told me that they have no trouble with the occupational classification from an operational standpoint, this does not entirely settle the basic question of purpose and use. have statisticians had sufficient regard for the transition from a largely handicraft to a largely machine age during the past century? having mentioned two problems which, in the oldest statistical field of all, need re examination, let me briefly touch on a new problem with which the conventional statistical apparatus does not deal directly and effectively. this is the question of measuring, nationally and upon an internationally comparable basis, what is now called levels (or conditions) of living. the traditional family budget or expenditure studies do not embrace the concept sought here although they have their place in the galaxy of studies which surround the central concept. what is wanted is a measure or measures which will somehow describe and summarize a person's position in the economic and social community in which he lives his housing, his health, his education, his nutrition; in short his command over all economic and social benefits, how they change in time and how they compare with benefits enjoyed in other countries. this, indeed, is a difficult problem and it is also an important one since one of the main purposes of modern organized societies is to adopt policies designed to support improved economic and social conditions for their citizens. the united nations, the international labour office, and other specialized agencies associated with the united nations, have given considerable attention to statistical techniques which might be expected to produce the desired results. without going into details, one proposal involves the selection of ""indicators"" such as expectation of life at birth, food supplies in terms of calories per capita, proportion of children five to fourteen years of age attending school and proportion of economically active population unemployed. these are largely elements plucked out of existing statistical systems of the conventional type. these measures obviously do not apply equally well to all countries or to all cultures, and there is no way of weighting them into any unitary index, though this is perhaps a minor objection. there is also the suggestion that properly planned and comprehensive family living studies on a sample basis, repeated from time to time in each country, would provide the necessary information. but there are problems here too; aside from the cost, considerable technical work would need to be done to stabilize response error in time to time comparisons and to provide for place to place comparisons at least on a minimum basis. i do believe that reasonably adequate measures of levels of living can be achieved in time but they present many difficulties of conception and operation that are far from being overcome. in attempting a rather concise outlook report on the world wide statistical situation i have so far dealt briefly with the present position (statistics generally are not adequate), with the general dimensions of the tasks that lie ahead (assuming rather rapid rates of change), and with a few problems of content and method which may illustrate the need in a changing and developing world for a re examination of conventional concepts in some subjects of economic and social statistics. under these circumstances, how well equipped are. we nationally and internationally to meet the challenge offered? in this respect there are entries on both sides of the accounts. on the debit side there still remains a desperate need for training and education in statistics, most particularly in the under developed countries. training is required at all levels from the mathematical statistician, who can work out suitable statistical methods for practical problems, to the full cast of specialists, clerks and administrators. in under developed countries more emphasis must be given to sampling than to the older and more conventional methods if adequate statistics are to be available for general policy guidance. secondly, in most countries of the world the salary levels and tenure of statisticians in the national services are very unsatisfactory. the comparatively low salary scales result in high turnover rates. statisticians who have received advance training at home or abroad are likely to be lured to higher salaried posts elsewhere in government or in business. the lack of tenure in many national services means that the systematic development of statistical programs and of training operations is seriously impaired. while these are long term problems and depend for their solution upon general administrative improvements in governmental organization, it is interesting to note that a few countries, with assistance from international statistical agencies, have managed to establish a statistician class in their civil services which is at least as well paid as other professional groups. thirdly, all national services suffer, to a greater or lesser extent, from inadequate and uncertain appropriations. this is a familiar problem and one which in the end results in waste and extravagance. relatively expensive programs such as censuses are sometimes never completed so that countries are deprived of the contributions these statistics could make to the conduct of their affairs. here again solutions must rest upon the gradual development of more stable and more mature government administration. although we cannot really measure the value of statistics to a country we can confidently assert that there is a very large discrepancy between cost and value, as governments and other institutions are coming to realize. there are, however, a number of encouraging entries on the credit side of the accounts. since the end of world war ii the statistical establishments in a large number of countries have been greatly strengthened and in others national statistical services have been set up for the first time. in most countries, the statistical programs have been overhauled to satisfy more nearly the requirements placed upon them. in these activities the international inter governmental agencies have played a considerable role, mostly by giving advice and assistance to requesting countries in organizing, or reorganizing, the national services, and in providing expert guidance in re shaping and modernizing the statistical programs. since 1948, for example, the united nations, the international labour office, the food and agriculture organization, the world health organization, and the other specialized agencies of the united nations family have supplied more than 200 experts to 52 countries for periods running from a few months to two or three years. this is small in relation to the requirements, but funds are limited. even more limited, however, is the supply of advisors with suitable experience available for assignment. many different factors account for this and the statistician who says ""have slide rule, will travel"" is most eagerly sought. the international organizations are also tackling the training and education problem referred to above. this is being done in several ways. the statistical advisors are generally expected to organize in service training courses and to help select qualified candidates for more advanced training abroad. this is normally in the form of fellowships and scholarships extending for periods of six months to two years. since 1948 more than 450 statisticians from 76 countries have received advanced training under grants from the international agencies. in addition an average of 30 new students have enrolled in each of the ten terms of the international statistical education centre at calcutta, which is carried on under 'the auspices of the international statistical institute with the very generous assistance of the government of india. a similarly sponsored institution at beirut, financed by the government of lebanon, private grants, and contributions from united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization has served 141 students during four terms. the inter statistical institute has established a permanent center at santiago and sponsored three shorter term courses elsewhere in latin america. the statistical training center at the university of the philippines, established by the united nations in 1954, has had an average of 80 students during each of the six semesters. all these activities have a considerable impact on the level of statistical competence but there are often discouraging setbacks. i heard recently that two young statisticians who spent a year at one of the best european training institutes were persuaded upon their return home to join a different ministry in their government than the one responsible for statistics. in that country there is only one trained statistician actually working in statistics. apart from these more or less permanent centers and the system of fellowship awards, the international agencies have arranged for a large number of ad hoc training centers or seminars. these operate for periods of a few weeks to three or four months and have taken up a variety of subjects in the fields of agriculture, industrial production, labor, population, vital and health statistics, trade and balance of payments, statistical organization and statistical methods, particularly sampling. in all since 1948 there have been 45 such centers or seminars, attended by 1600 participants from more than 100 countries. many of the centers have been sponsored jointly by two or more international agencies in co operation with the host governments. i should note that the international agencies are not alone in giving statistical assistance and advice and in providing facilities for education and training in statistics. several national governments, particularly the united states and the countries participating in the colombo plan such as canada, are carrying on extensive programs in close co ordination with the international activities, and many other governments, particularly in western europe, are providing excellent training facilities for foreign students. associated with the educational enterprises and the training centers in the effort to improve the general level of statistics throughout the world is the preparation of technical guides or manuals which set out, step by step, concepts and methods involved in particular applications. these ""do it yourself"" handbooks are invaluable materials either for organized training courses or for use by working statisticians in national offices. a number of manuals on subjects in the economic and social fields, dealing both with substance and with methodology, have already been issued by the international agencies and several more are in preparation. these represent a unique literature never before available. they deal mainly with the practical problems of applied statistics which are likely to be encountered by the statistician of new and underdeveloped countries. they are based, as far as practicable, upon the uniform definitions, classifications and methods developed by the international organizations. the development of uniform statistical standards recommended for use by national statistical services owes much to the earlier work of the international statistical congress, the international statistical institute, and, after world war i, to the league of nations, the international labour office, and the international institute of agriculture. development of new standards and the revamping of older standards have been fairly rapid since the end of world war ii. the present standards have been worked out upon a basis of broad agreement with national statisticians so that they represent expert opinion as well as a synthesis of views upon problems and methods of practical application. this procedure has resulted in a much wider acceptance and use of the recommended proposals than obtained in earlier days. in general there are a few exceptions recommendations of international organizations are not mandatory upon governments. acceptance by a country must depend upon whether the proposals are technically sound and conform with national requirements. it was the desire on the part of some members of the international statistical congress to impose recommendations upon governments, that wrecked the congress in 1879 when bismarck withdrew german participation and other countries took similar action thereafter. one more word about present arrangements for the development and improvement of international statistics. a number of forums exist for the discussion of statistical problems. the statistical commission of the united nations, composed of statisticians from fifteen countries, meets once every two years to review the statistical position generally and to act upon recommendations for standards on subjects within the competence of the united nations itself and to lend general support to the related programs of the specialized agencies. some of the specialized agencies have statistical committees, composed of national statisticians, which meet from time to time. the international conference of labour statisticians, which held its first meeting in 1923, meets periodically. the international statistical institute, while now concentrating its attention mainly on aspects of education and training rather than on the promulgation of recommendations, exerts a powerful stimulus to the development of statistics generally. apart from these world wide institutions there are now several regional organizations which discuss, and make recommendations concerning, regional problems and the adaptation of international recommendations to regional conditions. the work of the inter statistical institute, organized in 1940, is well known to you. to some extent the institute has an independent program but in other respects it acts as a regional forum for discussion of questions referred to it by the united nations and the specialized agencies. the united nations has organized, in co operation with its regional economic commissions, the conference of european statisticians (1953) and the conference of asian statisticians (1957). these groups are composed of the heads of the national statistical offices and by means of plenary meetings and ad hoc working groups on particular subjects bring regional viewpoints to bear on world wide recommendations. in conclusion, after this brief review of existing arrangements to improve statistics throughout the world, i should like to add that the enthusiastic and fruitful collaboration of national governments in international statistical work has been the most important force in the accomplishments so far. and this, of course, is the main reason why one may reasonably expect that the work that lies ahead in filling gaps, in re examining objectives and programs, in devising new methods for new and expanding problems and in training the present and future generations of statisticians will be carried on with enthusiasm and success. the outlook is good.",198,25.5050505050505,5.36792079207921,0.273465346534653,5050,1381,20.3142370237024,15.3142370237024,44,0.791722113911571,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1958.10501418"

Hoadley","1940-1969","let me say at the outset that this has been a very interesting and worthwhile l year for me as president of your association. i've particularly enjoyed the opportunity to widen my acquaintance considerably among statisticians not only in this country but in canada and many sections of the world. when the year began i really thought that i had a fairly good understanding of who statisticians were and what they did but very frankly i've learned a lot. my experiences this year have made me much more conscious of the tremendous breadth of the field of statistics and the seemingly almost endless diversity of our professional interests and applications. at the moment, i'd be hard pressed to mention a field of science, business, agriculture, labor, or government in which statisticians are not active or statistics not gaining greater acceptance and use. in the business and economics statistics field with which i am most familiar, i am particularly conscious of the major forward strides which statisticians and statistics have been making. yet, our colleagues with other specialized statistical interests would have no trouble demonstrating, i'm sure, that parallel or even greater gains are being achieved elsewhere in our profession. i need only to mention the fields of weather; physics, including astro physics and rocket research; legal evidence; biology and medicine; and engineering, including testing of materials and location of factories. automatic data processing certainly received its most important original boost from statisticians. as rather conclusive evidence of the rising interest in statistics, the membership of our association has increased substantially this year. at the beginning of the year we had 5,667 members, and today the membership numbers over 6,400, an advance of more than 10 percent. this increase is particularly significant in light of the economic recession which has prevailed this past year. noone can say with any real precision just how many statisticians there are in the united states today. a great deal of the difficulty of determining this number lies in the definition of ""statistician."" whereas only a few thousand men and women possibly identify themselves as ""statisticians,"" for example, on income tax returns, hundreds of thousands use widely varying statistical techniques every day in the course of their work. doctorates in statistics granted to date in this country which leads the world in statistical usage would number less than 500, with only 27 granted in the 1956 57 college year. but more and more doctorates are being granted in statistics than ever before and many doctorates in other fields now include requirements in statistics (e.g., my own doctorate in economics). the very small number of doctorates in statistics points to the present basic scarcity of statisticians. each successful demonstration of how statistical techniques can be used to solve important problems has whetted the appetite not only of statisticians but especially policy makers whose interest and support can have a profound effect upon the future of our profession. one of the most significant developments in recent years has been the acceptance by the general public of indeed the demand by citizens at large for more statistical information. at times it seems hard to realize that many widely used current statistical measures and techniques have had their origin within the past two decades, and many older ones have become sufficiently well understood that they can be mentioned without explicit definition in the press and over radio and tv. i have in mind such measures as gross national product, labor force, personal income, weather developments; polio, cancer, heart and other health statistics; agricultural crops and forecasts; accidents; births and deaths; metropolitan and suburban growth; school needs; and election and sports statistics. i don't mean to imply that statistics of all types have become a featured attraction for daily living far from it. what i do mean is that the level of literacy and general understanding has advanced so much that it is possible to arouse interest in numerous subjects these days by statistically gathered and appraised facts as well as emotions. the new break through in statistics, of course, has been aided immeasurably by marked advances in electronic computers of many sizes. high speed electronic equipment now makes possible statistical inquiries which previously lay beyond human practicability. for several years it seemed to be more fashionable than economical to have a huge ""electronic brain"" installed in many operations. however, the ""shake down"" era is nearing an end. tangible cost saving results are beginning to be achieved, particularly in business. the statisticians' tools have improved immensely in recent years, increasing not only the efficiency and effectiveness of statisticians at work, but vastly enlarging the opportunities for statistical inquiry. as a corporation treasurer, i am well aware of the premium which the investment specialists place on ""growth"" companies. these latter are defined generally as companies which have demonstrated ability to expand faster and more profitably than the industries of which they are a part and the national economy as well. it seems clear to me that the ""growth"" label can be properly affixed to the field of statistics and to the expanding opportunities for statisticians generally. statistical needs and applications are expanding on all sides; more individuals are employed on a full or part time basis to use statistical techniques than ever before; much improved equipment is available to get the job done more swiftly and accurately, and extensive research is under way to find still better methods and machines. yes, we can take a great deal of satisfaction in the growth of our profession in recent years. we can be proud of the status and achievements of statisticians today. we can look forward confidently to still greater accomplishments over the many tomorrows ahead. but, before we allow ourselves to become too satisfied as members of the statistics profession, shouldn't we also take stock of the problems or roadblocks to be overcome before tomorrow's potentialities can be fully realized? frankly, such problems and roadblocks are not hard to find. in fact, an impartial observer might even conclude that all is not nearly as well with statistics and statisticians as might appear from the encouraging growth story which has just been presented. there is one general and continuing problem confronting our profession, largely because of the diversity and varying degrees of interest in statistics. it concerns the scope and effectiveness of publications. since this problem already is getting a great deal of official attention, i do not plan to discuss it specifically here. our competent publications policy committee and editors are carefully studying this entire matter and further progress in publications can be expected. at least five other major problems, however, confront the statistics profession and hence in many respects the statistical association as well: (1) a dangerous cleavage between so called mathematical or abstract statisticians and so called non mathematical or applied statisticians. (2) a lack of a comprehensive retraining and refresher plan for practicing statisticians. (3) an all too frequent failure of statisticians to pursue their work to the point of interpreting their findings and aiding policy making. (4) the absence of a vigorous program to win broad support for better statistics in public and private life. (5) a strong tendency toward splintering of interests into specialized statistical fields. let us consider each of these problems and some suggestions for their solution. 1. cleavage between mathematical and non mathematical statisticians all statisticians, of course, use some mathematics but there is quite a difference these days in the extent to which advanced or higher mathematical techniques are employed. many statisticians trained before world war ii who incidentally now often hold some of the highest professional and policymaking positions shy away from describing themselves as statisticians. they feel some inadequacy about their command of mathematics and frequently believe they no longer qualify as members of the statistical profession. it is becoming increasingly evident that there is a substantial difference in the degree of mathematical preparation among practicing statisticians, while this has always been true, the difference has now become increasingly significant because it provides the basis for a growing cleavage among our membership. those who speak a language largely of mathematical symbols and formulae appear to have less and less in common with those who employ more simplified techniques and expressions, and vice versa. how often have you heard members of our association not to mention members of many other related professional associations observe that an article or discussion is either ""too cluttered up with mathematical equations"" or ""too superficial and general"" to be of interest. such comments are overt symptoms of the cleavage between statisticians who greatly emphasize mathematical techniques and those who take a much less rigorous mathematical approach. unfortunately, this cleavage often becomes so deep seated that many statisticians find themselves literally forced to take sides, i.e., to classify themselves as members of either the higher mathematical or non higher mathematical camp. the final step is often withdrawal of individuals and groups from general activities and discussions at national, regional, and chapter meetings into tightly knit groups or organizations evidencing pride in their command of, or contempt for, mathematics. perhaps i've overdrawn this point a bit, but i have a great deal of personally compiled evidence that this cleavage problem is not just imagination. all this might seem amusing if it were not so far reaching and potentially dangerous for all of us. continuation of this cleavage trend not only could foreshadow disaster for our association, but could threaten to undermine the ability of the statistical profession to serve many important fields of endeavor by spreading disunity and dissension. in my judgment, this cleavage problem is the natural outcome of professional advancement. it arises principally because of the refinements made in statistical techniques resulting from wider application of rigorous mathematical disciplines in solving statistical problems. the growing use of electronic computers and related high speed equipment has been an additional factor. those who have contributed to or benefited from the mathematical break through in statistics during the past decade or two rightfully and understandably believe others are overlooking tremendous opportunities for improved problem solving when they ignore or otherwise fail to use the newer applications of mathematical techniques to statistical methodology and analysis. certain mathematical statisticians may tend to give the impression that they now have a superior standing in the profession since they have a greater command of the latest statistical developments which admittedly seem to involve a good deal of mathematics. i am sure that such psychological considerations have aggravated the cleavage problem. those who cannot or will not admit to being mathematical statisticians usually are frank to admit they do not have the mathematical training to follow in detail many of the newer statistical techniques and applications. commonly, however, they hasten to add doubts about the necessity or advisability of using higher mathematical language in dealing with many statistical problems. they bluntly challenge some claims that advanced mathematical techniques eliminate judgment biases, by drawing attention to the human selection factor in picking assumptions underlying many complex mathematical formulae and equations. nevertheless, these same statisticians pay a good deal of tribute to the internal consistency and logical development process to be found in the wider use of mathematics in solving statistical problems. by now most of you probably will have decided whether you fall into the ""heavy on the math"" or ""go easy on the math"" category and have reasoned that i've not adequately stated the case for your side. i wonder, however, if you wouldn't all agree that fundamentally this cleavage problem concerns the means and not the end of statistics, which is to help analyze and solve important problems affecting almost all aspects of human existence. the key objective is to get each problem correctly solved whatever it is and of far less importance is precisely how this is accomplished. if each one of us will keep this basic end of statistics in mind, we will have taken a long step forward in settling this cleavage problem. but there's much more to do to insure that more or less mathematics is not allowed to cause a further and perhaps far reaching schism in our professional ranks. ideally from at least one viewpoint, the ""non higher math"" group could all go back to school and learn or brush up on mathematics. this has some obvious practical limitations. i'll comment a bit later on meeting the retraining and refresher needs of statisticians. suffice it to say here, the wider applications of mathematics to statistics and electronic equipment are of such obvious magnitude that they cannot be lightly dismissed. as a minimum, each non higher mathematical statistician owes it to himself to evaluate (with the aid of an interpreter if necessary) the alleged advances and contributions to statistics from more extensive use of mathematics. not until this has been done can anyone rightfully minimize or ignore the increasing role of mathematics in the field of statistics. i suspect that the expression ""ignorance breeds contempt"" may have some application in statistics as well as in other fields. n ow i have a few words for the mathematical statisticians. i have been greatly impressed by the contributions to statistics made by more extensive use of mathematical disciplines. however, i suspect from checking the literature and evaluating discussions i've heard or participated in that there is a noticeable tendency for some mathematical specialists to become more interested in problem solving per se than in using their skills to meet some of the practical problems of the day. with mathematics, it's really so easy at times to skip over the troublesome and seemingly minor variables and reach conclusions which really don't solve the policy problem at hand. would you agree again that it is the end and not the means of statistics that really counts? no one can object if specialists develop and use a language all their own that is, for a while. but unless this language after a reasonable amount of time can redound to the benefit of others especially in this case, those less skilled in mathematics, wouldn't it be proper to question the time, effort, and money spent developing the language? all statisticians, whether primarily mathematical or not, need to learn how to express themselves in nontechnical language. statistical shorthand is absolutely essential, but when data are presented to policymakers and the public they must not be in our shorthand. in my judgment, one of our profession's greatest needs is for a means to get the so called mathematical and so called non mathematical statisticians to sit down regularly with each other and explore areas of mutual interest. in most instances, the ends will prove to be the same. why shouldn't it be possible to achieve greater understanding and mutual trust by carefully exploring the advantages and disadvantages of particular means? it is my recommendation (1) that our association organize a new committee on statistical techniques and applications to bring together individuals representative of the degrees of mathematical training of our membership to investigate the full scope of this cleavage problem and to suggest a program to minimize it, and (2) that immediately all program committees and publications officials in particular cooperate closely with this new committee to help achieve better understanding in all areas where this mathematical cleavage problem exists. 2. lack of comprehensive refresher training plan in any field where rapid advances in theory, techniques and applications take place, inevitable refresher training problems arise. teachers, of course, are constantly under pressure to ""keep up"" in their fields and to incorporate the newest developments to the fullest extent possible in their own courses. while there are inevitable lags between research and practice on the one hand and textbooks, articles, and instruction on the other, teachers typically have both the professional incentive and opportunity to keep reasonably abreast of advances in their given fields if they desire to do so. for the individual who is a practicing statistician rather than a teacher, the problem of ""keeping up"" can be a fearful one. after considerable formal training in statistics under recognized authorities, let's say a statistician starts to practice his profession in a private business organization, public utility, labor union, or government agency. he brings to his new job a capital fund of knowledge and must gain as quickly as possible the practical experience needed to do his job well. his work environment, particularly the availability of others with his same interests and access to essential literature, plus his own personal determination will largely influence whether he keeps abreast of important developments. without regular study, however, any practicing statistician is almost certain to find with the passage of time after concluding his formal education that he's drawing heavily upon his capital fund of knowledge and not adding regularly to it. how to keep up becomes a fearful problem indeed! the problem becomes even more acute for the statistician who advances to the point of assuming administrative responsibilities. first, he begins to lose touch with day to day statistical operations; second, his responsibilities often become so broad that he cannot hope to keep up in all the specialized areas under his administration; third, his associations are more and more with executive and other administrative people who look to him and his subordinates for technical assistance; and fourth, the time available for study seems to diminish directly with rising official, professional, civic, family, social and related duties. many of these ""administrative"" statisticians from time to time have a frightening experience when they browse through a copy of a current technical journal or read a report from one of their own staff. the material often doesn't seem too familiar and at times isn't even intelligible. such administrative statisticians may well be doing an outstanding job, but can't help wonder if they wouldn't be able to contribute more if they had the benefit of greater understanding and wider application of newer theories and techniques. during the past year this refresher training problem has arisen in many discussions. statisticians in a wide variety of fields and holding positions of varying responsibilities have inquired about opportunities for refresher training courses. frequently, the request is for a survey course of trends and developments in statistical theory, techniques, and practice rather than for a course devoted to the specific details involved. others want to learn rudimentary mathematics to understand better much of the current statistical literature. still others desire to learn more about a particular technique which they have reason to believe would help them in their work. it is only natural that statisticians should turn to the statistical association for help in keeping up to date in their profession, and i firmly believe the asa should make a strong effort on their behalf. the association today offers a great deal in the way of literature, but relatively little assistance in the specific refresher area. scores of our members, of course, are busily engaged in teaching adult classes j brief regional and local conferences have been held; and a few outstanding summer courses are now available. but, the asa really has no formulated national program to meet what seems to be a pressing need from many of its members. admittedly successful development of a refresher program will not be easy, as some preliminary investigations have revealed, but the results could be very rewarding to our members and the association as well. the needs of unnumbered potential enrollees will vary widely; duration and location of refresher courses will pose obvious problems; recruitment of a faculty which can conduct survey refresher courses and bridge the gaps between theory and practice as well as mathematical and non mathematical approaches may well present some unusual difficulties; and adequate financing must be assured. nevertheless, an effective, comprehensive refresher training program definitely seems needed to improve the general level of statistical techniques in use, to improve statistical understanding, and to win wider membership support for our association. therefore, it is my recommendation that the board and council of the statistical association (1) request the section on training to appoint a committee of outstanding educators and practitioners in the field of statistics to explore carefully and determine as clearly as possible the refresher training needs and desires of our membership; and (2) upon establishing the magnitude of such needs, plan an appropriate continuing refresher training program, to begin no later than during the summer of 1960. 3. statisticians, data interpretation and policy making most people will agree that statistics have their greatest importance as an aid to policy making and the decision process. better information obviously has some value per se, but unless it contributes to improvement of some decision making process, it really adds little or nothing to the betterment of mankind. policy decisions invariably concern the future. hence, if statistics and statistical techniques are to be useful, they too must point to the future. in my judgment, statisticians should have a continuing and aggressive interest in data interpretation and in forecasting as an aid to policy making in whatever capacity and field they serve since presumably they know more about statistics than anyone else. all too often statisticians tend to shy away from data interpretation and forecasting. many will engage in elaborate and costly statistical research and analysis, but frequently when confronted with the task of drawing significant conclusions as well as making recommendations for the future, will shrug their shoulders or explain with righteous indignation ""that's not my job."" in these instances, statisticians in fact are trying to abdicate any responsibility for the ultimate decision to be made. from the policy maker's point of view, such an attitude neither engenders confidence in the statistician's work nor in the contribution and stature of the statistical profession. in every field we represent, data interpretation, decision making and forecasting are unavoidable and inseparable. frankly, there is no escape from forecasting. therefore, in my judgment, there is no reason for any of us to shy away from it, particularly when as statisticians we have so much potentially to offer which will help narrow the degree of error in each forecasting and decisionmaking process. many top level executives have told me this year that the tragedy of statisticians so frequently is that they will do an enormous amount of work but stop short of the point of making a positive contribution to policy. that contribution usually would be a helpful interpretation of the data, a suggestion, or a recommendation for future action based upon the statistician's findings. without such positive statement, the policy maker is likely to feel the statistical investigation is not worth too much or, as so commonly happens, will select from the mass of statistical data presented those facts and figures which will support his own preconceived notions. the net result for the statistician and his profession is virtually zero; even worse, by refusing to follow his work to the point of stating his own positive interpretation of his findings, the statistician allows himself to be a tool of the non statistical policy maker who can with prudence then use the statistical findings to suit whatever purpose he may have in mind. sometimes as statisticians we like to hold ""post mortem"" discussions about our policy making superiors, do we ever rationalize that ""if they had only taken our advice or asked us they wouldn't have made such a mistake?"" this comment presupposes, of course, that we've taken time and felt it was our duty before the decision was made to tell the boss what we believe was the proper interpretation of our statistical findings and what would be a wise policy based upon our statistical investigations. there may be, and usually are, many other considerations besides our statistics which must be weighed in a given policy decision, but we have no right to be critical unless we've carried our statistical work to the point of its greatest potential usefulness to policy makers. this plea for greater interest in data interpretation and in policy and decision making is not in any way intended to weaken a statistician's objectivity, but rather to make his work and professional standing more significant. admittedly, some statistical work may seem actually to be far removed from final policy decisions, but i'm convinced most statisticians are closely linked to the decision making process if they will only take time to seek clearly the end use of their efforts. it is my strong recommendation (1) that each member of the asa reappraise the contribution which he or she is making to policy in the field being served and seek to enlarge that contribution, and (2) that the asa give greater emphasis in its entire program to the encouragement of statisticians to make this a still more dynamic policy contributing profession. need for broad support for better statistics despite the striking growth in the acceptance and use of statistics in this country and all over the world in recent years, enormous gaps in statistical knowledge obviously exist. appalling deficiencies in the quality of existing statistical series persist. these statistical shortcomings are evident in both ""public policy"" statistics and what are sometimes called ""market or private policy"" statistics. public policy statistics refer to those which are needed by government officials to insure fair and equitable development and administration of public laws and policies. private policy statistics cover those which individual organizations of all types require to meet both profit and non profit objectives. in many respects, public policy statistics have now passed from the stage of public apathy to mild interest. in the business and economic statistics area, however, badly needed improvements in ""public policy"" statistics have been repeatedly voted down, all too often in last minute adverse decisions, by congressional joint house senate conference committees. as a result, in many important legislative and executive administrative fields, far reaching decisions affecting vital industries and areas and millions of people are being made on the basis of admittedly weak and misleading statistics. why this highly undesirable situation should continue is not easily explained. at the root of the problem lies the lack of appreciation by many people, including some in high government positions, of the importance of having more satisfactory statistical information on hand to guide key policy and administrative decisions. closely allied is the failure of most people even directly affected by government policy decisions to appreciate the basic weakness in the statistical information used in formulating and executing such policies. in a great many instances, at least as much progress has been made in recent years in improving private policy statistics as public policy statistics. private organizations which have grasped the importance of more and better statistical information for proper decision making are now spending substantial and growing sums for statistical and allied investigations. in more and more companies, for example, a major decision won't be made without a careful survey of all relevant trends and developments plus the preparation of detailed forecasts of future developments. statistical expense budgets are rising among many private organizations, but aggregate outlays are still quite small and coverage is spotty. moreover, those who insist on having better information to guide their own businesses or other activities typically show little or no concern about the need to improve public policy statistics which can and do have a profound effect upon their own operations. it seems obvious that there is a large educational ""selling"" job to be done to obtain far greater grass roots support for better statistical programs. a great deal of preliminary work leading to this objective has been done, but it is now time for the statistical profession to go on the offensive. selling is not usually considered to be a statistician's function. i am convinced, nevertheless, that our profession must now sharpen its selling skills. this association specifically must intensify its efforts to demonstrate convincingly the enormous contribution of statistics to modern life, and to publicize widely and in readily understandable language the opportunities for appropriately trained individuals to have interesting and profitable careers statisticians. as appreciation of the need for better statistics grows, interest and support for statistics by both public and private organizations inevitably will increase. it is my recommendation that the statistical association (1) create a public relations committee to develop an educational program to inform the public of the growing helpful role of statistics and statisticians in all walks of life, and (2) reconsider its long standing policy against making public comments on the quality or quantity of available statistics in any field and take a more positive stand for more and better statistics, especially in the ""public policy"" area. 5. splintering of statisticians into specialized organizations with the recent noteworthy growth of the statistics profession, it is surprising that specialized interests have begun to assert themselves. at present our association has five sections: biometrics (formed in 1941); training (1944); business and economics statistics (1950); social statistics (1953); and physical and engineering sciences (1954). our latest directory shows over 90 percent of our entire membership has expressed an interest in one or more of these sections. specialized interests can be seen in the percentages of total membership giving preference to individual sections: training 18 percent; biometrics 22 percent; physical and engineering sciences 25 percent; social statistics 30 percent; and business and economics 62 percent. these sections have proved to be highly useful and effective in stimulating greater interest among our members, in planning annual meeting programs, and in contributing to our publications. requests for still other sections to be chartered within the asa are to be expected and in my judgment should be approved whenever sufficient need can be demonstrated. as important as these sections are, however, their very existence reflects a number of serious problems for our association and the statistical profession. first, there is a marked tendency to de emphasize the common interests among statisticians by stressing their specialized interests; second, the natural crossfertilization processes within the profession are reduced; third, the costs of our association as well as allied groups are increased, particularly as requests for more and more specialized publications are granted; and fourth, there is everpresent threat that specialized groups will withdraw from the parent association. this splintering problem is by no means unique within the statistics profession. actually, i find that it is common to virtually all professional groups and organizations. i've had several occasions this past year to discuss splintering problems informally with top officers of other statistical and related associations. frankly, many are deeply concerned. they see a tremendous proliferation of professional statistical organizations each dedicated to some important but nonetheless limited objective, yet all competing to some extent with each other. they see the need for more specialized programs as their organizations grow, but also observe a resultant sharp rise in operating costs. they note some' lessening of general interest in the parent association, yet often a growing dependence upon the parent organization for guidance and financial support. i am sure that much good could be gained for all concerned if top level interassociation contacts and discussions could be pursued officially and regularly. this year an important first step has been taken by the statistical association and the society for quality control in the joint sponsorship of a new statistical publication in the physical and engineering field. here at least is one illustration of a successful effort to bring statisticians closer together, and incidentally to save money over the cost of separate publications by both organizations. to date the statistical association, in my judgment, has been strengthened rather than weakened by the chartering of its five sections. it is apparent, however, that the splintering trend now merits top level study' and attention. therefore, it is my recommendation that (1) the chairmen of the five aba sections be requested to meet regularly with the board of directors of the association to assure closer coordination of national and sectional interests and activities; (2) the program committee for each annual meeting seek meaningful co sponsorship of it greater number of sessions by two or more sections to further understanding and cooperation between sections; and (3) the president of the association pursuant to the authority just granted him by the board and council undertake to establish close and continuing relations with the chief executive officers of other statistical and related associations to the end of fostering better understanding among statisticians and a greater interchange of ideas on problems of mutual interest. summary and conclusions i fully appreciate that each of the five major problems which has been discussed as an actual or potential roadblock to further vigorous growth in the statistics field is not going to be solved readily nor as the result of mere suggestions made in a presidential address. the answer lies chiefly in a fuller appreciation of the scope and significance of these problems by statisticians generally as well as by those charged with official duties within our association, plus a determination by all to take needed action! let me make clear that it will require a good deal of time, effort, planning, cooperation, patience, perseverance, and money: (1) to bridge the mathematical cleavage existing in our profession; (2) to develop an effective refresher training plan for practicing statisticians; (3) to convince statisticians generally that they have a responsibility to their profession as well as themselves to pursue their work to the point of more positive aid to policy makers; (4) to go on the offensive to win broad support for better statistics in public and private life; and (5) to insure that splintering of specialized interests does not undermine the strength of our profession and association. but, i have no doubt that the human and financial resources will be found to meet these problems under the capable leadership and loyal membership which this association will have in coming years. as statisticians we all have reason to be proud today the record of growth and accomplishment is impressive. with the enthusiasm and determination now evident within this profession and this association, there is strong reason to face the future with confidence. for, in my judgment, it is very clear today that the statisticians of tomorrow will have a still greater role in shaping destiny.",242,23.7231404958678,5.31126981362132,0.255182024037624,5741,1465,19.6948413758654,14.6948413758654,34,1.87168520679669,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1959.10501495"

seems appropriate when the statistical association meets in washington to examine in what ways statistics can make an even greater contribution than at present to the well being of our nation. while my re marks and illustrations will deal with the united states, i believe that the general conclusions are applicable also to canada and other nations. every nation is in a continuous state of change. sometimes the changes are great, sometimes small, but change is always occurring. the conditions requiring these changes arise both from within and without. as a consequence, there is never ending need for decisions guiding corrective and adaptive adjustments to the causes of change. the adequacy of these decisions to meet the cur rent and developing situations in each nation determines the well being, power and future of that nation. we are coming to recognize with increasing clarity that the capacity of a nation to function well depends both upon the quality of its decision making processes and upon the adequacy and accuracy of the information used. if the information available for decision making is inaccurate or is incorrectly interpreted, the diagnostic decisions are likely to be in error and the action taken, in appropriate. sound decisions require accurate information dealing with relevant dimensions of the problem as well as correct interpretation. the way doctors diagnose an illness illustrates the process. a physician needs two different kinds of information to make a correct diagnosis. first, he must know a great deal about the nature of human beings. this knowledge is based on extensive research which relates symptoms to causes, measurements of body conditions to the health of the organism, and thereby reveals the character of the human body’s normal and abnormal functioning. this knowledge gives the doctor a more accurate understanding of how the system ought to function so that he can know what he needs to measure and how he needs to interpret the measurements. the second kind of information needed by the doctor to discover the patient’s state of health at any particular time is that revealed by the appropriate measurements and tests made on that patient at that time. in diagnosing its problems, every nation faces a situation similar to the one just described. it needs to understand the fundamental nature of its system and the way in which its component parts function. this basic knowledge is a necessary prerequisite to the determination of what specific measurements should be made and how they should be interpreted. for purposes of easy reference let us call these two kinds of information, respectively, information as to the nature of the system and information as to the state of the system. by information as to the state of the system let us mean the statistical measurements which reveal the current situation of the nation or economy such as population data, price indices, and measures of the level of business activity. by information as to the nature of the system let us mean the basic conceptual model or understanding which serves as a guide to tell whet dimensions of the nation, or society, or economy should be measured and how these measurements should be interpreted in making decisions. this information as to the nature of the system includes, of course, both the conceptualizations themselves and the extensive, quantitative measurements which are re quired for valid conceptualizations. it is the job of statisticians, in cooperation with other scientists, to provide the two kinds of information needed for effective self guidance. in the united states, and i suspect also in canada, our attempts to provide both kinds of in formation have not been equally successful. we are doing a far better job of collecting information about the state of our nation than we are of obtaining data dealing with the nature of our nation and developing valid generalizations and theories based on these data. this deficiency would be serious enough if the nature of our nation were static or changing slowly, but the evidence suggests that this is not the cam. our society is growing more complex at an accelerating rate. this makes it even more important that we take the necessary steps to achieve and maintain fairly continuous understanding of the basic nature of the nation. as statisticians, i believe we have a major responsibility, along with our scientific colleagues, to learn much more about our society’s fundamental nature. without valid undes standing and correct conceptualization of the nature of our society, we cannot know what measurements to obtain nor how to interpret these statistics correctly. we have been talking up to this point about the nation as a whole. now let us single out an important problem, juvenile delinquency, for a closer look. measurements dealing with the state of the problem, such as the frequency of juvenile delinquency, the kinds of persons involved, and kinds of communities in which delinquency is high are fairly good and are improving. the serious deficiency today is the appallingly small amount of systematic, quantitative re search devoted to understanding the nature and causes of juvenile delinquency and discovering the kinds of statistics which will be most valuable in assisting our society to take the steps needed to reduce delinquency substantially. we need analyses which will tell us not only what is happening so far as delinquency is concerned but why it is happening and what to do to correct un desirable situations and trends. until the needed research is done and adequate statistics are available, there will be continuous and widespread advocacy of steps to deal with the symptoms of delinquency rather than its fundamental causes. thus, for example, on the basis of available statistics dealing with the state of the problem, many prominent people are urging such steps as greater police resources and other punitive steps. no doubt these are needed temporarily, but the very small amount of research being done on the fundamental nature of delinquency indicates that these are costly ways of dealing with the symptoms and are likely to aggravate rather than cure the underlying causes. until a few years ago it was difficult to obtain more than a few thousand dollars for research on any problem dealing with youth. now a major government agency and a major foundation are making some funds available. but according to the best available information, the total amount being spent today on fundamental, long range research to understand the nature of delinquency is still less than one million dollars per year. the costs of the proposed research on the underlying causes of delinquency would be repaid many times over each year in the dollars saved as well as in a substantial increase in human well being. relative to the magnitude of the costs involved in policing delinquency, handling delinquents in courts, and the detention of those found guilty, the expenditures for the needed research would be small. juvenile delinquency is clearly a problem where there is urgent need for measurement and analysis focused on helping understand the nature of the problem. the research needs to be long range in character and in financing rather than a series of year to year projects. let us turn now to an entirely different question, namely the united states economy. our economy is a tremendous machine. we collect a great mass of statistics to tell us about the state of this great economy. we know its gross national product, we know much about employment levels, price levels, and have many aggregate measurements of financial and other variables. but in contrast to all this information about the state of our economy, we know much less about its nature and how it actually functions. for example, we cannot predict with satisfactory accuracy the level of consumer purchases of durable goods nor the level and form of consumer savings. we have few data and little understanding concerning the conditions which lead to new technologies and great increases in productivity. quite generally we depend upon out moded and inadequate models of our economy to tell us what to measure. let me illustrate. in october, the national bureau for economic research issued a report which indicated that we need more knowledge about the problem of economic growth. the bureau’s study found that there is “a pronounced dearth” of systematic, quantitative studies of the growth of different economies. the report questioned, for example, whether economic growth can be smooth or must involve at least one break a sudden take off in the rate of development. until we statisticians and our scientific colleagues have obtained the measurements and conducted the analyses to answer this as well as the many other questions cited in the report, we do not know whether we are gathering the really important statistics to measure the growth of an economy and how best to interpret such statistics. price problems are another example. there is widespread discussion of how prices can best be stabilized. there are, as we know, great differences of opinion on this question. these differences can be resolved only after there has been basic, long range, quantitative research. a wide range of studies are needed including research on such questions as: what are the costs to the nation and internationally of stable price levels, of unstable price levels? how can price levels best be stabilized with the least adverse effects? how are decisions made about the pricing of the factors of production and the pricing of components as well as final prices? how do consumers and industrial buyers respond to fluctuations in price levels? when the price of a consumer durable goes up or down, what changes occur in the motivations to buy? how do price changes interact with such variables as economic optimism and income expectations in influencing the decisions of consumers and businessmen to buy and to invest? as these questions illustrate, we need to understand the dynamics of consumer buying decisions on the one hand and the dynamics of producers’ pricing decisions on the other. we will not understand the nature of our economy until we have available the results of basic research dealing with these and related problems. without this understanding, we cannot know what statistics are needed to guide decisions for the correction of undesirable trends in price levels. the serious and extensive costs which we as a nation incur because of our in adequate understanding of the nature of our economy is well illustrated in our attempts to deal with the problem of achieving price stability. the steps used to control inflation in recent years lean heavily on conceptualizations which in adequately reflect the developments in our economy. according to these conceptualizations both inflation and economic stability depend largely upon the supply of money, including the cost and availability of credit. because of the inadequate theoretical framework and insufficient statistical data on business and consumer motivation and behavior in inflationary periods, the agencies responsible for maintaining price stability are faced with the necessity of using outmoded procedures which affect much more than the price level. restrictions on credit that prove effective in restraining price increases may also have serious and widespread side effects on employment and output. much more re search is needed before we will know what additional instruments of public policy would be useful to supplement monetary and fiscal policy in dealing with these problems. this basic research is greatly needed, but is not likely to be carried out until two interdependent conditions are met. first, adequate funds to do the re search must be made available as required. second, many more scientists in statistics, economics, social psychology and related fields need to become ex cited by the importance and significance of this research, involved in carrying it out, and pressing to have it done. this is a responsibility which we all share. the problem of price stabilization is so complex and involves so many dimensions that the research required to shed light on it will necessarily have to draw in a coordinated way upon the methodologies and theories of several related sciences. an important part of the basic research will have to be done on a large scale basis by organized teams of researchers. progress toward the solution of the problem of how to control prices without adversely affecting the economy would be worth a great deal to our country in terms of money saved, human suffering reduced and increases in goods and services produced. the sum required for basic research focused on understand ing the functioning of prices in our economy would be appreciably less than the savings achieved. the resources now being devoted to systematic, quantitative research dealing with prices and other important economic problems are small in relation to the magnitude and importance of the problems. our economy will soon be at the 500 billion dollar level, yet the amount spent for basic, quantitative re search on these economic problems appears to be no more than a few million dollars at most. accurate information is not available on the funds spent on this economic research but the situation appears to be about as follows. in 1957, the last year for which data are available, all of our foundations and voluntary health organizations made available a total of $14.3 millions for basic re search in the social sciences. of these $14.3 millions only a very small proportion was devoted to quantitative economic research aimed at increasing our understanding of the underlying nature of our economy and of such processes as economic decision making. similarly, the national science foundation has only recently undertaken the support of research in the social sciences, and, consequently, has had little opportunity to provide any funds for the support of basic economic research. the conclusion seems warranted that we are devoting far fewer resources to the systematic, quantitative research needed to understand the nature, as opposed to the state, of our economy than sound, conservative management would demand. without this research we do not know what variables to measure, how best to measure them, nor how to interpret correctly the measurements obtained. as a consequence, we are managing our economy in an un necessarily inefficient, costly and wasteful manner. may i cite a final example to illustrate the magnitude of the urgent need for research devoted to understanding the nature of our society and to indicate the additional statistics which we should collect. we are obtaining more and better data on employment, unemployment, and on the number of people employed in different industries. we also have extensive data by major industries on payrolls, productivity per man hour, the total goods produced, and many similar measurements. we also have data on strikes, their number and the man days of work which are lost. all these data are widely used to guide policy and other decisions and can very profitably be expanded. valuable as these data are as measurements of the state of the labor force and its utilization, they tell far too little about the nature of our manpower and productivity problems. we need research to tell us how and in what mays we can use our manpower more efficiently. i suspect that this research would indicate a need for statistics dealing 4th such variables as the following: what management principles and practices yield in the long run the highest productivity, least waste and highest levels of employee satisfaction and employee mental health? to what extent is each major industry or each governmental agency making effective use of those management principles which yield the best results for it? what principles and practices of relationships, negotiations, and media tion are most effective in coping constructively with union management differences? to what extent is each major industry or agency using these principles? what is the level of conflict between management and labor in each major industry and in each major governmental agency? what factors aggravate the conflict between management and unions and make some of the conflicts be tween them irreconcilable? why? what steps are most likely to yield constructive results? some of these statistics will be most appropriately collected by the federal government, some by the industries or unions involved. based on the studies done on these manpower and organizational problems to date, there is good reason to expect that reasonably intelligent use of the general principles and new statistics likely to be produced by the proposed re search would yield appreciable improvements in output and in the satisfactions which people derive from their work. field tests applying the findings of recent studies demonstrate that productivity increases equal to or greater than those achieved by traditional principles of management can be obtained from new principles. furthermore, these new principles can achieve and maintain productivity increases without creating the anxieties, hostilities and resentments which ordinarily accompany the increases in productivity achieved by use of the traditional principles of management. the available evidence supports the conclusion that the proposed research and the new statistics on manpower utilization mould make possible decisions which would significantly improve organizational performance and employee mental health. each problem area which we have examined yields the same answer to our basic proposition. in each case evidence supports the conclusion that we need the measurements and analyses to tell us much more about the nature of our nation, its economy, its productive facilities, its social system, and the motivation and behavior of its citizens as consumers, producers and members of its society. we as a nation are devoting an inadequate amount of our gross national product to the systematic, long range quantitative research required to enable us to understand the nature of our nation and its economy and thus help us to decide what statistics should be obtained regularly and how to interpret these statistics correctly. one of our greatest national resources is our capacity as a nation to face facts objectively and use measurements to guide our decisions. in order for us to use this resource to its full potentiality, it is essential that adequate and accurate information, correctly interpreted, be available to guide decision making processes. without such information we cannot use fully and effectively our democratic traditions and values. this makes clear the crucial role of statistics. there must be at all times adequate measurements and competent analyses to reveal correctly both the nature and the state of our nation and its component parts. the full potential of statistics is available only to ourselves and nations like ours. it is not available to the soviets and similar nations so long as they follow their present theory of governmental and industrial organization. under the illusion that their doctrine provides answers as to the nature of their economy and their industrial organizations, they are blocked from doing the research which they themselves need in order to understand their rapidly changing nation, its economy and its organizations. their system specifies the statistics which should be obtained for them to know the state of their economy and organizations. moreover, their doctrine is presumed to yield the best interpretation of these statistics and the best decisions. there is little place for re search to discover a better understanding of the nature of their economy, their political organization, and their industrial organizations. to conduct such re search and to learn what statistics would be more valuable than those now obtained and how to interpret these statistics correctly is likely to be hazardous for the social scientist who is rash enough to undertake it. very few soviet social scientists will collect and publish data challenging the underlying assumptions of the basic doctrine guiding the decision making processes of their country. yet these assumptions and the doctrine based on them are becoming progressively out moded as industrial societies move forward. the incapacity of the soviets to use measurement and research to improve their understanding the concepts of their society and its manner of functioning gives us a great and powerful advantage, providing we make full use of this asset. if the soviets and nations like theirs ever start using measurements and research to improve their understanding of their economy and their social system, i should not be surprised if the results push their doctrine in the direction of our basic political and organizational philosophy. statistics is playing a crucial role in our life as a nation. it is imperative that statistics play this role well in order that our nation, its industries and government function at their full potential. for statistics to perform one of its most important roles, we must have an accurate understanding of what to measure, how to measure these variables and how to interpret the data correctly. we must know how to diagnose correctly every set of statistics. for this to happen it will be necessary not only to collect more statistics but to obtain the measurements, conduct the analyses and develop the conceptualizations needed to understand far better the nature of our economy, our industries and our society. a balanced job must be done in collecting information about the state of our nation and about the nature of the nation. to achieve this balance, basic research is needed on all aspects of the nature of our nation. this research will require the coordinated efforts of statisticians and our colleagues in such related sciences as economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. it is our responsibility to press for this coordinated research and to participate whole heartedly where necessary in the organized, team research likely to be required for its successful execution. substantial bodies of quantitative data are needed upon which to build the valid conceptualizations which are required. finally, it is to be hoped that the private foundations, the congress, state legislatures, and the executive branches of federal and state governments will recognize the need for this research and mi11 provide the necessary, stable, long range financing to support it.

Hansen","1940-1969","introduction the statistical association, organized over 120 years ago, is one of the oldest scientific societies in the united states. from the beginning its areas of interest have had considerable breadth, although the principal emphasis in the original organization and activities was strongly on the development of factual information to guide governmental policy, programs, and administration in the general areas of economic and social development and public health. we are now witnessing unprecedented growth and expansion of statistical theory and applications accompanied by increased recognition of the role of statistics by workers in the various subject fields. although applications and supporting theory are growing in almost every area of economic and social activity and of science, potential contributions are still generally underdeveloped. organized statistical groups, and especially the statistical association, have an obligation to stimulate progress and to provide leadership, services, and channels of communication for facilitating effective development. this situation poses some questions and challenges that merit discussion by members of this association and also by others interested in the development and application of statistics. the rapid expansion in the role of statistics in the past few decades has led to the organization of a number of new scientific societies with an important interest in statistical theory and methods or in the development, application, and improvement of statistics in various subject matter areas. thus, the 1930 to 1940 decade saw the organization of the institute of mathematical statistics, the econometric society, the population association of america, and the psychometric society, since world war ii other societies added include the association for public opinion research, the operations research society of america, the institute for management sciences, the biometric society, and the society for quality control. the 1948 reorganization of asa the presidents of the association in 1944 and 1945, helen walker and walter shewhart, and others, gave considerable attention to expanding requirements, and to the role and organization of the association, and proposed steps for adapting asa to meet the new challenges and changing conditions. walter shewhart in his 1945 presidential address discussed the widespread gains in statistics and summarized with the following remarks: ""the statistical front is the whole field of science.... ""to insure continued advancement on the statistical front, we need a strong professional organization backed by all statisticians working in the many different subject matter fields: an organization whose purpose shall be to foster in the broadest manner the science of statistics and its applications; and to promote a unified, effective organized effort in advancing the common interests of all professional statisticians. ""to this end, such a professional organization needs to conduct joint meetings and conferences with many organizations in the fields of pure, background, and applied research with whom official contact has never been made in the past; to establish joint committees with other scientific groups wherever necessary; to produce and distribute publications devoted to statistical methodology and statistical knowledge of common interest to all professional statisticians; to provide the public through the press, lecture platform, and radio with reliable information about the science of statistics and its contributions; and to stimulate statistical research and promote high professional standards in all statistical work. I hope and believe that the statistical association, with the cooperation of other organized societies interested in statistics, can be developed into a strong organization to serve the common interests of all professional statisticians in these groups. "" constitutional changes, introduced in 1948, established the present form of the asa.1 these changes were directed at strengthening and encouraging the development of sections and local chapters within the asa. they also attempted to strengthen communications and joint activities by establishing an arrangement whereby other societies with a strong interest in statistics would be encouraged to become associated with and participate in determining the policies and activities of the asa. an associated society is represented on the asa council, and on the publications committee, and on the editorial board of the statistician, and thus has a voice in the asa policies and programs while retaining its status as an independent and autonomous society. progress in serving wider role of statistics many of the efforts towards broadening the role of asa have met with success, and some have not. the membership of the asa has more than doubled in the last 15 years, with 3400 members at the end of 1945 and more than 7500 today. the chapters have grown from 24 in 1945 to 41 today (with two new chapters this year), and their meetings and other activities represent an important service to members and other groups. it seems to me that through the sections asa has been especially successful in the effort to fulfill a broader central role. in 1945 we had a section on training of statisticians, and a biometrics section. the business and economic statistics section was organized in 1950, the section on physical and engineering sciences in 1953, and the i minor revisions occurred subsequently; the date of the present constitution is january 1954. under the general program chairmanship, the sections take much of the responsibility for planning the programs for the annual meeting. moreover, they initiate and support training programs and special studies, organize various joint and special meetings, prepare publications, and engage in other activities. they have a strong voice in the management of the association through representation on the council. thus, the chapters and the sections broaden the activities of asa to help serve the needs of various groups. the steps taken in 1948 and subsequently, to bring asa into a position to serve as an association of statistical societies have not been successful. only one group, the eastern north region of the biometric society (enar), has become an associated society. i shall review, briefly, the relationship of asa to some of the other scientific societies which have a strong interest in statistical methods or applications. the institute of mathematical statistics was formally organized in 1935, but was in a sense initiated in 1931, when the annals of mathematical statistic8 was initiated. the annals was given some initial support by the asa, when it was recognized that the journal of the statistical association was not adequately serving the need for a journal reporting on advances in mathematical statistics and probably should not be modified so drastically as to serve this need. in the years since the annals was initiated and the institute of mathematical statistics organized, the institute has grown and come to serve an essential and basic role in statistics. the ims has chosen not to become an associated society of the aba, but there has always been close cooperation between the two societies. nearly two thirds of the members of the institute are also members of asa, and about one sixth of the much larger and more diverse membership of the asa belongs to the institute."" the asa and ims meet jointly at many of their respective annual meetings, approximately in alternate years, and at various sectional, regional, and chapter meetings. nominations to the asa board are usually made so that the board will include some members of the 1ms council, in order to facilitate cooperation and communication. currently, half of the asa council are members of the institute. frequently, special joint arrangements have been made to perform functions of general interest to statisticians. the ims regularly meets also, with the mathematical society (as well as other societies) and provides liaison between the mathematicians and the statisticians, and i understand that some 1mb members feel that it would be unwise for the institute to develop too close a tie either to statistics or mathematics because it might tend to weaken its relationship to the other. the biometric society was organized in 1949, as an international society, and the biometrics bulletin (initiated and published at that time by the biometrics section of the asa) was transferred to the biometric society to serve as its journal. roughly half of the north members of the biometric society are also members of the asa, and these constitute about a tenth of the asa membership. as indicated earlier, the enar of the biometric society is an associated society, and cooperation has been close. however, the biometric society last year decided to terminate an arrangement whereby asa members were granted a special rate of $4 on their journal, biometrics. i believe that the biometric society concluded that most asa subscribers would become full members at $7 if this special rate were not available, and that this has proved to be true. the society for quality control was organized in 1946, bringing together engineers, statisticians, engineering aides or quality control supervisors, and others interested in industrial quality control. i believe the primary orientation of this society is toward engineering as its area of activity j however, quality control depends on statistics for development of its basic methods, and an important segment of the asqc membership is primarily interested in statistics. about 8 percent of the members of asqc are also members of the asa, and about 10 percent of the asa members belong to the asqc. one highly effective step toward cooperation between the two organizations is the joint sponsorship of the new journal technometrics, which is in its second year and is being well received. the econometric society meets jointly with the asa at many annual and other meetings. roughly one fourth of its members are also asa members, and cooperation has been long standing. we have little experience with joint meetings or other joint efforts, on the other hand, with the psychometric society (50 to 60 percent of its members are in asa), or with the operations research society of america (roughly one fifth of its members are in asa), or with the institute of management sciences (roughly one fifth of its members are in aba), or with the association for public opinion research (about one fourth of its members are in the asa) or with the population association of america (about half of its members are in asa). the society of actuaries and the asa have had relatively little direct communication, and only a very small common membership, although perhaps a fairly substantial area of common interest. cooperation has been extensive and long standing with the economic association, especially in the form of joint meetings. nearly 20 percent of the members of the aea are members of the asa, and these constitute a little more than 20 percent of the membership of the asa. we meet jointly with the economists along with a number of other social science societies in many of our annual and other meetings. the percent of overlap with the marketing association is of the order of 10 percent, each way, and there is an extensive history of joint meetings. role of sections and developmental committees of asa in considering the cooperation of asa with other societies it is worth particular mention that the biometrics section of the asa has continued, subsequent to the organization of the biometrics society. this section has remained strong, healthy, and effective and has been the primary instrument of cooperation with the biometric society. william g. cochran, in his asa presidential address in 1953, suggested some good reasons for continuation of the section as a meeting ground for biometricians with other statisticians in the setting of a statistical society, and for the biometric society as a primary meeting ground for biometricians with biologists. this may have established a useful pattern. the same approach has, to some extent, been followed in other fields, with the business and economic statistics section, the social statistics section, and the physical and engineering sciences section representing various subject interests in the asa development and programs, and serving as liaison groups with certain counterpart societies outside asa. there are a number of other fields where committees have been or are in process of being appointed to guide asa in the determination of its appropriate role, to stimulate work within asa, and to develop joint activities with other societies. some of these activities may lead to new sections. considerable progress has been made in the application of statistics in many new fields, and accounting is one where recognition of the possibilities and work on advancing methods and applications are in progress. we have recently appointed a committee in this area. joint work with the accountants until recently has been very limited perhaps this is the beginning of a more extensive development. recently, also, asa has appointed a committee to work with the meteorological society committee on agricultural meteorology, and, in addition, to explore generally our appropriate role and activities in meteorology. perhaps this committee, or possibly another one, should consider also, the role of statistics in the broader area of what might be called the atmospheric and space sciences. we are currently working on the establishment of committees in three other areas: management or operations research, marketing, and computers. these committees will explore the statistical role in each area, examine the needs, and stimulate appropriate activities. perhaps other areas need attention. the council, the officers, or the committee on committees would welcome ideas and suggestions. it might be worthwhile, for example, to establish a committee on applied statistics, without regard to the particular subject field of application. the basic principles and to a very substantial degree the methods of statistics are general in their applicability, whether in various fields of social science, or in the natural or physical sciences. many statisticians are highly effective as specialists or consultants in developing and applying statistical methods to problems without specialization as to subject matter. they are able to perceive the essential nature of problems involving uncertainty in a wide variety of situations and to develop and apply statistical and other quantitative methods to aid in their solution. the contributions of the general statistician, who can take a scientific approach to anyone of a wide variety of problems involving the collection and use of data to guide decisions, as distinguished from developing theory for its own sake, or from being a statistician specialist in a subject matter field, seems to be inadequately recognized in the asa structure at the present time. need for cooperation among statistical societies i mentioned earlier the recommendations by walter shewhart and others of the need for a more unified organization and approach in promoting the fuller utilization and development of statistics, and the steps asa took in an effort to serve as a unifying and central statistical organization. certainly these steps have led to progress in many important respects, as is indicated by the diversity and progress of sectional activity just described. however, they have resulted in little progress in bringing together a formal association of societies. rensis likert, president of the asa last year, recognized the desirability of clarification of goals and of what should be done. he discussed with various groups the possibility of increased cooperation among societies with a strong interest in statistics. after obtaining an indication of interest and approval from the aba council, and from a number of other societies, he proposed organized discussions on this type of cooperation extending over a considerable period of time. he also laid the groundwork for a modest grant of funds from the rockefeller foundation to support exploratory discussions. this year we have completed the formal arrangements, have received a grant, and with the 1mb and enar of the biometric society as joint hosts, we have arranged for an initial meeting next month among representatives of a number of societies with a strong interest in statistics.' we also appointed an asa committee, to consider implications and alternatives, to bring together and summarize some of the ideas of a wide representation of our members on this subject, and to advise the board of directors and the council. purposes of further cooperation i should now like to summarize some questions and comment on the purposes, methods, and possible results that might come from more effective cooperation, as a background for further consideration and discussion among asa members and for our discussions with other societies. (1) is there a need for a coordinating organization or approach among primarily statistical societies, beyond what is now accomplished by the cooperation among aba, ims, the biometric society, and others? what purposes are to be served that are not served just as well by the existing methods of achieving cooperation? in my opinion there are few if any specific programs that could not be accomplished by the cooperation of the type that has been existing; moreover, exploration by the asa committee and others has indicated that there is a considerable but not a predominant body of opinion that this is a sufficient and adequate approach. however, the fact that needed programs might be accomplished does not mean that they will be accomplished, short of more sustained • this initial meeting was held on september 16, 17 and 18, and a strong interest was expressed in increased cooperation by all representatives present. an intersociety committee was appointed to carry on further explorations and develop a proposal. strong leadership than can now be marshalled. there is rather widespread opinion that progress is hindered by lack of a more coordinated organization or more effective cooperation. some of the purposes to be accomplished by greater cooperation that have been discussed include the following: (a) the federal government in its scientific, economic, international, personnel, and other programs, looks to scientific societies in various fields for effective advice and guidance. grants of funds for research and fellowships are made on the basis of such advice and it is available in most scientific areas. for example, the national academy of sciences calls on scientific organizations for advice through national committees representing scientific disciplines. there is no such national committee for statistics. again, the u. s. civil service commission has requested advice on the classification and recruitment of statisticians. to some extent asa and 1ms are now providing such advice, but it is not unified and many believe it is not strong, or even heard in many instances where it should be. (b) sustained and strong leadership is needed if we are to develop desired projects, promote new activities, or get more general recognition of the nature and role of statistics, and consequently fuller utilization in the widespread areas in which statistics can make basic contributions. the breadth of use of statistics is growing extensively, but still is far short of what it could be as a fundamental tool of science, of administration, and of policy guidance. stronger leadership and a stronger voice should help in achieving these aims. i have felt, for example, in my experience as president of the asa this year, that there are many ways in which advances should be made, but that have been seriously handicapped by inadequate resources. progress has been made, but the steps taken have been inadequate in spite of in my opinion rather considerable efforts within the bounds of what can reasonably be done with limited available time of the officers and part time executive direction. it seems to me that a full time executive director and fuller staff support could add greatly to our ability to develop and progress on worthwhile activities, and that prospects for providing these could be greatly enhanced with a stronger central statistical organization. a more unified approach can more readily support the kind of staff and leadership that is needed to conceive, explore, promote, and carry through the wide variety of activities on which we should be engaged. (c) communication among producers of theory, applied statisticians, and consumers of statistical consultation and statistics in various subject areas might be strengthened by a stronger coordinating organization. perhaps these could be helped not only by joint meetings but by more surveyor expository articles, by stronger efforts to bring producer and consumer together, by the fuller development of training materials, and by other devices that need to be recognized and promoted. (d) some of the steps taken to achieve improved standards of statistical work should involve cooperative effort. there are some who believe that the widespread adoption of standard methods, or of standards for certifying statisticians might handicap progress rather than promote it. but even if this is assumed there are still many areas in which more work on standards might be of real assistance, including the general areas of terminology, notation, graphic and tabular presentation, and availability to review, evaluate, and promote improved statistical work as applied to important problems in which there is a strong public interest. (e) many specialized services can be developed as an aid to the more effective accomplishment of the programs of the cooperating societies. such services are not essential to but may be facilitated by and may be a highly useful outcome of greater cooperation. on the basis of the experience of other societies it appears that some of the service functions developed would be adopted by some but not all participating societies. among the services that might be developed are the following: public relations services. staff work to guide the preparation for, and organization of, conferences and meetings. central file maintenance for membership subscriptions, and related operations, including addressing and mailing. a placement service. a visiting speakers service to aid universities, local groups, and others to get access to qualified speakers on statistics. special bibliographic and book review services, bringing together indexes, abstracts, guides, etc. exchange arrangements on subscriptions to journals and other publications of the societies that will reduce costs and encourage more widespread reading and communication across the applications and developments in different subject areas. (x) numerous other management and staff services. (2) societies in other disciplines generally have faced this same question, as their roles have been widened and activities specialized in a diversity of areas. as the biologists, psychologists, physicists, mathematicians, chemists, and others have faced the situation of increased diversity of interests they have provided for a stronger coordinating or central organization. there seems to be rather widespread acceptance of the view that increased effectiveness has been achieved as a result. (3) a basic principle that seems essential to progress in this area is recognition of the autonomous role of the various societies that whatever cooperation is achieved may create stronger channels of communication, the stimulation of more active development, a central voice, and central services, but cannot in any way alter the independence of action, prestige, and recognition of the individual groups. organization for improved cooperation some other questions need consideration in discussing increased cooperation among statistical societies, and have received some attention. some of these include the following: (1) should a relatively weak central organization or a strong one be created? we might have a committee or association which exists and meets, but with little staff, to serve as a communication and clearance medium among the societies, and as a channel for some types of communication between the societies and outside activities. alternatively, we might have a strongly staffed and aggressive group, with strong professional and administrative leadership, and with resources in time and money to carry out programs, obtain grants of funds, encourage and promote new activities, etc. (2) to what extent should such a central organization be a national or an international organization? as i understand it, asa today is broader than a united states organization, perhaps is better regarded as a north organization, serving in particular statisticians in the united states and canada, but with a considerable number of members throughout the world. is this the character that should be retained in a proposed central organization? it might be national or might have even a broader international role. in the latter event, could it also have a recognized authority to appoint national committees or groups to serve national purposes? (3) should a central or coordinating organization or group be only an organization of societies, an organization of individual people as members, or both? this, i suppose, should depend on the conclusion, to be reached after further discussion, regarding which services are to be provided. it appears that an organization of societies can be most effective in accomplishing some of the functions that have been discussed. perhaps it will be stronger, financially and otherwise, if it provides services both to societies and to individual members. this latter pattern has been followed in the case of a number of other groups, but organizations of societies have also been followed. at least this is an area for consideration and further discussion. (4) should the instrument for achieving a coordinated society be the statistical association, or should a new organization be created, such as a committee on statistics? asa now has a central role, and has a staff of some strength, although it is inadequately staffed and supported for carrying the role that seems needed. in fact, asa is to a considerable extent providing the needed leadership, general representation, and stimulation of cooperation. also, we have seen that asa membership has a wide diversity of interests and represents statisticians working in the various areas of statistical development and application. moreover, statisticians with a primary interest in a specialized field seem particularly likely to be members of asa if they also have a broader interest in statistical developments and applications. an effective organization, supported by strong staff and other resources, may be expensive and difficult to accomplish if we continue to use and to strengthen the asa organization and also attempt to create another one. an attempt to build another staff and organization in addition to that of asa would seem doomed to ineffectiveness unless it took over asa functions, resources, and staff. asa is the organization in which statisticians communicate primarily with statisticians, rather than with mathematicians or subject matter specialists. in my opinion, a step that weakens asa, unless it at the same time replaces it with a clearly strengthened general statistical organization, would serve to decrease rather than increase the effective support of statistics. moreover, it would appear that a stronger organization could most easily be achieved by appropriately modifying asa in whatever respects seem desirable. alternatively, perhaps an overall coordinating organization could be created to to serve as a policy board, depending upon asa staffing and instruments to carry out its roles. it seems to me that an approach that involves either adapting asa or utilizing asa staff and other resources to serve the broader functions, holds considerable promise and should receive serious consideration and attention. need for continued efforts in aba finally, i should like to make a few remarks about the program of asa and its relationship to future developments of a central or coordinating organization, whatever form it might take inside or outside the structure of the statistical association. there is sometimes a tendency already observable in some of our own actions and programs' (1 suppose this may be true in other societies, also), to put off steps that we might take provided such steps might be affected by or have some effect on the discussions of a coordinated approach. there is a tendency to postpone and await developments of the contemplated discussions. i think that such procrastination can be only a setback to statistics and to the areas of endeavor in which statistics is increasingly of vital importance, and that we should proceed aggressively and as effectively as we know how in the various programs of this association, by taking various steps such as those mentioned earlier, as they seem to be needed. at the same time, it seems to me we should cooperate and participate to the fullest in discussions among statistical societies on what needs to be done and what steps should be taken in arriving at a stronger and more coordinated effort in the area of statistics.",169,27.3609467455621,5.31185121107266,0.217776816608997,4624,1007,21.2590131754059,16.2590131754059,58,1.92472184894446,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1961.10482085"

Gainsbrugh","1940-1969","three presidents of this association within the past decade have devoted their annual addresses to the problems arising from this nation's increased reliance upon statistics in decision making in both the public and private sectors. just nine years ago, aryness joy wickens began her historic commentary by stressing the heavy responsibilities this dependence upon statistics in turn placed upon this association and its members: ""in the past few year, statistics in the united states have come to be used as determinants of private and public actions affecting the fortunes of millions of our fellow citizens. as such, they have captured the interest and have become the concern of many who were previously unaware of statistics. ""this development has come so suddenly and spread in so many fields of activity that the statistical profession as a whole seems almost unaware of what is happening. as a profession, we are scarcely prepared, and certainly not organized, to meet the serious responsibilities placed upon us by the new uses of statistics.'"" three years later ralph j. watkins opened his annual message by recalling this association's early link with political arithmetic, citing the society's first publication in 1843 in which statistics was defined as ""the ascertaining and the bringing together of those facts which are fitted to illustrate the conditions and prospects of society.""! note the early emphasis not only upon coincidental but also leading indicators and anticipatory or foreshadowing statistics. president watkins cited prophetically the short lived duration and limited intensity of the 1948 1949 and 1953 1954 recessions as demonstrative of a heightened ability to prevent vicious spirals of credit liquidation and major depression. to this earlier testimony can now be added further confirmation in the muted character of the july, 1957 april, 1958 and the may, 1960 february, 1961 recessions. dr. watkins concluded with this charge to the association: ""the sound management of the economy is dependent on good statistical records and on good analysis. ""it is the role of economic statistics and quantitative economic analysis to supply the indispensable guides that watchful vigilance and good management require. it is a not inconsiderable role in the evolution of our society.""! the third in this sequence of annual addresses delivered in 1958 by walter hoadley stressed the rapid growth in the whole broad field of statistics and the organizational problems of splinter groups this posed to the association. most pertinent to my theme, however, were president hoadley's comments on the rapid development and acceptance of the current system of economic intelligence: ""one of the most significant developments in recent years has been the acceptance by the general public of indeed the demand by citizens at large for far more statistical information. at times it seems hard to realize that many widely used current statistical measures and techniques have had their origin within the past two decades, and many older ones have become sufficiently well understood that they can be mentioned without explicit definition in the press, and over radio and tv.... ""i don't mean,"" president hoadley continued, ""to imply that statistics of all types have become a featured attraction for daily living far from it. what i do mean is that the level of literacy and general understanding has advanced so much that it is possible to arouse interest in numerous subjects these days by statistically gathered and appraised facts as well as emotions.""! intensification of public interest in key statistics time has amply documented the far sighted contentions of my predecessors that the shorthand of statistics would be employed ever more widely to convey the story of social, economic and political change here and abroad or in the classical words of 1843 ""to illustrate the condition and prospects of society."" economic statistics have moved from the passing mention they received on the financial pages of the nation's press as late as world war ii to ever greater prominence in today's news section. in the case of such key measures as gross national product, employment and unemployment, and consumer prices, the latest release is often headlined on the front page of the metropolitan press and becomes a bannerhead at times of business cycle turning points. columnists and editorial writers feed upon the latest crop of statistical releases. battle is frequently joined over the interpretation to be accorded the most recent figures by statisticians and economists in and out of governmental office, via the ""letter to the editor"" column. weekly and monthly magazines have also discovered the intensity of interest of young and old alike of both sexes in the course of human events as entered in the statistical record. television and radio, too, seize upon the latest statistic and give it circulation, with necessarily the least conditioning of any medium of communication. the key statistics have also become essential ingredients in political debate. the result is at times more confusing than enlightening. in the last presidential election the two major candidates relied heavily upon the economic statistics with which they had been supplied to deal with such pivotal issues as comparative rates of economic growth, inter temporally and inter spatially, the depth and probable duration of the then spiraling recession and the past and prospective toll of inflation. even the most sophisticated of statisticians was at times left uncertain, whether the two candidates were drawing their sharply varying interpretations from the same common body of data. in a debate on mounting unemployment in early 1961 between a prominent senator and an equally illustrious cabinet officer, one based his conclusions upon seasonally adjusted data, the second upon the raw statistics; neither seemed at home, at least at that time, with the complexities of the underlying statistics. as late as november, 1961, president kennedy in his press conference stressed the fact that unemployment had dipped below four million, the first month to do so this year. seasonally adjusted, however, the total was 4.8 million, the same as in september and only modestly below the 5 million unemployed at the recession's trough. international comparisons, another favorite diversion of late, are all too frequently achieved through the use of the shorthand of statistics, as if the conventions of record keeping were universal. they are for some, as in the case of national accounts, through the good offices of the united nations. even so, the all too frequent contrast of low per capita incomes of the emerging, less industralized nations with their more mature counterparts is not without severe limitations because of the conventions employed that bar the income arising within the family or household. similar hazards surround the quick andready comparisons of savings investment among the various nations. even more intransigent is the problem of rendering international measures of unemployment comparable since many other countries rely upon their official unemployment register rather than leaving, as we do, the determination of employment status optional with the survey respondent. i was delighted with the papers presented by the president's panel recently on the adequacy of unemployment statistics. the five participants agreed that the united states has the best reporting of employment and unemployment in the world. i thought they were also in agreement that, good as the figures are, they are not good enough for the uses we now wish to make of them, particularly with respect to the degree of optional as distinct from involuntary unemployment currently prevailing. the challenge of better public understanding within less than a generation we have created a system of economic intelligence, as the three presidents i have cited so correctly observed, that is not only rich in scope beyond any historical precedent, but that has also gained widespread public acceptance. as custodians of that system, we owe its ever larger public a better understanding of those measures than has thus far been achieved. such understanding as currently exists tends, in my judgment, toward the inadequate and superficial, thereby lending itself to demagogic abuse. the limited knowledge possessed by the coming generation of the derivation and meaning of the statistics we live by stands in striking contrast to the heavy reliance they as tomorrow's citizens will be placing upon these statistical governors. in a world in which economic statistics have become the trigger figures for action there are disturbing, if not tragic, overtones in the dearth of information our people, particularly those approaching voting age, possess about these key measures. in the early 1960's, it would still appear that only about one of every ten high school students is exposed to an economics course and that is more likely to deal with business law, current events and economic history and geography than with indoctrination in the derivation and meaning of key statistics upon which these youngsters will be basing decisions affecting their occupational choices, their income, their taxes and savings and even their ballots. in our rush to develop and articulate the framework of economic intelligence, we have been too quick to assume a higher level of statistical literacy and of general public understanding than the facts warrant. many texts, perhaps too many, are now devoted to the fields of statistical techniques, sampling procedures and the impressive mathematical contributions of the past quarter century from which the statistician has so richly benefitted. few, indeed, are the contributions devoted to placing before the lay consumer the descriptive, qualitative, conceptual materials that are prerequisites to assure an adequate understanding of the statistics we live by. as of today, i can report a virtual void of text material for the class i teach dealing with current economic statistics at new york university. helpful as is the text i have employed for the past decade, ""government statistics for business use,"""" it is at best a makeshift, to be pieced out with descriptive materials assembled from numerous other sources. even the sophisticated user of accounts knows that there is no easy path through the jungle of descriptive literature in which are hidden the details on weighting, classification, conventions, imputations and the myriad qualifications with which each key statistic is surrounded. nowhere is it more true, literally, that research is more a matter of footwork than of headwork than when it becomes necessary on occasion to delve into the specific, minute detail of the derivation of any current key statistic. the statistical fraternity has been fortunate indeed in the quick and widespread public acceptance of its products. there are several disturbing signs of late, however, that the general public may again be developing a growing skepticism about the degree of confidence it can continue to place in such data. such measures as unemployment, price trends, national output and even the population count have come under attack thus far this decade. much of this arises from lack of understanding of the purpose and basic conceptual approach underlying these measurements. i am hopeful this association will take up the challenge of educating this nation with its penchant for figures into the nuances of the statistics we live by. the data we compile have never been more universally followed than they now are. each of us can wrestle with his own conscience in replying to the inevitable corollary to such an observation: are they better and more widely understood? even more in point how well are they understood by the young who in their formative years have been so favorably impressed by the technical and mechanical advances in statistics? this challenge is put in a broader and more forthright fashion by henry t. heald, president of the ford foundation: ""twenty years ago such matters as nuclear energy, economic growth, demography, automation and territorial sovereignty were largely the province of graduate seminars. today they are plainly in the public domain. specialists may recoil at the layman's inadequacy to weigh these matters, but the public, you know, does not wait for a certificate of competence before it dares think and act on matters affecting its welfare. ""in a free society the responsibility of a scholar does not end in the office of his peers and the pages of his journal. if his inquiries seem clothed with meaning for mankind, he has an obligation to keep an eye cocked toward the course they take. the more specialized his field, the greater the obligation, for there are few like him who can comprehend the subject to its roots."" dr. heald not only points up the responsibility of the scholar but also suggests a course of action designed to meet this obligation that to me seems particularly applicable to this association's activities. ""although there are still some gaps in knowledge relating to many old and new problems besetting mankind,"" he rightfully observes, ""some fields may have been plowed too often, and further tilling will bring only marginal return while other soil remains unexplored and uncultivated. all too often less prestige is attached to the synthesis of existing knowledge than to the pursuit of new facts, even minutiae. some of the best minds might more profitably be put to the task of synthesis and communication which can be as challenging and creative as original discovery or speculation.... in our time some of the most significant advances in knowledge at the service of mankind may come from increased concentration on the process of communicating knowledge.""? a note on student literacy in economic statistics how well informed are the people about the economic statistics they live by? an intensive search of what little has been collected on this question was most disappointing. the materials turned up were primarily designed to highlight the need for broader education in economics rather than to test the levels of literacy about key economic statistics. the national task force on economic education in its most recent report concluded that ""every informed citizen should be familiar with these two measures of the nation's total output and income"" [gnp and national income]. it also stressed the need to distinguish between changes arising from price variation as distinct from volume. this is, in essence, the extent of their discussion of economic statistics. on the somewhat encouraging side is a study of the degree of economic sophistication conducted by the banker's association to determine how high to pitch the content of a paper they were preparing on inflation. they found the average quite well informed on matters of price, government spending, taxation and the banking system. this impression derives from the character and tenor of responses to various questions on which they were surveyed. when asked what they thought was the main function of the federal reserve system, for example, and then given a range of multiple choice answers, their responses fell with highest frequency on the best choice; i.e., controlling the supply of credit and monetary stability. similarly, when asked how they were affected by inflation, most of those who believed they were affected said that it reduced the value or purchasing power of their incomes. even this study, however, did not provide any direct measure of statistical literacy in economics, although the results by inference seem to reflect an awareness of the key statistics governing the economy. by way of a limited pilot study a test was made early this fall of the extent of knowledge of the values of some of the major indicators most frequently employed in economic analysis, with the aid of two of my younger colleagues at new york university."" some two hundred undergraduate students in economics and statistics were asked to indicate the current value (or position) of gross national product, the index of industrial production, the consumer price index, the percentage of the labor force unemployed and, finally, as supplementary evidence, the size of the national debt. the results indicate a definite lack of knowledge about these strategic measures all the more disturbing in that the sample polled was preponderantly of economics students! no single yardstick is more frequently used to convey to the general public the current position of the economy than the gross national product. only ten of this seemingly better informed group came up with a close approximation ($511 billion $520 billion) of the then prevailing annual rate of output. only half of the responses fell between $400 billion and $580 billion. the remaining half either obviously lacked any semblance of working knowledge of this strategic statistic or failed to respond. the index of industrial production is another measure widely circulated and universally followed in business and financial circles. it is one of the older measures in today's tool kit of economic indicators and hence might have acquired a more informed following by virtue of age. yet only six of the respondents placed its value accurately (111 114, 1957= 100), and nearly two thirds of the undergraduates felt they were not qualified to answer. in some responses, despite the fact that the form indicated 1957= 100, the figures supplied ranged as low as 50, indicating little if any acquaintance with index number techniques. prices have of late been the stuff of which news is made. from the prominence given, in the boldest of headlines, to a change of as much as a tiny fraction of a point up or down, one might assume fairly widespread knowledge of this statistic. in all, 26 students approximated the correct figure (126 130, with 1957 = 100), but again fully half failed to respond at all. unemployment, too, has figured much in public and political discussion. here perhaps the range of responses is revealing, without further comment. only 14 failed to respond, the lowest nonresponse total for any measure. the correct figures, between 6.6% 7.0%, were given in 25 instances. over 50 felt the toll of unemployment was between 4.1% 5.0%. finally, 31 undergraduates, • the assistance is gratefully acknowledged of edward greenblatt and robert winters, both of the school of commerce, accounts, and finance, new york university. some in elementary and some in advanced economics and statistics courses, put the rate of unemployment above 10.6 percent. as for national debt, little comfort can be found here in terms of lay recognition of the pertinent dimensions. about a fourth of those responding placed the total at less than $60 billion; 103 responded below the actual figure, $281 billion$300 billion; 31 answered correctly; 27 put the debt above its actual total, while 62 failed to reply. i do not propose to make more of these results than this sample experiment warrants, but the test does bear out bits and pieces of evidence offered elsewhere as to the limited awareness of key statistics even for those measures repeatedly noted in the daily press and other media of communication. if this be the level of awareness for indicators much in vogue, what are the coefficients of literacy for the host of other measures essential to a popular understanding of trends in our times? can we hope to achieve the proper decisions essential to balanced economic growth when such a high degree of unfamiliarity prevails relative to bodies of highly publicized data? how accurate can be the knowledge of other meaningful but less heralded measures such as average hourly and weekly earnings, distributive shares of wages and profits, concentration of income and wealth, comparative tax burdens by income classes, and growth rates of this and other economic systems? toward heightened statistical awareness not only is the need clearly evident for action by the association on this educational front, but the times are also propitious for such a move. we are currently witnessing a ground swell of professional and public interest in investment in human resources, particularly in the form of education. the pattern of investment has already swung markedly toward research and development, so much so that such outlays are now being increasingly viewed as warranted inclusions under both public and private capital formation."" the next step may be to embrace investment in human capital. under this heading, empirical data have already been developed on the relationship of investment in human resources in general, and in education specifically, to economic growth and productivity, a drive by this association to raise the levels of literacy relative to economic statistics is a necessary complement to this upsurge of both business and professional interest in the broader field of economic education. as robert l. darcy of ohio university recently observed, ""something should and can be done to improve a condition in the crucial [economic] 'principles' course (and in economic education generally) that has for too long bordered on the shameful. ""10 only the traditional restraints surrounding this occasion have kept me from using equally unbridled language relative to the inadequacy of knowledge of the statistics we live by, especially among undergraduates and high school students. in much the same way that the current activities of the association's business & eco • see national science foundation, ""research and development and the gross national product, economic statistics section highlight the statistical measurement of economic phenomena, so, too, do i believe this effort should be concurrent with, but independent of, the national task force on economic education. the primary emphasis should in my judgment be upon the concept, derivation, content, and trend of the key measures, rather than upon the more thorny and controversial questions of interpretation that are bound to assume major importance in the economics curriculum. my specific recommendations for association action are three fold in number: 1. enlist the aid of the business & economic statistics section and the section on training to develop a basebook that can be used at the high school level to acquaint tomorrow's citizens with the key statistical indicators. the office of statistical standards several years ago began to press federal agencies to provide just such descriptive material for the more important official series. much of the material currently contained in the ""supplement to economic indicators, historical and descriptive background"" lends itself to this purpose."" amplified with simple charts and with appendix matter containing such specifics as weighting schemes, size of sample, major conventions, bibliography of related descriptive materials, etc., this could well become collateral reading for the forthcoming economics text being prepared by the national task force. 2. create with the aid of the office of statistical standards an advisory committee on economic source books. currently each governmental agency largely goes its own way in terms of providing descriptive and historic materials for the area it covers. there is no standard library of descriptive works to which the serious student can turn for ready reference. since change quickly renders virtually obsolete all such attempts, the proposed advisory committee should be asked to consider both (a) what should be added to the presently inadequate library of detailed descriptive matter on the derivation of the principal economic measures, and (b) how best to keep current a perpetual inventory of such materials. this is a pressing need that goes largely unmet and, as a result, the practitioners in the field are often compelled to use new data on faith, awaiting the subsequent release of the background papers. conceivably, a looseleaf system might be devised that would readily permit new matter as it appeared to be added to the standard reference library. the creation of this body of reference material might, in turn, stimulate various members of the association to prepare much needed texts for use in secondary schools and by undergraduates. 3. third and last in the drive to promote more widespread understanding of the statistics we live by would be the development of a series of television programs devoted exclusively to this subject. the association would enlist the services of its fellows in government, business, labor and the universities in these presentations. aid should be readily forthcoming from the various research institutions such as the national bureau of economic research, the twentieth century fund, the brookings institution, and the national industrial conference board. here again the emphasis from the outset would be upon descriptive content, upon concept, techniques, limitations and reservations rather than upon interpretation of present or potential areas of controversy. where particular problem areas might emerge, as in the measurement of productivity, the basis for controversy would be explored, but such matters should be treated as peripheral rather than central. unlike the association's earlier and highly successful venture into television, this series of programs should be keyed to the secondary schools rather than addressed to a college or university audience. what is being sought is mass understanding of the basic measures in today's system of economic intelligence, in the belief that such knowledge will contribute toward citizen, consumer, labor management decisions more closely in keeping with the national interest. through the use of tape or film, such programs might be made available at a modest fee for use in secondary schools, thereby providing the association with some continuing return on its initial investment. from conversations i have had with industrial relations officers, such a film library would fill the need for nonpartisan, factual material of high professional caliber for use in programs of economic education within the plant or enterprise. these, admittedly, are but the first few steps toward gaining more widespread public understanding of the statistics we live by. all members of the statistical profession, irrespective of their particular field of specialization, have a vital stake in keeping the public's confidence in statistics high. the proposed program thus serves both our mutual professional interest and an even more essential national purpose!",152,27.9144736842105,5.18548197030403,0.323591798255951,4243,1373,20.4870760354516,15.4870760354516,76,0.418768254640367,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1962.10482146"

Hauser","1940-1969","some years ago, in helping to present the budget of the bureau of the census to a sub committee of the house appropriations committee, i was asked by a congressman strategically placed to influence the course and development of government statistics ""if business has been able to get along for 150 years without statistics, why does it need them now?"" [8, p. 1]. it is of crucial importance, not only to statisticians as a professional group, but to all other segments of contemporary society to face and to attempt to answer this question. it is even more important to attempt to answer the broader question: why does society now need a vast array of statistical activities when in prior centuries it was able to get along with little or virtually none? tonight i shall take advantage of the opportunity afforded me to attempt to answer these questions before this captive audience brought together by a common interest in statistics an audience with additional primary or secondary interests whether they be in sociology, as mine are; or in economics, or in business, or in natural science, or in mathematics, or in teaching, or in some other professional field. permit me to begin with an elementary perspective. man has inhabited this globe for a minimum of 200,000 years and, perhaps, as long as two million years or more. recent finds by the british anthropologist leakey [11] indicate that close relatives of man wandered over the earth as long as 14 million years ago. over almost all of this vast span of time there was no field of statistics and, perhaps happily, there were no statisticians. for most of the time that man has been on this earth he has been a nomad. permanent human settlement was not possible until after the great advances of the neolithic revolution some 10,000 years ago. these included the domestication of plants and animals which made it unnecessary for man to chase his food supply and to the elaboration of the crafts [15, pp. 51 67]. moreover in addition to these and other technological developments, man, over the years, achieved cultural, intellectual, and moral advances which were also preconditions for permanent human settlement manifest in various forms of social organization and social control. the size that a human settlement could reach was a function of three major factors environment, technology, and social organization. the neolithic village never achieved a size of more than a few hundred persons at most. in europe the largest pre historic village yet known barkaer in jutland had only 52 small one room dwellings. sixteen to 30 houses were the more usual, setting an upper limit to population varying from about 200 to some 400 persons [2, p. 6]. the small size of the neolithic village arose from the need for people to live within easy walking distance of areas under cultivation with primitive agricultural methods. thus, when population growth exceeded the capacity of the land within ready walking distance, the village grew through fission a new settlement had to be formed. at the outset all members of the peasant neolithic village were primarily cultivators. non agricultural specialists were not possible until the combination of technological and social organizational developments resulted, on the one hand, in a food surplus and, on the other, in some method of effecting an exchange relationship between the cultivator and the non agricultural specialist. among the early specialists were the ruler, the priest, and the craftsman. some of these experts could not be supported at the outset by anyone village alone. they could make a living, apparently, only by traveling a circuit; and indeed this pattern of activity has been observed among the maori in more recent times [2, p. 7]. continued technological and organizational developments made possible the city a population clumping many times the size of any known neolithic village. the city first appeared about 5500 years ago. turner traces some of the highlights of its emergence from the peasant village of the neolithic period in mesopatamia, india, egypt, and crete [15, chs. ii vi]. the city may be distinguished from the village by its relatively large size, the full time specialist freed from food production, and the presence of organizational development which permitted the storing and allocation of food surplus [2, pp. 12 ff.]. for storage and allocation of surplus, record keeping was necessary. hence, the early civilizations in which the city first appeared developed systems of writing and of numerical notation. these inventions in turn contributed greatly to the growth of larger cities. systems of writing and numerical notation were a pre condition for science and its auxiliaries arithmetic, geometry, and mathematics in general. numerical notation made possible measurement with scales other than the nominal scale. continued developments in mathematics and in measurement played a major role in advances in knowledge and in the invention of science physical, biological and, more recently, social. the development of writing and numerical notation, essential to the keeping of records for the storing and allocation of food surpluses, had far reaching consequences. the collection and allocation of food surpluses were accomplished through the ruler, who in ancient times often combined with his temporal powers the authority of the supernatural, as in ancient egypt. record keeping, which facilitated the performance of this function, also contributed to other important governmental activities for domestic and foreign purposes. [2, pp. 12 fi.] it made possible the count, recruitment, organization and utilization of able bodied men for police and military purposes and also for the levying and collection of taxes. the emergence of systems of writing and of numerical notation antedated by far the appearance of statistics and statisticians. literacy and counting ability for most of the time that man has lived in cities were in themselves forms of specialization. this is apparent even as recently as in our own national history. in a memorial to the congress which reached the senate on january 10, 1800, the philosophical society, through its president, thomas jefferson, petitioned for the expansion of census statistics and included reference to the need for occupational information. jefferson wrote: "" .. in order to ascertain more completely the causes which influence life and health, and to furnish a curious and useful document of society in these states, and of the conditions and vocations of our fellow citizens"" .. a table was to specify ""the number of free male inhabitants, of all ages, engaged in business, under the following or such other descriptions as the greater wisdom of the legislature shall approve, to wit: (1) men of the learned professions, including clergymen, lawyers, physicians, those employed in the fine arts, teachers, and scribes in general,"" [20, p. 19, italics added]. jefferson then continued to list eight other categories of occupations. thus, to read and write in the united states in 1800 was to have a ""learned profession."" men of letters, those who could write, read, and reckon, were in their origin associated with the aristocratic ruling group. the term ""statistics"" referred to ""matters of state,"" reflecting the early relationship between record keeping and the performance of state functions. the term ""statists"" was, in fact, sometimes used for statisticians during the 19th century. the statistical society of london in 1884 for its jubilee session asked that the views of ""foreign statists"" be ascertained [13, p. 5]. it took the same social, economic, and political developments that led to the undermining of the feudalistic and aristocratic orders and the emergence of a democratic society for the skill of the scribe to become widely diffused through the general population. moreover, it took the complex developments, technological and social, which make up the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and scientific revolutions to produce the mammoth cities and metropolitan areas of the contemporary world, and, with them, the greatly increased specialization, including considerable differentiation of ""scribes in general."" the statistician may be regarded as one of the forms of specialization of the general function of the scribe. this is neither the time nor the place to attempt the full tracing of events which produced the statistician, but i should like to present some highlights of these developments and a framework borne of ""human ecological"" considerations for understanding them. for purposes of exposition, i shall use the phrase ""social morphological revolution"" to stand for what i am about to describe. this is in keeping with the best academic traditions for scholars, seeking a short descriptive phrase for a chapter title or book title, after all, are, responsible for the invention of the various ""revolutions"" the ""agricultural revolution,"" the ""commercial revolution,"" the ""industrial revolution,"" the ""scientific revolution"" and the like. i cannot claim complete credit for this neologism, for it was emile durkheim writing in the 19th century who made much of ""social morphology"" as a key to understanding the nature of society and social behavior. [4, bk. ii, ch. ii]. the ""social morphological revolution,"" as i am using the term, refers to the basic changes in the size and density of human settlement over time and the consequences of these changes. it is a way of summarizing quantitatively the transition from nomadic existence to neolithic village living to town life and, finally, to urban and metropolitan patterns of living. durkheim has stated that: ""social life rests on a substratum whose size as well as its form is determined. this substratum is constituted by the mass of individuals who make up society, the way in which they are distributed on the soil, and the nature and configuration of all sorts of things that affect collective relationships. the social substratum differs according to whether the population is large or small and more or less dense, whether it is concentrated in cities or dispersed over the countryside, how cities and houses are constructed, whether the area occupied by the society is more or less extensive, and according to the kind of boundaries that delimit it."" [3, pp. 9 10j. in elaboration of this keen observation of durkheim's, let us consider the differences in potential social interaction in a community with a fixed land area but varying population density. let the land area be that which lies within a circle with a lo mile radius, namely, 314 square miles. in such an area the size of the population under different density conditions is shown below [10, pp. 100 ff ]: population density (population per square mile) 1 50 8,000 17,000 25,000 number of persons circle of to mile radius 314 15,700 2,512,000 5,338,000 7,850,000 the density of one person per square mile is not too far from the density of the united states when occupied by the indians. the density of 50 is approximately that of the united states today, and also of the world as a whole. the density of 8,000, in round numbers, was that of central cities in metropolitan areas in 1950, the density figure of 17,000 was that of chicago in 1950, and the 25,000 density figure that of new york. thus, in aboriginal america the person moving about within a circle of 10mile radius could potentially make only 313 different contacts. in contrast, the density of the u. s. as a whole today would make possible well over 15,000 contacts in the same land area; the density of central cities in the u.s., in 1950, would permit over 2.5 million contacts; the density of chicago over 5.3 million contacts; and the density of new york city about 7.9 million contacts. these differences in density and therefore in potential social interaction necessarily affect the nature of collective activity and social organization.. this simple way of presenting the implications for interaction of differences in size and density of populations underlies and portrays a mutation in social organization and, consequently, in human behavior and thought. the increasing size and concentration of population are responsible for the social mutation the equivalent of a genetic mutation represented by the felicitous phrase of my late colleague louis wirth ""urbanism as a way of life"" [18, part ii, ch.1]. it is my thesis that the social morphological revolution culminating in urbanism as a way of life has, among other things, produced both statistics and statisticians. for the social morphological revolution has produced the ""mass society"" a society in which the nature of human nature and the nature of social organization has been profoundly altered. the multiplier effect of increasing size and density of population on social interaction has produced contacts which are ""secondary"" rather than ""primary"" that is, distant rather than face to face, segmental rather than integral, utilitarian rather than sentimental [18, ibid]. under these conditions, human behavior has tended to become rational rather than traditional, and social control has tended to become formal, effected through law and regulation, rather than informal, operating through the constraint of the folkways and mores. in the mass society, social institutions have become increasingly ""enacted"" rather than ""crescive,"" that is, they are more invented and created by deliberate design rather than the product of gradual development in the history of a culture [14, pp. 53 ff.]. in the mass society, ""bureaucracy"" has become a necessity. ""bureaucracy"" used in the weberian sociological sense [17, ch. viii] does not refer to government bureaus and ""tax eaters"" as elements in the prevalent stereotype of ""big government."" in its sociological connotation, ""bureaucracy"" is a form of indispensable organization in a mass society. bureaucracies are formal organizations designed to achieve specific objectives. bureaucracy is not confined to the political or governmental. there are no sectors of the mass society in which bureaucratic organization does not appear. it is evident in business, in labor, in education, in religion, and in civic, fraternal, recreational, and other voluntary organizations. the essential characteristics of a bureaucracy are contained in four elements: one, in a division of labor and specialization; two, in a hierarchy of authority a well structured system of superordination and sub ordination; three, in an explicit system of fixed rights and obligations; and, four, in consequence of these elements, in an aura of impersonality. although government bureaucracy is but one facet of bureaucratic organization in the mass society, it is a facet of great general significance and, also, of considerable import in the development of statistics and the emergence of the statistician. big government has, as we are all aware, become a matter of basic political cleavage on both the international and the domestic scenes. but the proliferation of government functions and the increased number of government bureaus and employees cannot be regarded as the result of victories or defeats in the political process in accordance with opposing ideologies in respect to the role of government. big government is rather a product of the social morphological revolution an inevitable concomitant of the evolution of the mass society. the record shows, for example, that the functions of government have continuously expanded in the course of our history; and that the expansion has been largely without regard to the political complexion of the party in power or the philosophy of the administration in regard to the role of government [19, ch. xxv; 7, pp. 3 28]. a simple example of this proposition is to be found in the changed role and function of government in respect to the automobile. even if the automobile had been available in colonial america, it is unlikely that local government would have included the contemporary complex of functions relating to it. with the size and density of population in colonial america, it is unlikely that local government would have had to provide for traffic signals, traffic policemen, traffic tickets, traffic courts, and parking meters; let alone off street parking facilities, expressways, and institutions for dealing with traffic accidents ambulance services, emergency medical centers, hospital wards, and morgues. the proliferation of government functions and personnel necessitated by the automobile is a clear cut and by no means unique example of the changes resulting from increased size and density of the population and advancing technology. a few additional examples may serve further to clarify the transformation in the role and function of government in the mass society. certainly there is more than a casual connection between the inability of the family in the contemporary urban order to cope with the problems of urban health hazards, industrial accidents, and unemployment, and the expansion of government functions in the field of public health, workmen's compensation, and unemployment insurance benefits. similarly, the creation of the interstate commerce commission, the federal trade commission, the securities and exchange commission, the council of economic advisors, the atomic energy control commission, the department of health, education and welfare, and the urban renewal administration, are but a few examples, on the federal level, of new government agencies which have been created to perform functions never anticipated by the founding fathers. the expansion of government functions has inexorably led to increased record keeping and to greater need for facts as a guide to policy and action. government agencies have thus played a prominent part in the collection, tabulation, dissemination and use of statistics facts in quantified and organized form. early in the history of the united states, the volume and flow of statistical data were relatively small and there was no or little need for the personnel dealing with statistics to become specialist statisticians. yet by the time the federal government was established in 1789, statistics had already become useful in the conduct of government. to begin with, the federal government inherited an accumulation of statistics from colonial times. for during the colonial period, statistics on population became available from 1610; on the slave trade from 1619 (virginia); on daily wages of workmen from 1621, on weekly basic diets from 1622, on exports and imports from 1697, on bills of credit and treasury notes from 1703. indexes of wholesale prices can be calculated from 1720 and tax collections from 1765. statistics on private insurance date from 1759 [16, ch. z]. of the greatest significance, however, is the fact that the very organization of the federal government was made dependent on a statistical operation a census of population as required decennially by article 1, section 2, of the constitution of the united states. moreover, from the beginning of the activity of the new government, statistics were maintained on such matters as government finances, military personnel, elections, foreign trade, water transport, balance of international payments, postal services, patents, and membership in religious bodies. early in the life of the federal government statistical series began to multiply. data on hay, cotton, and cottonseed acreage production and prices became available from 1790; on gold and silver production from 1792; on iron ore and pig iron production from 1799; on currency stock and currency in circulation from 1800; on public land sales from 1800; on medical schools and dentists from 1810; on banking from 1811; and on immigration from 1820 [16, ch. z]. the development of statistics as a function of advancing technology is evident in the data relating to transport in the u. s. data on water transport are available from 1789, on railroads from 1830, on highways from 1890, on scheduled air transport from 1926. the story is paralleled in the field of communication. postal statistics have been available since 1789, data relating to telegraph and cables from 1866, to telephones from 1876, to radio from 1921, and to television from 1941 [16, ch. z]. perhaps the best single operation in which the expansion of statistics can be traced as a function of social change the increased complexity and interdependence of the social order is in the decennial census of the u. s. the first census, in 1790, was entirely restricted to population and contained only 6 inquiries, including the name of heads of families and items relating to age, sex, and free or slave status. the number of inquiries by 1800 had doubled, although they were still restricted to the same topics age, sex, and free or slave status. by 1820, the inquiries included new topics, indicating the new problems engaging the attention of the congress questions relating to naturalization and to workers in agriculture, commerce, and manufacture. by 1830, the schedule required the reporting of the deaf and dumb and also the blind. in 1840, seven categories of work activity were called for and also information on pensions for ""revolutionary or military services"" [20, pp. 12 39]. incidentally, the 1840 census was the first for which the newly formed statistical association (1839) presented a memorial to the u. s. congress [5, pp. 15 6]. in 1850, with the accelerating tempo of technological and social change, there was a major expansion in census inquiries. the congress required six schedules to be used of which schedule no.1, relating to free inhabitants, was an expanded population schedule. it included questions requiring detailed occupational returns for all males over 15 years of age, the value of real estate owned, place of birth, whether married within the year, school attendance, literacy, and an elaboration of information on physical disabilities. schedule no.2 related to slave inhabitants and called for the names of slave owners and the number of slaves, as well as for information on the characteristics of slaves. schedule no.3 related to mortality, requiring information on the characteristics of all persons who died during the year. schedule no.4 was an agricultural schedule, calling for detailed returns on agricultural production and related items. schedule no.5 was an industrial schedule applying to manufacturing, mining, fisheries and all kinds of ""mercantile, commercial or trading business."" schedule no. 6 called for ""social statistics"" for each political subdivision, including such items as valuation of estate; annual taxes; colleges, academies and schools; seasons and crops; libraries; newspapers and periodicals; religion; pauperism; crime and wages. the census of 1850 may well be regarded as the first u. s. census attuned to the statistical needs of the emerging mass society. it, by the way, in addition to greatly broadening the scope of census inquiries, introduced important changes in census procedures to improve the quality of the data [20, pp. 39 50]. the censuses of 1860 and 1870, in the main, followed the outlines of the census of 1850. but important modifications were made in the 1870 census schedules at the initiative of the superintendent of the census, general francis a. walker. he, by the way, was president of the statistical association from 1883 to 1896. five new inquiries were added to the population schedule, two on place of birth of foreign parents, two on ""constitutional relations"" following the 14th amendment to the constitution (right to vote and its abridgement) and a question on month of birth for persons born during the year. other modifications were made in the census schedules by way of refining the inquiries and dropping or adding questions in accordance with the experience gained in the censuses of 1850 and 1860 [20, pp. 50 7]. the first effort to achieve a quinquennial census was made during the 1870's for a census in 1875. even then, as once again in the present decade, it was felt that census statistics were needed more often than decennially; and, in addition, a census of 1875 would have recorded the centennial of independence. but president grant's recommendation for such a census at the suggestion of superintendent walker was rejected by the congress [20, p. 58]. the census of 1880 employed five schedules, as in 1870, relating to population, agriculture, manufacturers, mortality, and social statistics. population schedule additions included questions on relationship to head of household, marital status, illness as well as disability, and unemployment (months unemployed during the census year). noting only the most important population census changes since, ability to speak english, immigration, tenure of home and veteran status appeared in 1890; farm residence, duration of marriage and fertility in 1900; mother tongue in 1910; value of home and radio set in 1930; internal migration, years of school completed, labor force including employment status, income, usual occupation and social security number in 1940. more detailed income questions were added in 1950; and questions relating to place of work, means of transportation to work, and length of residence in same dwelling unit, in 1960 [20, pp. 58 ff. to census of 1890 and census schedules thereafter]. in addition to these developments in the census of population, provision was made for separate new censuses. the schedules relating to industry, agriculture, and commerce introduced in 1850 may be regarded as the precursors of the census of manufactures initiated in 1904, the quinquennial census of agriculture in 1925, the census of distribution in 1930. the census of religious bodies, not without earlier precedent, was provided for in 1906. the newest of the censuses, in response to a chronic urban plant problem, is the census of housing, first taken in 1940, and a census of transportation will probably be taken in 1963. the full story of the elaboration of the statistical activities of the bureau of the census cannot be related here. but at least mention must be made of the growing importance and greatly expanded size of the current statistical program of the bureau, signaling the increasing recognition of the role of statistics as a form of knowledge for current use, rather than for the historical record. needless to say, the expansion of census activities was paralleled by the elaboration of statistical activities throughout the federal government. in the department of agriculture, the u. s. public health service, and the federal reserve board, highly significant statistical agencies were developed; and, in virtually all departments, statistical activities of some sort were originated or expanded. the need to control, to coordinate, and to integrate federal statistics led to the committee on government statistics in 1933, and, eventually, to the federal reports act in 1941 and to the creation of the office of statistical standards in the bureau of the budget in the executive office of the president of the united states [9, v ff. and p. 1 ff]. nor was the increase in statistics restricted to government alone. there is practically no collective activity in our mass society which does not maintain records from which statistics are a by product. the proliferation of statistics in business has certainly matched that in government, and for similar reasons. highly important private statistical data collecting and publishing efforts include those of the national bureau of economic research, the national industrial conference board, the dodge corporation, standard and poor's, dun and bradstreet, and mcgraw hill. in the field of market statistics and sample surveys, the operations of gallup, roper, audit & surveys, national analysts, the university of michigan survey research center, and the university of chicago national opinion research center loom large. the financial and other pages of the daily newspaper trace some of this development. important areas in which the mushrooming of statistics in the business community is evident include the stock exchanges, the bond market, banking and financial institutions, insurance, trade associations, advertising and market research, and public opinion polls. relatively recent and spectacular expansions of statistics in the private as well as the public sector is afforded by the rapid growth of quality control and operations research methods and their application. space does not permit even the outlining of the way in which statistics have become important elements in policy formation and program administration in the private sectors of the economy and society not only in business but, also, in other areas such as labor, religion, recreation, health, education, and science. the evolution of statistics in the united states in response to the changing social order was, of course, paralleled on the world scene. internationally comparable statistics were compiled in systematic form during the 19th century; and are even now gaining great momentum in the post world war ifworld under the aegis of the united nations and the specialized agencies. just as national statistics developed in response to the need for sound facts in the more complex and interdependent mass society in the u. s., so the evolution of international statistics reflects the growing need for comparable data in the shrinking, and ever more interdependent, world. the u. n. statistical yearbook, the demographic yearbook, and its current publication series, as well as the statistical publications of the specialized agencies (9, ch. 14), will, over time, trace, not only the expansion of international statistics, but, also, the emergence of a world order. this brief overview of the evolution of statistics emphasizes the expanding volumes per se of statistical data collected and utilized in answer to the needs of society. it was with the swelling in the volume of statistical data and the increasing need to effectively and efficiently use them that statistical technology was born and has developed to the point where today we use the term ""method"" to characterize the central core of statistics. and it was these statistics, both as data and method, that, in turn, contributed to the evolving technology and forms of social organization which accelerated the development of the mass society. that is, statistics was, not only a by product of the social morphological revolution, but, also, an essential ingredient of it. as statistics proliferated with the advance of the social morphological revolution, the specialist statistician, of necessity, emerged, and, with him, professional statistical societies. in this country, the statistical association was organized in 1839. this is our 122nd annual meeting. ours, however, was not the first statistical association. statistical societies were founded in saxony in 1831, in manchester in 1833, and in london in 1834 [13, p. 5j. the latter subsequently became the royal statistical society. the need for formal international cooperation in the development of statistics was recognized by adolphe quetelet who was largely responsible for the first international statistical ""congress"" held in brussels in 1853. other congresses were held in paris in 1855, vienna in 1857, london in 1860, berlin in 1863, florence in 1867, the hague in 1869, st. petersburg in 1872, and budapest in 1876 [13, pp. 5 ff.]. these congresses culminated in the founding of the international statistical institute in 1885, largely at the initiative of the statistical society of london in connection with the celebration of the jubilee of its foundation in 1834 [13, pp. 11 ff]. since then many new statistical societies have been organized, both national and international with rapidly growing and increasingly specialized membership. the term ""statistician"" today refers no longer to one type of professional specialist but is, rather, a loose general term which encompasses many forms of specialization as our own organizational problems testify. the professional statistician of today, the product of intensive graduate training, with a ph.d. in statistics or in a discipline in which statistics is applied, although he stands in great contrast to the keeper of records in the ancient city, or to the ""general scribe"" in early history, or the ""statist"" in 19th century europe, is, nevertheless, a lineal descendent of these functionaries. in a fundamental sense, then, the statistician and all other contemporary specialists owe their origin to improvements in food production, more specifically to improvements in irrigation, in cultivation, in stockbreeding, and in fishing all early contributions to the social morphological revolution. for these improvements were preconditions for the emergence of any non agricultural occupations. continued technological development together with advances in social organization led to the sequence of larger population agglomerations, more minute division of labor, and the great profusion of specialists which characterize contemporary society. the specialist statistician owes his existence in a more direct way to the evolution of urban civilization. for the advent of urbanism as a way of life resulted in a greatly increased need for sound factual knowledge as a basis for policy formation and administrative action; and, simultaneously, in the outmoding and breaking down of traditional behavior, so that men's minds have become more receptive to, as well as more dependent on, organized facts as a basis for decision making. it is within the framework of these considerations that the appearance and proliferation of various types of statistics, the evolution of statistical techniques, and the emergence of statistics as a profession are to be understood. it is within this framework that an answer is given to the questions with which this paper began. in 1790, when 95 percent of the population of the united states was rural and only 5 percent urban there were relatively few statistics, there was comparatively little need for statistics, and there were no statisticians. in contrast, today (1960) with 70 percent of the population urban and 63 percent metropolitan, there is a great need for statistics, there are many more statistics, and the volume of statistics is still increasing. moreover, rapid increase in statistical data is a relatively recent phenomenon, for only as recently as 1920 did the census first report half our population resident in urban areas. it is still true that most of the world's peoples ""get along"" without statistics. for, most of the world's population is still resident in rural, economically underdeveloped areas. indeed one of the indicators of an economically backward nation is a dearth of statistical data. the congressman's question is but one evidence of the fact that the role of statistics and of statisticians by reason of the rapidity and recency of its change, is not yet fully understood. the statistician is still the butt of popular humor, signifying his still uncertain position in the public mind. there are some persons prepared to argue that the emergence of the statistician signals the rise of a third and more advanced form of liar. there are many who rail against various aspects of statistics, including even as innocent an item as an average reported in decimals. witness the following: ""the average statistician is married to 1.75 wives who try their level best to drag him out of the house 2i nights a week with only 50 percent success.

Bowman","1940-1969","we are told by our esteemed professor willcox that at its beginning in 1839 the statistical association accepted a definition of statistics nearly identical to that adopted previously by the statistical society of london. that society (later to become the royal statistical society) defined statistics as (‘the ascertaining and bringing together of those ‘facts which are calculated to illustrate the conditions and prospects of society’.” willcox in 1934 noted that by that time statistics had (‘a broader meaning, the numerical study of groups, and a narrower one, the numerical study of social groups.” he ventured the opinion that “whether both will survive or one will supplant the other is still a matter of conjecture.” today there is little doubt that the broader definition is generally accepted. in continental classroom we were told that ‘(statistics is the art and science of gathering, analyzing, and making inferences from data.”2 in another popular modern text we find the definition of statistics as (‘a body of methods for making wise decisions in the face of uncertainty ” i like both of these definitions the former because it stresses the fact that both “art” and “science” are involved, and also because it includes the three elements of gathering, analyzing, and making inferences. i like the second one because it stresses that statistics is a body of methods used under certain circumstances for me as a social scientist the circumstances involve phenomena subject to numerous effects from a variety of factors not subject to experimental control. today statistical methods have won a respected place in almost every field of science, and the term statistician is coming more and more to refer to persons specializing in developing such methods or employing them in various subject matter fields. thus, the terms statistics and statistician when used to indicate a field of science and practitioners of that science need no longer be universally hyphenated with another subject field. yet it is still true, and likely to remain so, that in some instances statistical methods must be developed with specific relevance to subject fields, in these cases the statistician must have competence both in statistical methodology and in the fields of application. the statistics specialist, unhyphenated, has come to stay, but the hyphen connecting statistics to a substantive field is also likely to remain important. we are all aware of this coming of age of statistical science as a general method of analysis, and i need not dwell on it longer. this evening i am going to emphasize one aspect of a more restricted and more historical concept of statistics. this is the area of the social sciences and official statistics which is the field of my own particular interest and competence. my topic is the improvement of federal statistics for use in economic and social analysis and the relationship of the statistical association to such improvements and to the general development of statistical science. what is said here will reflect the significant contribution which asa has made and is making to improvement in federal statistics and will underline the importance of continuing such aid. i shall also argue, however, that the newer areas of statistical methodology and their development, and the application of such methodology to a variety of fields other than those of social aggregates, must be given equal attention. my objective here is to develop certain aspects of a philosophy to guide the growth of asa and related statistical societies in their efforts to promote statistical science. first, i want to take a few minutes to recapture for you some of the enthusiasms, particularly of the late 18th and early 19th century, which provided a relatively few individuals with a new vision for the social sciences and, in part at least, brought about the birth of statistics as a study of social groups. it was these forces which gave impetus to the formation of our statistical association. the basis for scientific study of society was clearly set forth by karl pearson in his grammar of science, near the close of the 19th century. i can still re member the thrill with which i first read this book. many times since then i have reflected that its impact was a truly major one on the whole body of thought in the social sciences at least through the 1930’s. yet its message was fairly elementary “the unity of all science consists alone in its method, not in its material.”* certainly, starting earlier, but seen with greater clarity as we approach the 20th century, a new outlook on the world was being accepted. all phenomena physical and social were open to scientific inquiry. and what was science? not merely a body of organized knowledge at least this was not the most essential aspect but a method a way of finding out how to know. and statistics and statistical methods were to be part of that way of knowing. parts of the first and second paragraph of pearson’s introductory chapter will serve to show what the careful building up of “fact” rather than “romance” was expected to do for the growth of the social sciences. much of this now seems somewhat naive, since we have come to recognize that the development of the social sciences requires this but also much more. ”within the past forty years (first edition 1892) so revolutionary a change has taken place in our appreciation of the essential facts in the growth of human society, that it has become necessary not only to rewrite history, but to profoundly modify our theory of life and gradually, but none the less certainly, to adapt our conduct to the novel theory. the insight which the investigations of darwin, seconded by the suggestive but far less permanent work of spencer, have given us into the development of both individual and social life, has compelled us to remodel our historical ideas and is slowly widening and consolidating our standards. “if we have learnt, it may be indirectly, from the writings of darwin that the methods of production, the mode of holding property, the forms of marriage, the organizations of the family and of the commune are the essential factors which the historian has to trace in the growth of human society; if in our history books we are ceasing to head periods with the names of monarchs and to devote whole paragraphs to their mistresses, still we are far indeed from clearly grasping the exact interaction of the various factors of social evolution, or from understanding why one becomes pre dominant at this or that epoch.” it is these ideas which were important elements in the mushroom growth of statistical societies on both sides of the atlantic in the second and third decades of the 19th century. the first 76 years of asa it is almost always important to examine the past in order to better under stand the present and anticipate the future. let me, then, at this point describe and attempt to capture some of the romance in the history of our association during its first 75 years the period prior to world war i. i have two purposes first, to call attention to much that is interesting and not well known and second, and perhaps more important, to note the almost exclusive attention to promoting data about society. this was in line with the new outlook on science and the world generally which i sketched in my introductory remarks. our association was founded in boston in 1839 “for the purpose of collecting, preserving, and diffusing statistical information, in the different departments of human knowledge.” it still operates under a charter issued by the state of massachusetts, february 5, 1841. an asa historian has noted that “at that time the professional statistician was not, and the statistical output almost negligible. ’’6 certainly in the period before world war i the association was largely concerned with improvements and use of official statistics, with considerable emphasis on vital statistics. in the early days the association met quarterly (even throughout the civil war). the early addresses at these quarterly meetings dealt with “statistics of pauperism, of crime, of immigration, of the massachusetts population, etc. some bore curious titles statistics of the number and kind of carriages in massachusetts in 1756.” another gave statistics of the funeral charges in the interment of governor winslow in 1680, and once, when there must have been a dearth of statistical material, someone read a paper on a tornado that had disturbed the calm of medford. and then our asa historian makes a statement in 1914 that really has no time reference: “not all who dived into the uncharted statistical seas brought up a perfect pearl. some of us fail to do so now, ”’ the association during its early years was also active in fields other than essay writing. it worked with the states particularly massachusetts and with the federal government particularly the census and the treasury for “improving the sources of statistical knowledge.’’ early emphasis was on vital statistics. it may be pertinent to note that not until 1933 was it possible to include all states in the national registration area for births and deaths. while most states had laws requiring registrations, they were not observed uniformly and many states could not meet one of the conditions for inclusions; namely, a demonstrated registration completeness of at least 90 percent. our system of registration of marriages and divorces still does not include all states in a national registration area only 35 states are covered for marriages and only 22 for divorces. following the civil war the range of topics with which the association was concerned broadened. papers were read on statistics of commerce, finance, agri culture, and taxation as well as on population, immigration, and mortality. occasionally consideration was given to statistical method. the early history of the association indicates the influence of individuals, beginning with lemuel shattuck, the prime mover in the founding of the association. joseph b. felt was the recording secretary during the early years 1839 1858. dr. george c. shattuck was president from 1846 to 1851. he was followed by dr. edward jarvis who served as president of the association for 31 years 1852 1882. carroll d. wright and francis a. walker became influential in the association during and following the last decade of jarvis as president. wright served as chief of the massachusetts bureau of statistics of labor from 1873. he relinquished the post in 1888, three years after his appointment by president arthur as the first commissioner of labor when the bureau of labor was established in the department of the interior. francis walker was a professor of political economy and history at yale university and later (1881 1897) president of m.i.t. it was during this period that university teachers were attracted to the association and the association’s interests broadened further. walker served as president for 14 years, 1883 1896. it was under his administration that the journal of the statistical association was started in 1888. he was succeeded by carroll wright, who served as president for 13 years, 1897 1909. it was not until nearly the end of wright’s term of office that the association began the practice of a “presidential address” at its annual meetings. whether by happy coincidence or design, this practice was started at the same time as that of electing a different president each year, thus sparing both presidents and listening members the risk of repeated exposure. wright’s presidential ad dress dealt with the history of the association and with observations on the development of official statistics during the period. most of the presidential addresses to 1914 dealt with problems of promoting or improving official statistics or the use of such statistics in economics and sociology. john koren in his address in 1914 introduced certain ideas which were to receive attention in the years to come; namely, the need for training of statisticians, need for improving the organization of federal statistics, and a proposal that congress establish a “central statistical commission.” a commemorative volume to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the american statistical association had been arranged for in 1914. this enterprise was delayed because of world war i but in 1918 it was finally published under the editorship of john koren as the history of statistics, their development and progress in many countries. its title might easily be misinterpreted today since it actually consists of separate chapters on the development of official statistics in each of the countries of the world for which articles could be secured and makes virtually no mention of statistical methods. i have selected two statements in this volume to show, first, the enthusiasm which continued with respect to statistics as then conceived (i think the ideas of pearson shine through or perhaps spencer) ; and second, the characteristics of statistical organization in government at that time. the first statement was written by s. n. d. north, president of the association in 1910. i quote:s “the science of statistics is the chief instrumentality through which the progress of civilization is now measured, and by which its development hereafter will be largely controlled. “until this science was evolved, history was little more than tradition trans scribed; myths reduced to records “within a short period of time, this new science of statistics has been so effectively organized as to afford a surer horoscope of the future than any agency that has heretofore existed “some of us have faith to believe that the day of universal justice is coming to the world. and that in the end it will make international war impossible. we recognize no agency more effective to this end than the statistical method ” thus in 1914 north’s enthusiasm for statistics seemed unbounded, at a time when the profession, as measured by asa membership, was still extremely limited. asa included 681 on its rolls in 1914, a notable increase from the five staunch souls of 1839, but representing only a modest increase during the third quarter century of the association’s existence. the second set of quotes refers to official statistics and statisticians in the early days and was written by general walker.9 ‘“a strong passion for statistics early developed itself in the life of our people, , no government in the world has ever lavished money and labor more generously upon statistical inquiry, nor has any people ever responded more cheerfully and patiently in this respect therefore, i repeat, we of the united states can at least claim for our statistics that in the matter of good intentions, whether we consider the liberality of the government, the zeal of our working statisticians, or the public spirit of our people, no nation has more to boast of.’” the second statement is from his address before this association in washington “ ‘i do not know of a single man now holding, or who has ever held, a position in this country as the head of a statistical bureau, or as chief of a statistical service, or as a statistician, who had any elementary training for his work. all those who have had anything to do with statistics came into the service comparatively late in life, without any elementary training, sometimes taking up the most gigantic piece of work, the service even extending over this entire country, with its twenty, thirty, fifty, seventy millions of people, and two or three millions of square miles, simply with an interest in the subject as the only guarantee of their competency.’” i shall refer later to the sharp contrast between the situation described by general walker in 1896 and that existing in 1963. it should be remembered that by 1914 where i have arbitrarily ended my (‘early history,” the united states had become a world power. its statistical program at that time, while considerable, was to prove insufficient. even by that date, however, 13 decennial censuses of population and 12 censuses of manufactures had been taken. an official wholesale price index had been started in 1902 and continues to the present. official series on employment and un employment were lacking, as were continuous data on hours and earnings, consumer prices, production and other current economic indicators. much preparatory work had been done, however, in special studies by individual scholars and by government in response to congressional urgings. from the 75th to the looth anniversary of asa i now want to bring to mind the period for which many of us have recollections. this is the period from the association’s 75th birthday to its 100th 1914 to 1939. it is on my personal recollections that i base much of what follows. this period covers the years between the outbreaks of two world wars, and includes the great depression. it was during this period that major advances were made in statistical methodology, in the application of statistics and statistical methodology in the social sciences, and particularly economics, in the development of the federal statistics program, and in the growth of the statistical association. let me begin with two statements by allyn a. young and wesley c mitchell reflecting lessons learned concerning official statistics during world war i. allyn a. young in his presidential address to this association in 1917 commented as fo1lows: “our national participation in the war has brought with it an enormous demand for prompt and exact statistical information the statistical activities of the federal government in times of peace cover in the main only those phases of national life which are deemed to be of public and especially of political moment. thus the federal government, in its statistical work has touched the current of our national life at only relatively few points, and at some of these only intermittently. for the most this current flows on in its own channels, free from disturbance or questioning or measurement by the government. except to the tax gatherer, a large part of the productive and business activities of the country have not been deemed to be matters of public concern, even as group aggregates.’’ “. if the statistical problems brought sharply into the foreground by the war hold any lesson that has a significance for times of peace, it is that we have not yet begun to realize the possibilities of federal statistics as a general scheme of national accountancy, or the responsibilities which the future holds for the statistician.” the next year wesley mitchell in his presidential address before the association took up allyn young’s message of the previous year. he stressed the need for active work by association members with government, the need for planning statistics which show the vital facts currently, and the need for a federal statistical coordinating agency. i quote his statement concerning the need for coordination.’l ‘ i but there was no coordinating agency, no bureau whose duty it was to consider the statistical needs of the government as a whole and to formulate systematic plans for supplying these needs. hence, there was duplication of work, no one knows exactly how much; many important fields were imperfectly covered, or not covered at all; the results of different bureaus could not be compared or combined readily because of differences in units used, in periods covered, and in classification; finally, the cost of federal statistics was needlessly high. ’’ these lessons with respect to official statistics, although well understood and appreciated, were not to result in actions with continuing impact until 1933. in this period also the effect of major advances in the development of statistical methodology began to be more widely felt and new developments took place. the work of pearson and his school in england was particularly influential. to students of statistics of the 20’s and o ’ s , the best remembered names are pearson, yule, elderton, and ezekiel then, near the close of the period, r. a. fisher. but the major impact of fisher seems to me also to be dominant in the period after 1939. in general, the methodological developments prior to r. a. fisher stressed curve fitting and correlation.12 these tools appealed strongly to economists and other social scientists and provided the basis for the derivation of empirical demand and supply curves, laws of pro duction, and business cycle analysis. multiple and partial correlation were enthusiastically accepted by the social scientists in this period. the keynesian revolution introduced macro economic analysis, the consumption function and model building. the change in the “face” of statistics which the methodological developments were bringing about is very well illustrated by the 1939 address of davis r. dewey who had been recording secretary from 1887 to 1906 and responsible for the editing of the new journal of the association in 1888. this address appears in the proceedings of the centenary celibration he noted in his introduction that his membership dated back 52 years. he said: ‘(. as i turn the pages of a statistical article or longer treatise, i find them be sprinkled with rabbit tracks; and often the only statistical series which i understand are the figures on the upper left hand and right hand corners.” it is during this 25 year period from 1914 to 1939 that the asa enjoyed almost a fourfold increase in membership, from 681 to 2,502. also in this same period other societies with somewhat related interests were formed: the econometric society in 1930; the population association of america in 1932; the institute of mathematical statistics and the psychometric society in 1935. but during this period when dewey’s “rabbit tracks” were appearing, the association was making one of its major contributions to the advancement of official statistics by attacking the deficiencies noted by young, mitchell and many others. “in june 1933, on the basis of an understanding with the secretaries of the federal departments concerned, the statistical association and the social science research council jointly organized a committee on government statistics and in formation services. ”14 this committee is better known as cogsis. as most of us in this room remember, 1933 was a special year in many ways. it was, among other things, the trough year of the great depression. at such times of crisis particularly if there is a background of already developed philosophy and ideas new proposals have the best chance of acceptance. on the recommendation of cogsis the president of the united states, by executive order dated july 27, 1933, created a central statistical board. this board was established “to formulate standards for and to effect coordination of the statistical services of the federal government incident to the purposes of the national industrial recovery act.# two years later, on july 25, 1935, an act establishing a central statistical committee composed of the secretaries of the treasury, agriculture, commerce, and labor; and a central statistical board for a period of five years was approved by the president. cogsis and the board during the period of their overlap worked almost as a single organization. it is not my intention here to review the detailed recommendations of cogsis, the work of the board or the achievements since. plans are now going forward to do this under the auspices of the washington statistical society with active participation of many of the prime movers in the original cogsis efforts. i do, however, want to do two things with respect to the work of cogsis and the central statistical board. first, to indicate the outstanding work of certain individuals in this effort. i do this with some risk because i cannot here mention everyone, and there is almost no one associated with the committee whose name does not rank high in the efforts to improve official statistics as tools for economic and social analysis and the appropriate methods for collecting and using such tools. i am appending to my paper a list of the members of cogsis so that all who read it may know the small group of men who accomplished so much to promote science and the national interest through statistics. two names i want to mention in particular. the first is stuart rice. his efforts and accomplishments for federal statistics over the years and to this present date have been of vital importance. he was a member of cogsis and its acting chairman in the summer of 1933. he was the head of the central statistical board and the agencies which succeeded it from 1935 to 1954. on the national scene and the international one, in both official and professional 1’ prefatory note to government statistics, a report of the committee on government statistics and information services, social science research council, bulletin 26, april 1937. circles, he was continuously working to promote statistical science. because of his unique character of perseverance in his own views and objectives, combined with his patience in trying to understand and take account of the views of other, he succeeded in achieving major objectives where many others would have failed. the second name is that of morris copeland. he possessed just the right degree of irascibility to provoke new ideas and the perspicacity to see and pursue their important consequences. both in economics and statistics he stimulated advances that otherwise would have been much slower. his work as executive secretary of the central statistical board was outstanding. to him we owe a considerable debt of gratitude. the second aspect of the work of cogsis on which i want to comment concerns the realism of the recommendations. the report was clearly the work of persons who knew government and the problems of collecting and disseminating information in the form of statistics. knowledge of the subject fields in which the data were to be used was also clearly evident. they saw the need for better planning and articulation of the overall program and utilized the notion of an independent central coordinating agency to achieve it. they were aware of the possible weaknesses of this method but also recognized the dangers inherent in overcentralization as well as difficulties of achieving meaningful objectives through centralization per se. in particular, cogsis recognized the need for improving the personnel associated with the statistical activities of government and the major problems involved in such improvement. it seems desirable to quote from the report on this point.’s “the wide variation among agencies in the character of personnel is an inevitable result of the amorphous expansion of governmental activities during the last generation. some statistical work has been nurtured in the environment of the natural sciences, and the high professional standards of science were carried over into statistical work as it was developed. personnel has been chosen on the basis of technical knowledge and qualities of leadership. “in other fields the growth of statistics has been exposed to less fortunate traditions. in some cases party politics have infected the organization in which a statistical agency has grown up. more often, the unfamiliarity of department heads with the technical nature of statistics has permitted statistical responsibility to be regarded as ‘anybody’s job,’ with the result that large sums of money have been wasted on undigested, and often undigestible data compiled by untrained laymen who often rise to assume positions of scientific importance as they grow old in the service.” it was also during the period between the beginnings of the two world wars that major advances in the development of a statistical system designed for analysis of specialized yet broadly based economic and social problems took place.16 it was during world war i that our official measures of prices, employment, and output were significantly extended. the problems of the major depression of the 1930’s and the pressures to meet them as rationally as possible stimulated the initiation and expansion of series on sales, inventories, production, hours, and earnings. this proliferation of series coupled with the demand for more comprehensive economic measures led to the development of systematic ways of summarizing and organizing masses of data. initial attempts, some made as early as world war i, included the valuable indices of industrial employment, wholesale prices, and industrial production. still more summary measures, first produced during the 1930's, reported on total employment in nonagricultural establishments, while in 1939 series on total labor force, employment and unemployment began, based on a monthly household survey newly designed for this special purpose. it was during the 1930's that, building on the work of king, mitchell, and kuznets, the first fully comprehensive measure of national output was developed in the united states namely, the estimates of national income. one other major landmark for the improvement of statistics should not be for gotten. the difficult and valuable, even if unromantic, development of a standard industrial classification. the sic was completed in 1939 and issued for the first time in printed form in 1941 42. the current quarter century of asa, 1930 1964 it is more difficult to describe the important elements of recent times be cause the trees often appear more prominent than the forest. but i shall try. first, let us note that statistics as a science and with a discipline of its own has come of age. the character of the journal today reflects these facts as does the organization of the association. while it is increasingly difficult for one immersed in the day to day task of official statistics to keep up with the more recent developments in statistical theory, it would appear to me that the advance has accelerated. the impacts of the advances in the past and current period, as i see them, have been in sampling theory, design of experiments, and statistical inference. except for sampling theory and its application to data collection, it would be my present position that many of the new advances have not yet been shown to be directly relevant to the analytical problems of the social sciences. except for the use of electronic data processing, time series analysis in the social sciences has still not been significantly affected by the new developments in statistical theory. on the other hand, the new methods have provided major new tools for obtaining confident answers to numerous special problems in the physical, engineering and biological sciences and to some extent in the field of business operations, such as quality control and inventory management. in macro economics they have not seemed to me to have provided major break throughs. it may be, however, that in the type of micro economic analysis suggested by orcutt and others,17 major advances can be made if an appropriate organization of data can be developed. whatever may be said about the advance of statistical methods for use in the social sciences, there is no doubt that the face of statistics continues to change radically and the importance of mathematics in the development of statistical method looms larger. this must be recognized by statisticians of all interests, whether they are young or old. our statistical association and other associations with allied interests must adjust to these changes. your association has been conscious of these changes and of the resultant changing interests of its membership. sections have been organized bio metrics, 1938; training, 1947; business and economic statistics, 1954; physical and engineering science, 1953, and social statistics, 1954. the programs of the annual meetings take these interests into account, and the constitutional re visions of 1954 and 1962 have helped to provide a general government of asa which would allow the several sections to be appropriately represented. recent presidential addresses have focused attention on these problems cochran in 1953; hoadley in 1958, likert in 1959, and hansen in 1960. in this period of the development of the more technical character of statistical discipline, the association has grown to a membership in 1963 of 8,248, more than tripling the figure for 1939; also during this period there has been added to the fraternity of statistical societies the society for quality control in 1946; the biometric society in 1947; the operations research society of america and the society for industrial and applied mathematics in 1952; the institute of management sciences in 1953; and the national institute of social and behavioral science in 1959. currently, in line with actions of a succession of officers of asa, efforts are going forward to establish closer liaison among statistical societies and to pro mote whatever organizational relationships further study may determine to be desirable. at the present time the institute of mathematical statistics, the biometric society and the asa have associated themselves together under a committee known as copss committee of presidents of statistical societies. this committee, and subcommittees organized by it, will work in areas of general interest to statistically oriented associations. if we carry on these efforts with clear recognition of the importance of the general principle set forth by bill cochran in his presidential address in 1953, namely that “ we are a scientific as distinct from a professional society, in the sense that the association has always worked for the highest statistical standards rather than for the economic interests of its members ’’ our efforts should be successful. and what of official statistics during this period? major advances have been made in every field. i shall not attempt to enumerate them here, as details have been set forth elsewhere’s and are already familiar to many of you. i need only remind you that this period witnessed the launching of the monthly re port on the labor force and current population survey, the national health survey, the annual survey of manufactures, quarterly series on expenditures for new plant and equipment, a monthly survey of retail sales, and many other important innovations, including efforts to throw new light on coming expenditures by a survey of consumer plans to buy major durables. significant advances have been made during this period in our system of national economic 18 most recently in ‘a federal statistics program for the 1960’s,” a study prepared for the subcommittee on economic statistics of the joint economic committee, congress of the united states, by the office of statistical standards, bureau of the budget and accounts, including the establishment of a systematic accounting framework for the national income accounts in 1947, the provision of basic data on capital stock and capital formation in manufacturing, the initiation of quarterly measures of the flow of real product, establishment of a set of flow of funds accounts, development of annual estimates of real product by industry and an input output table integrated with the income and product accounts, as well as renewed attention to the general body of social statistics to mention only a few of the developments. technical advances in official statistics during the period have been equally numerous and dramatic, including extended applications of probability sampling, quality control, evaluation of results, enumerator train ing, attention to enumerator and response bias and errors, and the introduction of electronic data processing equipment. the broader compass and the more technical character of modern statistics have not diminished the interest in statistics for use in the social sciences. in fact these very technical successes have and should continue to strengthen federal statistical efforts. as has been noted this has been particularly true of the application of sampling theory to data collection problems and the development of electronic data processing. there are a few very specific events in the period 1939 to date which we should not overlook. they are the foundations for much of the recent success in promoting an integrated body of federal statistics designed more specifically for economic and social analysis within and outside government. let me remind you of them: (1) the central coordinating agency established in 1933 as the central statistical board was transferred to the bureau of the budget, with in creased responsibility, in 1939 and became the office of statistical standards, commonly called oss. the point made by wesley mitchell and many others concerning the need for a coordinating agency has now been taken care of on a continuing basis. (2) subsequently oss was charged with the responsibilities of the bureau of the budget under the following laws and executive orders: a. federal reports act of 1942 which, with a few exceptions, requires inquiries addressed to 10 or more respondents to be approved by the bureau. one purpose of this act is to reduce burden on respondents, but it also serves to eliminate duplication in federal statistics and provides the occasion for introducing standard concepts and technical improvements as well as coordinating basic series. b. executive order 10033 (february 8, 1949) to coordinate the handling of statistical inquiries to the united states from inter national organizations. c. budget and accounting procedures act of 1950, section 103, and executive order 10253 (june 11, 1951) to develop programs and issue regulations and orders for the improved gathering, compiling, analyzing, publishing, and disseminating of statistical information by federal agencies. (3) the employment act of 1946 which established the council of eco nomic advisers and the joint economic committee. this did much, particularly through the work of the subcommittee on economic statistics, to focus attention on the development of economic and social statistics designed for the analysis of problems and of policy issues and thus requiring an integrated federal statistical program. (4) the establishment of close working relations with other groups of users of economic and social statistics and with groups representing respond ents. a business advisory council, now known as the advisory council on federal reports, was appointed in 1942. although primarily con cerned with the burden of reporting on business, the council has aided the statistical system by its statesmanship in dealing with reporting problems. in 1945, a labor advisory committee was appointed to advise on the statistical interests of this group of users. such specialized groups were later followed by the federal statistics users’ conference, established in 1956 to represent the views of business, labor, agriculture and professional groups on improvements needed in the federal statistical system. (5 ) report made by the nber for the hoover commission in 1948 dealing with the statistical services of the federal government, generally known as the mills long report. this report supported the general direction taken following cogsis and provided additional guidance. following this report continuous review of major statistical issues has been provided by an advisory committee to the bureau of the budget on statistical policy, composed largely of past presidents of the asa. (6) development of facilities for and acceptance of periodic review of important statistical areas by experts outside of government e.g., the reports organized by the board of governors of the federal reserve system at the request of the joint economic committee, the reports by committees set up by the nber at the request of the bureau of the budget to review the u. s. national accounts and price statistics, the committee to review unemployment statistics appointed by the presi dent at the request of the secretary of labor, and the current committee now reviewing balance of payments statistics which was appointed by the director of the bureau of the budget. to this should be added special reviews by oss as occasions arise and resources permit. as a result of these actions and many others it is my opinion that at the present time the federal government is beginning to have an integrated “statistical service” in the best sense of that term. the various statistical agencies with few exceptions work together to achieve recognized general objectives now being programmed in advance. while pride of and loyalty to agencies still is strong, as it should be, there is a clear recognition of a broader pride and loyalty directed toward integrity in the production of a general body of federal statistics well integrated and de signed to meet high standards of validity in serving the analytical needs of government, business, scholarly research, and the public generally. the history of the association is replete with instances in which the association was called upon to provide technical advice to government agencies, ever since the earliest days when advice was given on the content and quality of early census efforts and when the treasury secretary, in 1845, requested advice in preparing his report to the congress.’g sometimes in the early days, this ad vice took the form of recommendations and memorials to the congress. more often the advice was transmitted through individual members prominent in government service. the tradition of advice to the government continues today. numerous advisory committees to government statistical agencies depend heavily on asa in their composition. three standing committees of the association have his tories of “front line” participation in federal statistical developments. the advisory committee to the bureau of the budget on statistical policy has functioned since 1951. the census advisory committee, which works with officials of the bureau of the census on matters of overall program, has a continuous history since 1919. the census tract committee has been in existence since 1930 and has played a major role in the development of census tracts and the encouragement of local area data. in addition, the last 25 years have seen a number of ad hoc committees of statisticians established for special purposes. the bureau of labor statistics requested advice on its price index problems, the bureau of mines on the organization of its statistical work. a congressional committee requested an evaluation of the statistical methods used by the principal tv “rating” services. all these requests were met by the association through special committees established for the purpose. while staffing problems still present difficulties because of the demand for statisticians, the government is no longer in the position depicted by general walker. even now many persons enter government statistical work through related disciplines, but nearly all either come with or acquire appropriate train ing. pertinent data on this point were provided by a recent survey of its own staff by the census bureau, which i am sure could be repeated in other agencies with similar results. the survey showed 576 employees in professional positions, grades gs 5 to gs 17, classified as statisticians or in fields calling for work of an analytical statistical nature excluding such professional employees as engineers, programmers, geographers, and field office personnel. of these 576, only 22 were without an academic degree. among the others, 36 had ph.d.s, 102 had masters degrees, 212 had bachelors degrees and additional graduate work, and 204 had bachelors degrees. nearly all had had some training in mathematics and statistics and more than half had intensive training. the future let me conclude this review with a few words that relate to the future. one of the major purposes of putting my remarks in a historical frame of reference was to bring out the vitality of statistics as a science in all its phases and of the asa as one of the organs for its development. a second purpose was to show that, although other fields must also be given attention, the social sciences have had and will continue to have an important place in the development of statistics in all of its aspects. in this context i will cite just one, but i believe a most important, example of the impact which the social scientist will have on our official statistics. it stems from the increasing interest in analysis of the factors which motivate economic and social behavior of individuals, institutions and business firms and hence provide important insight for policy purposes. while this example concerns economics, i believe there are parallels in the broad field of social statistics. historically, most of our economic data have been gathered to develop aggregates, classified by industry, on items such as production, employment and payrolls, materials consumed, profits and investment in capital equipment. but if interest centers in the analysis of personal consumption or saving behavior, or the response of firms in adjusting production levels, inventory levels, or fixed capital investment, it is not sufficient to relate one aggregate series to another. the decision making units do not all behave in the same way. it is necessary to pay attention to individual firms within an industry rather than the industry as a whole. knowledge of the net effect of offsetting decisions is not sufficient. as interests move, as i believe they will, more in directions which require data for these microanalytic uses, how shall we adjust the content and mechanics of our official statistics programs to keep the important parts of our present system and incorporate micro information consistent with it? the ramifications of moves to meet these needs are extensive indeed. they affect not only the subject matter and timing of our statistics, but the way the data are collected. a different order of accuracy than that to which we are accustomed will be required in microanalysis; no longer can we, if we ever could, fall back on compensating errors washing out in aggregates. the nature of the problems with which the social scientist deals, and the problems which the statistician must solve in providing the data needed to meet these requirements of the social scientist, should be understood by both. i suggest that in the programs of the business and economics statistics and the social statistics sections, more attention should be given to cooperative exploration and discussion of mutual problems, to bringing the advance in statistical methods to bear on the problems of the social sciences and at the same time to provide guidance as to where further advance is needed. in particular the work in econometrics must be more clearly related to official statistics and advances in statistical methodology. it is appropriate at this point to note that some of the advances in statistical methods may not have the same relevance and significance to social science problems that they do for other more experimental sciences. the stress now being placed on sampling errors in official statistics is entirely appropriate. i am not so sure, however, that the people who use and interpret the data understand the sense in which sampling errors are useful as contrasted with other types of errors in the data. i believe, therefore, that we should give more attention to errors other than those of sampling. errors arising from biases induced by falsehood or ignorance, or by the enumeration process, are important and real and warrant the research efforts of statisticians concerned with methodology to find ways to eliminate them. the kind of new emphasis on methodology which is suggested by these observations calls for clearer determination of what the problems are in the social sciences, the methods being used to solve them and the data needs which fit these methods. one possibility which has been proposed to your association is the establishment of a new section on statistical methodology. i favor the proposal because i believe it would provide a focus for the evaluation of methods in various fields, particularly the social sciences. such a section would have as its major interest statistical methods generally, without reference to specific areas of application. it could be so oriented, however, as to attract participation by specialists in applied fields, and thus generate increased emphasis on the appropriateness of the application of statistical methods in diff went sub stantive fields. as we all know a goal can best be defined in terms of a limits concept, i.e., unattainable but approachable without limit. let us then define our goal for statistical science, in the same way as i would define the goal of all science, namely that the improvement which we are able to make and to pass on to our sons and daughters will be found by them not to be good enough. so that they in turn may pass on improved but still improvable accomplishments through all succeeding generations.

Bowker","1940-1969","﻿the first part of this article discusses the effort made by each state to provide the opportunity of a college education for its residents. based on the percent of the college age population that study at an institution of higher learning within their state, utah, arizona, north dakota, kansas, and montana rank as the national leaders. the second section develops a number of criteria which are used to rank graduate schools in the united states. a separate ranking is presented for the science and the social science humanities fields. to this extent that government is involved in higher education above the high school, it has traditionally been the concern of the state. there are a few exceptions where local governmental units take primary responsibility. such is the municipal college system of the city of new york, of which i am chief officer. there is also increasing federal aid to higher education. there has been nothing approaching a definite national policy except in the most general terms, e.g. “every child is entitled to his birthright education up to a youth’s maximum ability.” an excellent statement of the present condition of state and national concern for higher education is contained in the recent book by conant, shaping educational policy [1], in which he pleads persuasively for strong professional state wide planning in higher education as opposed to purely political decision making. whether the decision making process is professional or political, the decision makers need to have some standards of achievement to see whether a state is fulfilling its objectives. this talk is intended as a step in that direction. i will give specific ratings of states as examples of the kind of criteria that can be developed. much of the relevant data toward making such an assessment, based on the year 1957 58, was assembled by seymour harris [2], [3]. i have adopted, with certain significant modifications, the criteria used by harris, and applied them to 1962 and 1963 figures. a great deal of in formation is available about states, but the relevant question is, “how much higher education is provided?” i shall concentrate on a single enrollment figure which i condider the best measure of a state’s accomplishments. i make the following assumptions. 1. enrollment in private institutions should be counted on a par with en rollment in public institutions. a rational state policy should account for the load carried by both public and private institutions. states are subsidizing private institutions by direct grants in pennsylvania, by construction grants in maryland, by massive scholarships to virtually every student in new york, etc.; a state deserves credit at least to the extent that its residents are educated within its borders. 2. full time undergraduate enrollment is a better measure of achievement than total enrollment. everybody has some idea what a full time undergraduate is, so the data are better. part time enrollment data are troublesome. it is hard to disentangle real students from perennial graduate students and those en gaged sporadically in adult education. in the east, many of the big part time programs are tuition supported rather than financed by tax levy or endowment funds. in using full time enrollment i differ from seymour harris, who used total enrollment. 3. in 1963, out of 2,765,462 full time undergraduates studying for a b.a. or the equivalent, 617,111 or 22.3% studied in states away from home; these i have excluded from my index. the state from which they come should not get brownie points unless it is helping finance their out of state study. many of them go to new england or other areas of high concentrations of private edu cation, which is a good thing, but is a matter of historical location of private institutions, not attributable to state policy. (more than half of the migrating students fall into this category.) this measure may appear to be hard on excel lent state institutions which attract students from outside the state; many of them also retain a large proportion of state residents, and the bias involved in my criterion is not severe. a more sophisticated analysis might correct for net migration. these data also exclude some two year students in terminal pro grams, but this exclusion will not appreciably affect the comparisons. 4. the achievement of a state should be measured in some per capita terms; i use the college age population, defined as 18 21. there are differences in the proportion of college age youth in the various states from about eight percent in mississippi to four percent in arizona. the college age population thus does not reflect the total population of the several states. 5. forty eight states are included in the study. hawaii and alaska and the district of columbia are excluded for various reasons. there are enormous differences between the states on all of the enrollment measures. if we look at enrollment as a percent of college age population, we come up with the following table. i call “remaining” enrollment the number who stay in their own states for their college education. the honor roll of states, possibly to your surprise it was to mine is the following: 1. utah 2. arizona 3. north dakota 4. kansas 5. montana all five with thirty percent or more remaining in the state. utah ranks high on every criterion and ranked near the top seven years ago in the harris study. arizona does extremely well primarily with four large public institutions. the top ten states are indicated on the next map. added to the five just mentioned are south dakota, minnesota, nebraska, oklahoma, and california. if we take a look at the next ten, we include the northwest: colorado, iowa, wisconsin, michigan, and some of the east: new york, massachusetts and florida, states where public education has begun to make a quantitative difference. i should say that new york and california would rank a good deal higher if i used total enrollment instead of full time. i would also like to point out that i have not fully taken into account those students who are enrolled in technical programs in community colleges. this is due to the fact that data of this nature are not totally comparable because various states report community college enrollment in different ways. my esti mates indicate that there would not be any significant changes in the rankings of the states if these figures were included, with the exception of california, which would move from the tenth position to the sixth, and new york which would move from the eighteenth position to the fourteenth. as community college enrollment increases, as it is sure to do in the years to come, it will become increasingly necessary to include the enrollment figures of what might be considered the most dynamic area in higher education. the ten lowest states are all east of the mississippi river and include six southern states, three new england states, and delaware. the percent of full time remaining students runs around eleven to fourteen percent of the age group. it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why these great differences exist; a number of factors were examined. the most natural question is the relationship of achievement to the wealth of a state; a plot of state rank in “remaining” enroll ment vs. rank per capita personal income is shown in figure 111. there is a slight tendency for very low per capita income states to have low achievement, but there is not much association. none of the best five states ranks above the median state per capita income. as i mentioned earlier, the young people in the united states are distributed among the states differently from the total population. on the whole, the south has a rather high percent of youth and has therefore a heavier burden, al though washington and oregon combine high achievement with relatively high numbers of young people. the top states tend to mount iarge efforts in public higher education. this does not imply that the fraction of the total enrollment carried by public institutions need be large; in utah only about two thirds are in public higher education. this is actually rather low. on the other hand, public higher educa tion in utah handles more students than all but a handful of states handle with both public and private institutions. among the top ten states, it would appear that twenty to thirty percent of the resident college age youth are in public institutions. my own opinion is that it will be difficult to establish adequate state enroll ment without such public underpinning. but, i must say, after looking at all the variables involved, that the main factor appears to be the commitment of the state: the political commitment and the commitment of the philanthropic group who finance private education. in a way, i’m sorry that i selected the topic of my speech before conant’s book came out because i would like to read you his last chapter, “toward a nationwise education policy.” he is pessimistic about the states’ financial ability to provide educational opportunity extensively, and pessimistic about the federal government’s political ability to subsidize higher education, be cause of the large number of colleges with denominational affiliations and the question of segregation. he proposes that all the states or groups of states act jointly to formulate educational policy in cooperation with the federal govern ment. my own view is not so pessimistic; a subsidy to each state to enable it to educate, say, up to ten percent of the college age population, with the require ment that an additional ten percent supported by state funds, would provide the basic underpinning for high achievement. this could be combined with a large scale undergraduate scholarship program which might specifically pro mote mobility by providing incentives like travel grants plus out of state tui tion or private college tuition. this could help to reverse what i consider the worst tendency in higher education, which i’m sure this talk will accelerate, the tendency to close state university doors to non residents. such a program too might also be structured to draw young people from both urban and rural slums by massive efforts at remedial work, counseling, recruitment and placement. i shall now turn to the measurement of quality of higher education; my first topic is the quality of graduate schools, a subject discussed in detail by berelson in his book, “graduate education in the united states” [4], pub lished in 1960. his basic classification is a modification of one developed by howard keniston of the university of pennsylvania in 1957, who asked de partmental chairmen in arts and sciences across the country to rate the top departments in their fields, and constructed composite rankings from their rat ings. these ratings identified about twenty schools as outstanding. berelson added m.i.t. and cal. tech. to this top list, and added another category of twenty five graduate schools which comprise the members of the association of graduate schools (the traditional association of the leading graduate insti tutions) and nine universities which received accomplishment grants from the ford foundation a few years ago. he validates this selection by studying the numbers of faculty who contributed to scholarly journals and by studying the absolute number of doctorates produced. the last named factor up to now has been remarkably associated with quality. i shall discuss the results of his ratings in a moment. i have taken a different track. the existence of large scale competi tive fellowship programs such as the national merit scholarship program, the national science foundation programs, and the woodrow wilson fellowship program enables us to identify the institutions where a large number of the ablest young people go to college or graduate school. other honors, such as election to the national academy of sciences or the awarding of a research fellowship by the council of learned societies, represent the judg ment of a faculty member by his peers. it is to data of this sort that i have turned. first, let me present the keniston berelson list, first, the top ten plus two; harvard, california (berkeley), columbia, yale, michigan, chicago, princeton, wisconsin, cornell, illinois, m.i.t., and california tech. the next ten are; penn sylvania, minnesota, stanford, u.c.l.a., indiana, johns hopkins, north western, ohio state, n.y.u., and washington (seattle). lastly, the final group called “others” include brown, catholic, clark, duke, emory, fordham, georgetown, iowa, iowa state, kansas, missouri, nebraska, north carolina, notre dame, pennsylvania state, purdue, rice, rochester, st. louis, syra cuse, texas, tulane, vanderbilt, virginia, and washington (st. louis). michigan state should really be added to this list: it has just been elected to the aau. my own method of developing rankings leads me to deal with science sepa rately from social science and humanities. one criterion was the number of former woodrow wilson fellows on the faculty as reported in 1961 62. the ranking nineteen schools are shown in table 2. actually, twenty nine were ranked: the ranking was stopped when ties introduced instability; in this series we had a three way tie for eighteenth place and a ten way tie for twenty fourth place with four fellows which we used as our cut off point in the actual study. the other criteria used were (1) the number of woodrow wilson fellows choosing a school, which gave meaningful rankings for thirty eight schools; (2) the number of council of learned societies award winners on the faculty, which gave meaningful rankings for thirty seven schools; and (3) the number of guggenheim memorial fellows on the faculty, which gave mean ingful rankings for thirty seven schools. all told, about fifty schools were caught by this net and ranked by average rank on the four criteria. the rankings are presented in table 3. a similar exercise was performed for science. one of the component rankings was the national science foundation regular fellows attending a school. only the leading twenty one schools are shown in table 4 although in this case it was possible to rank forty one institutions before massive ties set in. the other criteria used were the numbers of members of the national academy and of nobel laureates on the faculty. a composite ranking yielded forty eight insti tutions (see table 5 ) no attempt was made to disentangle medical school lau reates or academicians from those in arts and science departments. these ratings, like those based on informed opinion, probably lag somewhat when a school is on the move. before talking more about the results of the graduate ranking, i would like to examine two tables of similar data relevant to quality of undergraduate colleges. just as we have considered where recipients of honorific fellows go to graduate school, it is possible to study where they prepared. geographic biases in the selection process in all fellowships but they would work against the leaders.) the twenty leading baccalaureate sources of woodrow wilson fellows are listed on table 6. similar data on nsf fellows and others can be obtained. another relevant series is put out by the national research council on baccalaureate origins of doctor’s degrees. these data cover about twelve hundred institutions, but only the leading group is given (see table 7). what does this analysis show? first, the leading twenty or twenty two grad uate schools are about the same as they were identified by keniston and berelson. there has been some movement within the group: stanford ranks third on my science scale and sixth on my humanities and social science scale; it probably is now in the top ten rather than the second ten. as a matter of fact, i started tabulating these data on my previous reincarnation at stanford more or less to watch this phenomenon. one additional institution has gained the stature of the top twenty: the university of texas appears to be doing ex tremely well. all of the top twenty two schools listed in the berelson keniston rankings appear among the leaders in my ranking. however, as we look at his third comparing it to my below twenty group, certain modifications are indi cated. based on the science ranking, i would add the following schools: carnegie institute of technology, colorado university, university of arizona, rutgers, the state university of new jersey, western reserve university, florida state university, lehigh university, university of maryland, michigan state university, oklahoma state university, university of tennessee, yeshiva university. the social science humanities rankings indicate the following additions: rutgers, the state university of new jersey, state university of new york, university of oregon, boston university, michigan state university, brandeis university, tufts university, university of connecticut, dartmouth college, wayne state university, williams college, university of kentucky. note that rutgers and michigan state appear in both lists of additions i have just cited, but only nine of berelson’s third group of twenty five occur in both listings. (brown u., duke u., iowa, u. of., north carolina, u. of, notre dame, u. of, rochester u. of, texas u. of, virginia, u. of, washington u. (st. louis)). it therefore seems doubtful that a comprehensive ranking of graduate schools can profitably be extended beyond the first thirty or thirty five institutions. it appears that below that point we must search for excellence in particular areas. these quality ratings could be combined by states to give some indication of state quality, which along with absolute ph.d. production, would give a state an indication of the importance of its total graduate effort. but from the present data, state officers can see whether there are important graduate insti tutions within their state or region. interest in the undergraduate quality indices is relevant to another question of public policy. several government agencies, the national science foundation, and the office of education are interested in the creation of a few new centers of excellence. certainly one criterion is the verifiable existence of upward drive in the quality of graduate work. another, perhaps more important, is furnished by the intellectual quality and aspirations of undergraduate students because in spite of popular legend to the contrary, graduate schools feed on their own students to an astounding degree. these data are not intended as a consumer guide. the top graduate schools attract the best students, and probably turn out better products, but this may well reflect more on the quality of the raw material than on the process of the education. and in the event that one wants to send his child to a college which will maximize his chance of rubbing elbows with future professors how ever incredible such an aim might be the series on undergraduate quality should be divided by the size of the school or the graduating class and put on some per capita basis. this was done a few years ago by knapp and green baum [ 5 ] my principal concern has been to focus on data relevant to public policy the adequacy of higher education in the various states and the quality of our advanced graduate effort. the latter is now primarily a concern of the federal government; the former still lies on the shoulders of the states. for those who believe in state initiative and responsibility, it is not too late to assume leader ship. whether it will actually be done is anybody’s guess. but surely the people will not toierate for too many more years such great inequities in the quality and quantity of higher education offered to its youth.

Allen Wallis","1940-1969","we were organized in boston on november 27, 1839. last fall, there was a birthday celebration in boston at which we were honored by the attendance of six past presidents of the association, not to mention the then current president and at least four future presidents: albert €1. bowker, martin r. gainsbrugh, morris h. kansen, frederick mosteller, stuart a. rice, frederick f. stephan, helen m. walker, aryness j. wickens, edwin b. wilson. we were also honored by the participation of the mayor of boston, the honorable john f. collins and, whatever you may have heard about certain earlier mayors of boston, it was an honor to have this one with us. in view of the successful celebration of our 125th birthday last fall, for which me are indebted to the boston chapter, it is not necessary that we do more now than note that this is our 125th annual meeting. as a former statistician or, as i say in other company, a reformed statistician i cannot help but speculate on what it is that is so noteworthy about a 125th anniversary. why is it so much more noteworthy than, say, a i23rd or a 126th anniversary? true, it is a quarter of the way into our second century. but after all, that is not a characteristic of time but of the fact that we use a decimal system of numbers. if we used a duodecimal system, our age would not yet have reached three digits. we would still have nineteen years to go to complete our first duodecimal “century.” occasions like this, a quarter of the way be tween changes in the third digit, would occur every thirty six years instead of every twenty five. on the other hand, if we used a binary system, every year would be a quarter of the way toward a change in the third digit; and far from being a remarkable characteristic of an annual meeting, it would be an annual characteristic. but, forgetting all that and considering only the decimal system, why is a quarter of a century so much more noteworthy than a fifth or a third? it is not my intention to belittle the idea of singling out the 125th anniversary as something special. on the contrary, i too feel that there is something special about it. one thing special about it for me is that nothing like it has happened before during my participation in the association’s affairs, arid i am not likely to be still participating when something like it happens again. true, i was already in the field of statistics at the time of the 100th annual meeting, but i was not a participant in the association’s affairs beyond having published one article in the journal. in fact, i did not become a member until five months after the 100th annual meeting. similarly, i am not likely to be active in asa the next time a quarter century anniversary occurs. actuarial tables show that i have an appreciable chance of being still alive at our 150th anniversary, but the chance of my being active in asa is negligible although a member who was active until he died last year had been president in 1912, the year i was born, at which time he was within a year or two of my present age.’ twenty five years, then, appears to approximate the typical span of peak activity in a professional career. it seems to be, in short, a generation in the professional as well as the biological sense. it appears that even statisticians, at least when we deal with our own affairs, are governed by very human and personal values in this instance, the scale of human life and the span of professional careers rather than by abstract, “objective” properties of numbers. hence a 125th anniversary really is remarkable. the statistical association is, i am told, the second oldest national learned society, the philosophical society being the oldest. this news usually shocks our colleagues in economics, whose economic association was founded forty six years later; in science, whose american association for the advancement of science came along nine years later; in modern languages, forty four years later; in physics, sixty years later; in chemistry, thirty seven years later; and so forth. statistics is somehow still regarded by some as a new and youthful subject; or to put it another way, as a perpetually immature and adolescent subject, one which is by now perhaps beyond hope of ever maturing. this attitude may be explained by a number of circumstances. one is that statistics is a small field compared with the others i mentioned a small field, in fact, compared with almost any other. only in the past twenty five years has it acquired the full range of paraphernalia associated with established disciplines: a variety of professional societies, a proliferation of technical journals, and most important departmental status in nearly all of the most respected universities. but the lack of widespread esteem for statistics is explained also by an inherent characteristic of our subject. pure statistics is a realm of ideas, like philosophy. as with philosophy, its central achievements are likely to be comprehensible only to the sophisticated. those whose intellectual goals are basically “more bang per buck” find the new subject of statistics and the ancient subject of philosophy alike disappointing in both bangs and bucks. neither statisticians nor philosophers build bombs, automate production, care cancer, meet payrolls, or carry precincts. statistics in its applied forms does, of course, associate intiniatcly, and in ways that arc exciting and gratifying to statisticians, with bangs and bucks. statistics makes important contributions to our defense, to our economy, to our health, to our social organization, to our science and scholarship, and to our government. but in these applications, statistics is always secondary. the great advances in physics that showed the way to nuclear energy, the brilliant engineering that achieved controlled nuclear reactions, even the remarkable ingenuity that produced nuclear weapons twenty years ago this summer, all represented accomplishments in which the contributions of statistical techniques, where they are discernible at all, are undramatic in comparison with the truly heroic intellectual triumphs of individual geniuses or of creative organizations. the same is true of the role of statistics in other great ventures: with the sciences of biology and chemistry arid their application iii medicine, with the sciences of physics and engineering and their application in communication, and with the sciences of economics and politics and their application in economic policy. the complaint that statistics is never the star of the show is not unlike the complaint that a lineman on a football team rarely scores any points. one who is not temperamentally suited to being a lineman ought not to take up statistics. even if research in which he plays a vital role should win a nobel prize, it is almost certain that the statistician will not personally be a laureate. nor do i mean to imply that he should be. my point is that his contribution may be indispensable, but it will not be spectacular; his contribution may be great, but it will be as a key member of the orchestra, possibly even with some solo pass ages, seldom as the conductor and never as the composer. in short, when the statistician does something outstanding of a practical nature that captures attention and admiration, his specific contribution is not dramatic and probably not individually distinguishable. when he does some thing dramatic and individually distinguishable, it is usually in the realm of abstract ideas, and hence does not capture attention. so the fact that our field does not receive all the public acclaim that it merits should not diminish our own satisfaction in being part of it or our own pride in its accomplishments in ideas and applications. the field of statistical application with which i have been most closely associated is economics. when i first studied economics, nearly thirty five years ago, we were excited by the great things that were clearly within im mediate reach to be grasped by the tools of statistics and mathematics. it is true that some of the books we read, like those of irving fisher, pareto, walras, edgeworth, and cournot, were not exactly hot o f f the press; cournot’s, in fact, was approaching its centennial and the others mentioned were virtually all from the nineteenth century, though we also read bowley and evans and one or two others from the early twentieth century. nevertheless, we had a feeling of excitement, of novelty, of innovation, and of imminent triumph. this is a feeling that i recognize in each new generation of economics graduate students as it comes on the scene. they are as convinced as we were that mathematics and statistics arc the wave of the future for economics, the keys that will easily, speedily, and surely unlock all mysteries. they arc, if anything, even more excited about the novelty of the mathematical approach. some of this excitement and enthusiasm is even spilling over into psychology, sociology, and political science. whether mathematics will make more substantial contributions to our understanding of the economy in the next thirty five years than in the past thirty five years is an opcri question. its contributions, though not negligible, have by no means measured up to the enthusiastic expectations of thirty five years ago. for statistics, however, the story is different. its contributions to economics may not have been exactly the ones we expected, but they have exceeded rather than disappointed our expectations. statistics and economics are intertwined in at least three distinct ways: first, economic theory and statistical theory have borrowed profitably from one another. statistical decision theory, for example, made an important gain when abraham wald’s basis of the loss function was changed by jimmie savage from absolute cost to what economic theorists had long known as “alternative cost” or “opportunity cost.” economic theory, in turn, made a significant advance based on decision theory when von neumann and morgenstern restored the concept of utility to the foundations of economics, from which it had been drummed out in disgrace a dozen years earlier. the second way in which economics and statistics are intertwined is that our factual knowledge of the economy rests largely on statistical investigations. the most notable of these were initiated by wesley mitchell at the beginning of the century, carried on since the first world war at the national bureau of economic research, and in many cases eventually picked up by government bureaus. it is as a result of mitchell’s work and that of his associates and followers at the national bureau that economists know the facts about business cycles; about national income and its distribution; about gross national product ; about consumer prices; about productivity ; and about several other important aspects of the economy. (mitchell, by the way, was president of this association in 1918.) third, economic policy is to a certain extent guided by and evaluated by statistical measurements. (more precisely, policy is guided by statistics to an uncertain extent.) our nionetary authorities, for example, are responsible for the index of industrial production, which they initiated and have repeatedly improved because of its importance in fulfilling their responsibilities for the stability of the economy. i propose to devote the rest of my time this evening to some remarks about economic statistics and economic policy. five or six years ago i had occasion, as the chairman of tonight’s session has told you, to look into this rather closely, particularly in regard to prices, employment, and economic growth. in my observation, differences on economic policy do not arise, for the most part, from differences in the results desired from economic policy. nor do they arise, except indirectly, from differences about economic theory, for example between keynesian and quantity theorists. they arise in large measure from different pictures of what the world is like; that is to say, from different notions of what the facts are. even the differences in theory are in large part rooted in the same source; thus, those who attribute more importance to fiscal than to monetary policy usually are not familiar with the empirical study made for the committee for economic development’s commission on monetary policy by friedman and eiselman, or in a few cases presumably are familiar with it but do not accept it as competent work. i suggest that our national economic policies in the 1030’s were misguided by statistics which were properly enough interpreted had they been accurate, but mere not sufficiently accurate; and that our policies in the 1960’s are being misguided by statistics that are accurate enough but are being misinterpreted. i refer particularly to price statistics in the so’s and to unemployment statistics in the 60’s. to avoid misunderstanding, perhaps i should say not “mis guided” but “less than optimal,” for the record of our economy during the past twenty years hardly leaves room for the term “misguided” except in that sense. it is often suggested that prices have always risen. frequently a speaker or writer remarks that prices have doubled in the past twenty five years, and then slips in a reference to “this continuous rise in prices.” others profess that the behavior of prices since the second world war has been unprecedented, and proceed to attribute this to special causes, usually monopoly in labor or in business. indexes of united states prices have been constructed back to 1720 for wholesale prices and back to 1800 for retail prices. only the broadest kind of interpretation can be based on the early data because of their limitations; and it has to be kept in mind that at the revolutionary war there was a complete rupture in the series, of which the phrase “not worth a continental” is a reminder. in the broadest sweep, however, the series show near constancy in the basic trend of average prices over the whole 245 years. there is, in fact, an upward movement averaging, speaking very roughly, one half of one percent per year. h second striking characteristic of the 245 year sweep is that high, sharp peaks occur intermittently. each peak, of course, is associated with a war. conversely, each of our wars except the mexican and the spanish is marked by a peak. if we sort the 215 years into two groups, according to whether the country was at war or at peace, we find that] during years of war prices have risen something like an average of ten percent per year, and that during years of peam the rate has been minus one half of one percent per year. this slight decline in years of peace represents gradual recoveries from the wartime peaks. in fact, after each war except the second world war prices eventually regained, or practically regained, at least momentarily, their pre war level. a third striking feature of the 245 year series is that there are long tidal movements: periods of two and three decades in which the prevailing movement was upward or downward. the period from 1865 to 1895, for instance, was one of creeping deflation, in which retail prices fell by nearly half and wholesale prices by nearly two thirds. a fourth feature of our price history is recurrent short waves. these are associated with business cycles. typically price levels are steady as recovery commences, and remain so until the late stages of expansion. they then begin to rise. they continue rising as the peak is reached and recession sets in, but stabilize in the latter part of the recession. only in severe recessions do price levels actually fall to an appreciable extent. thus the long run rise of half a percent per year represents a cumulation of rises in normal business cycles, offset every so often by a fall during a severe recession. here we see a possibility of a real change in the behavior of price levels: if severe depressions have been eliminated, as is believed now even more widely than it was believed in the 192o’s, we may have something like a gradual, ratchet like upward movement in the price index. if that were the case i shall indicate later that i doubt that it is it might be more important than previously for our economic policy makers to be vigilant to prevent even small rises in price levels. we might have a situation like that in medicine, where progress has given enlarged importance to problems which formerly seemed minor compared with many overwhelming problems that now have almost disappeared. price levels have behaved much the same in the business cycles since the second world war as in comparable cycles before. nevertheless, each recession sees numerous economic commentators assuming that prices naturally fall when business falls, and writing that the continued rise represents some thing unnatural, unprecedented, and disastrous. special explanations are then off wed. apart from the fact that there has been no special behavior to require, or even permit, special explanations, the explanations that are offered most frequently union wage policies or business price policies, depending on whose ox the commentator wishes to gore would not account for inflation anyway. monopolistic practices might account for prices being higher than they other wise would be (though even this is dubious when applied to an average of prices for the whole economy) but inflation is a matter not of high prices but of rising prices. if monopolies are causing rising prices, the extent of monopoly must be rising. although many people believe this to be true for both labor and business, statistical studies suggest that it is not true for either. although the consumer price index has more than doubled since 1940, over seventy percent of that rise had occurred by 1952. beginning with 1952, the consumer price index has risen an average of about one and one quarter percent per year. nineteen fifty two was the year after the ‘(accord” between the treasury and the federal reserve, terminating the pegging of interest rates; it was also the year after the end of heavy fighting in korea; and it was the year before the change of party in washington, in a period of prosperity such as has prevailed since 1941, the index has a definite upward bias, arising not only from improvements in the quality of goods, which some economists have recently recognized as causing a problem of measurement, but also from quite a number of other source^.^ the magnitude of the upward bias cannot be appraised accurately, but it may well account for all, or even a little more than all, of the upward movement of the index since 1952. if this is true, as i personally am inclined to guess that it is, we need not take seriously the danger i mentioned earlier of a cumulative, ratchet like price rise resulting from the apparent disappearance of major depressions. nevertheless, throughout the 50’s the administrations aiid niore important the federal reserve were fighting inflation. the rise in the index due to statistical biases intensified a sensitivity to inflation that resulted partly from the great inflation of the second world war and the lesser inflation of the korean war,4 but partly from the fact that some of the worst consequences of those inflations did not occur until after they were over for example, when people retired to find that, in real yalue, about half of what they had set aside before the war for retirement had been confiscated for the war. because of this sensitivity to the dangers of inflation, the rise in the index, slight as it was, probably caused the monetary authorities to be too restrictive and too quick to curtail or limit expansion in the economy. there arc other instances in which economic policy has been misguided by statistics that were inadequate for the reliance put on them. i will turn briefly, however, to an example, unemployment statistics, in which the fault is not so much in the statistics as in the interpretations of them. discussions of employment are still heavily conditioned by the traumatic experience of the 1930’s. for the ten years 1931 through 1940, the median rate of unemployment was eighteen percent of the civilian labor force, and twenty five percent of the non farm civilian labor force. this median of eighteen percent was approximately the rate that prevailed in 1938 (nineteen percent) and 1939 (seventeen percent). the lowest rate for ally year in the decade was fourteen percent, in 1937. during the other fifty five years of this century there has been no year in which the rate was as high as the lowest rate in the decade 1931 to 1940. outside that decade, the highest rate was twelve percent in 1921, the second highest was ten percent in 1915, and the third highest was nine percent in 1930. in contrast to the median of eighteen percent for the decade 1931 1940, the median for the preceding thirty years was 4.4 percent, and the median for. the price index makes it appear that a great deal of inflation occurred just after the second world war. this was in fact largely a matter of the index getting back in touch with reality after having had its head held in the sand during the war. the decade 1951 to 1960 was 4.2 percent. here again we see a basic similarity, at least in broad outline, between our experience since the war and our previous experience. various economists have at one time or another purported to see an upward trend in unemployment figures in the past fifteen years. in general, those who see such a trend are those who favor public policies that they think would have a greater chance of adoption if there were such a trend; and those who fail to see such a trend are those who favor policies more likely to prevail if there were no such trend. one evidence of a trend is that at the business peak of i953 unemployment had gotten down to three percent, at the 1957 peak to four percent, and at the 1960 peak to five percent. it must be noted, however, that if three un equal numbers are arranged at random, there is one chance in three that, they will ascend or descend monotonically. also, the 1953 peak was associated with war, which almost always brings abnormally full or over employment ; but if we ignore 1953, as we should for this purpose, we have only one observation on the direction of change. if we look back to the 1948 peak, we find four percent unemployment, which destroys the monotonicity; and if we look ahead to the next peak we see that the figure is already down nearly to four percent, also destroying the monotonicity. although a superficial analysis such as that just sketched can not be taken seriously, which ever conclusion is drawn from it, an analysis of the unemployment figures shows that an upward trend is built into them, at least for the time being, by the fact that they are not standardized. the general unemployment rate may be regarded as an average of the rates prevailing for various parts of the labor force. unemployment rates vary considerably from one part of the labor force to another: they vary, for ex ample, with age, sex, race, education, occupation, arid marital status. the relative size of the various parts of the labor force is shifting; the proportion of the labor force that is female, for example, has doubled, approximately, in this century, new entrants in the labor force are, by definition, un employed from the moment they enter until they get their first jobs, and the proportion of new entrants is rising about five years ago i had a rough calculation made of the rise that could be expected in figures on unemployment during the next five years if the actual rates of unemployment stayed exactly the same for all parts of the labor force. this calculation showed, in other words, the effect to be expected from demographic changes alone. it turned out that the overall unemployment figure would rise nearly ten percent in five years if unemployment rates were un changed that is, by about one half of a percentage point this calculation was made in 1960 by walter d. farmer, now at tllr university of chicago graduate school of business. he used forecabis published in 1959 by the bureau of labor statistics of the composition of the labor force in 1965. in testimony before the joint economic committee on january 29, 1964, fackler piesented a revised calculation, based on the bls's 1963 forecasts of the 1965 labor force the revised calculation showed essentially the same ten percent rise mentioned here. on the other hand, albert recs, of the university of chicago department of economics, tells me that he, bancroft of the bureau of labor statistics, and the president's council of economic advisers have all made calculations in which current rates were weighted according to the composition of the labor force in 1955 or 1957. in all three of these calculations a standardized average one in which the rates for the various parts of the labor force are always represented in the overall average with weights representing a labor force of standard composition, regardless of changes in their actual representation in the labor force would avoid the changes due not to employment changes but to demographic changes. this is not to say, however, that the unemployment figure, if there is to be a single number that is the uunemployment figure, should be a standardized average. whether a standardized average should be used depends on the decisions which the figure is to guide. for some purposes, changes in the aggregate number unemployed are important regardless of whether the cause is changes in unemployment rates or changes in the composition of the labor force. this is true in judging the welfare requirements or the political consequences of unemployment. for other purposes, changes in the unemployment rates per se are important and should be abstracted from demographic changes. this is true in judging policies affecting the overall level of economic activity. an index of unemployment that is, a standardized average expressed as a percentage of some base figure would have another advantage, namely to focus attention on changes in the level of unemployment instead of on the absolute level. the absolute level is an ambiguous concept, not really subject to meaningful measurement. the definition of an unemployed person used by the bureau of the census is a person who did not work at all during the calendar week and either was looking for work or would have been looking had he not been sick, or already expecting recall from a layoff, or convinced that no work was available in his line. this definition is certainly vulnerable to criticisms made of it from time to time, and so is the treatment of part time workers and holders of two jobs. it seems to me unlikely, however, that other definitions can be evolved that are subject to substantially less criticism, even though the criticisms might be different.6 most of the objections are eliminated, or at least greatly vitiated, when attention is focussed on changes in unemployment instead of on the absolute level. an index would also eliminate international comparisons, which generally are fallacious. unemployment statistics, like price statistics or any other statistics, are subject to error; and unemployment statistics, like price statistics, are subjected to burdens that their precision does not justify. our unemployment statistics do include valid measures of sampling error, which our price statistics do not, but the problem of seasonal variation and the margin of sampling error are such that differences of a tenth of a percentage point do not support the conclusions sometimes based on them by publicists, politicians, and a few economists. similarly, the figures for geographic areas or other subdivisions of the total labor force are not accurate enough for some of the important eco composition of the labor force \yas only about half as great as in fackler’s calculation, and in one case the direction was reversed. this does not affect the point made in the text, but it does warn against uncritical acceptance of the specific figures used for illustration. during the annual meeting at which this presidential address was delivered, robert stein of the bureau of labor statistics reported on current experimental work with improved definitions. his report perhaps justifies more optimism than i have expressed here about the consequences of improved definitions. economic policies based on them, for example, aid to depressed areas, or extending the duration of unemployment benefits. for guiding the overall rate of economic activity, unemployment statistics need to be complemented by statistics on job vacancies. this is difficult to measure, or even to define rigorously; but substantial and significant efforts are at last under way, and judging by reports at one of the sessions of this annual meeting seem to afford some prospect of success. the moral i extract from the two foregoing examples, and others with which i will not burden you, is that while in principal economic statistics can be of enormous value in economic policy, in practice they often lead to errors in economic policy. one kind of error arises when figures are not sufficiently ac curate, and mislead policy makers who interpret them at facc value. a second type of error arises when figures are accurate enough, but are interpreted erroneously. to reduce the incidence of the first kind of error, it is incumbent upon statisticians to develop better techniques, to teach better techniques to those who are or will become practitioners, and to inculcate and themselves adhere to the highest standards of objectivity and technical competence. to reduce the incidence of the second type of error it is incumbent upon us to ex tend and improve the statistical education of all economists not just those who will be compiling and analyzing statistics, but all who will have a role in interpreting statistics and influencing action based on them. great strides have been made and are being made in both these tasks, yet it is not clear that we are keeping up with the needs.

and a quarter since our association was founded has been crowded with great historical events and profound transformations. in many of these developments, members of our association, past and present, were prominent leaders, advisors, and active participants. they played important roles in the rise of modern business, government and education; the progress of the sciences; the achievement of rationality in administration and in the professions; the improvement of working and living conditions; and the enhanced productivity of human effort in both manual and intellectual enterprises. these developments of the past century and a quarter were closely related to developments elsewhere throughout the world. we benefited from the ventures of our counterparts, especially in europe and particularly in great britain. we borrowed freely and, when we could, we gave in return. today members of our association are working with statisticians in many countries, and we are sharing in the advances made in india, japan, australia, and other asian countries. during these momentous years, the theory and practice of statistics have been shaped by the kinds of problems our members have encountered in their diverse activities. fundamentally their problems sprang from the need to know and to act effectively in whatever sphere of life each member had chosen for his work. specifically, they required quantitative information, ever more detailed, more comprehensive, more accurate, and more effectively interrelated. concurrently, they required continuity, comparability, and ever more sophisticated analysis. inevitably, they stimulated the mathematical and logical developments that are proceeding so rapidly in our research and publications. thus, our association has, from its beginning, both served and been shaped by the rapid developments of the past as they have generated demands for statistical information on a wide variety of subjects and urgent needs for ever more accurate and effective means of drawing inferences from such statistical information. today the growth and evolution of statistics are proceeding more rapidly than ever. we cannot foresee exactly what course they will follow, but we can anticipate some of their likely trends. by concerted effort among ourselves and with other professional and scientific societies, we can influence their pace and direction in mutually beneficial pursuit of the general welfare. if we are alert and perceptive in recognizing the opportunities, if we are wise and prompt in deciding what to do, if we are skillful and persistent in accomplishing it, then we can make the next quarter century the most significant yet in the history of our association and our profession. there is a fascinating history to be written some day, tracing the statistical developments that stemmed from the problems of farmers and industrial workers in the rapid industrialization of the united states, the difficulties of industrial mobilization during world war i, the growth of trade associations during the expansion of the 20s) the economic earthquake known as the great depression, the multivarious scientific and industrial innovations of world war i1 as well as the associated problems of scheduling, control and progress reporting, the vast expansion of medical and biological research supported by lavish appropriations in the past two decades, the atomic energy and space programs, the great enlargement of federal government financing of education, the housing and urban renewal programs, and the poverty program, among others. we can be sure that future developments of comparable importance will establish new demands for statistical information, require novel uses of standard methods of analysis and inference, and stimulate additional discoveries and inventions in both theory and practice. let us look at some of the evidence we can see around us today. clearly, there is a great demand for more and better statistical information than is now avail able and for better availability of what does exist. although some $107,000,000 was devoted to current statistical programs during the fiscal year just ended, and $15,000,000 more for periodic programs, the unmet needs appear to be substantial. in fact, the august issue of business in brief, issued by the economic research division of the chase manhattan bank, states, “an increase in these expenditures of as little as $10 million a year would pay off bountifully in heightened knowledge.” just a month ago, senator william proxmire, chairman of the subcommittee on economic statistics of the joint economic committee, transmitted a re port on government price statistics with the following comment : “witnesses generally expressed disappointment that so little progress has been made in implementing past recommendations. there is widespread recognition that our price information is not adequate for the burden of public and private policy formulation that it must carry. better price statistics are urgently called for, since they are necessary in making decisions affecting billions of dollars in output, but more importantly the wellbeing of the people. , , ’) price statistics have a long history and many advances have been made in the past to make them useful, yet like many other long established series, they face much more stringent requirements today than in the past, for accuracy, detail, promptness, and other aspects of quality. the control of inflation is a serious problem all around the world; in the united states today, with vast government expenditures and full employment, it is especially delicate and difficult. hence the statistical instruments for measuring and analyzing price movements are watched more closely and their usefulness is greater than ever. there is always danger that too much reliance will be placed on statistical information and that the new and more stringent requirements arc excessive. several years ago in certain bills before congress there were provisions for the use of the series on unemployment as a trigger to authorize almost automatically the initiation of public works programs whenever unemployment had increased by a specified amount for several consecutive months. this appeared to be too much responsibility to be shouldered by such a statistical series. fortunately, this procedure has not been adopted. congress needs more information than it ever has before. statistical in formation is a major part of what is needed. a year ago, the institute of certified public accountants recommended that congress have an information system and staff. recently, at the 3rd annual national colloquium on information retrieval, congressman william s. moorhead proposed that the library of congress establish a computerized information system to serve congress. he proposed that the system tap a11 the other computers in the federal government, “. to secure facts such as economic statistics, demo graphic profiles, and figures on such matters of daily concern to a congress man’s office as funds allocated to his district, and project and contract awards.” he commented further that “computers can render their greatest service to the congress in the area of what might be called advanced decision making.” another evidence of the present rapid evolution of statistical information is the testimony of william h. smith, deputy commissioner of internal revenue before the subcommittee on census and statistics of the house post office and civil service committee in which he reported increasing use of tax returns for collection of statistical data. further indications of change are given by the recent report of the national conference on comparative statistics, emphasizing comparability between the states in the statistics they collect for administrative purposes and cooperation with the federal government in the collection of statistics. for several years economists and other social scientists have been concerned about the preservation and availability of statistical data important for use in scientific research, apart from their original administrative and in formational uses. a recommendation of one of the committees of the social science research council proposed establishment of a national data center. (in a more limited area, several archives of public opinion survey data have already been established under university auspices.) in the new york metropolitan area and in other large urban centers there are proposals for the establishment of great pools of statistical information popularly called “data banks.” a strong impetus to this movement is the remarkable capability of large electronic computers to store, organize, and process great quantities of information at costs which, though large, are only a small fraction of the cost of doing the same work with traditional clerical procedures. a task force headed by professor carl kaysen of harvard university, has been appointed by the director of the budget to study the proposal and review related questions of storing, indexing, collating, selection, standardization, and procedure. its report should have significant implications for most of the federal program in statistics. back of the concept of data banks are several distinct lines of thought. first, there is the long felt need for more convenient and more effective ways to find data in the custody of an agency of government other than those agencies normally expected to have such data. more than three years ago, this need was discussed in a special report by a subcommittee of our census advisory committee, in proposing an analytic index of federal statistics. hauser and leonard’s book on government statistics for business use, was a guide directed very much to meeting this need. various guides to unpublished data have been prepared. no publication, however, can perform the full functions of a live reference service, backed by the searching capabilities of large electronic data storage and retrieval equipment. the second line of thought centers in exploiting the capacity of storing data on tape and disc for rapid and inexpensive search and recovery. today there is some speculation that many manuscripts, currently published as books and other printed communications, could go directly into electronic memories, making printing unnecessary. this may be wholly unrealistic for popular fiction. however, for the tabulations of statistical data, other than certain tables used so frequently that they are likely to be found in the statistical abstract, the possibility of obtaining tabulations custom made according to the user’s own specifications, makes this wild speculation very attractive. it is especially so for tabulations by small areas which can be defined in terms of geographic coordinate systems, a possibility now being explored by the census bureau for all cities. included in this line of thought is the possibility that respondents may furnish the data to the federal government on tape, thereby using their own data systems to provide the information at a saving of time and effort. from there it is easy to envisage a system of instant statistics, transmitted to the statistical agency as soon as they are generated by events and entered in the records of the respondent. the stock exchange and commodity exchange tickers, as well as the department store systems that immediately report each sale to a central inventory control office, are already producing instant data. a third line of thinking emphasizes the advantage of combining information from many sources. the purpose is both to increase the number of variables that can be interrelated and to improve the accuracy of the information through matching and cross checking. it also carries the possibility that respondents need not be bothered by repeated questions about facts that they have already furnished to some other agency, if not to the same agency at an earlier date. in the early 1940s, a commission headed by the late lowell j. reed made a study of the advisability of establishing a population register that would be a repository of information, starting at birth and available to each person when he needs it for legal or other purposes. at that time it did not seem practicable, though the use of past censuses to establish proof of age had already demonstrated the need for such a system. at this point, we touch a development that may have profound consequences for statistics, growing concern about invasion of privacy and violation of fundamental rights of individuals to be protected against exploitation, even for the advancement of medicine and science. only a week ago, the new york times asked in an editorial, “can personal privacy survive the ceaseless advances of the technological juggernaut? george orwell foresaw the logical end of this trend in a device that would enable ‘big brother’ to keep an eye on everyone anywhere. the orwellian nightmare would be brought very close indeed if congress permits the proposed computer national data center to come into being.” with only a few exceptions, the protest against the invasion of privacy is directed, not at statistics but at wiretapping, eavesdropping, psychological testing, police interrogation, and business espionage. this spring there has been a series of letters in science, on the ethical problems of medical experiments and psychological experiments conducted without the subjects’ full understanding of the nature of the experiment and consent to what may be objectionable to them. while these practices are unrelated to the collection of statistical data, the general attitudes associated with them readily spill over to some of the sensitive questions asked in statistical inquiries. at the present moment, there is discussion of the advisability of asking questions about religion and race on the 1970 census of population. adverse reactions to some of the questions asked in a survey of equality of opportunity in education also illustrate the problem. the history of statistics is replete with instances in which the coverage and accuracy of important series were degraded by uncooperative respondents, many of whom felt, no doubt, that they in turn were being subjected to un reasonable requests. senator tobey’s bill to remove the income question fro111 schedules prepared for use in the 1940 census of population, is a case in point. statisticians regularly safeguard the reports they receive from firms and individuals. we recognize a responsibility comparable to that of lawyers to their clients and physicians to their patients in not revealing personal and private information. under the provisions of various laws providing for the collection of statistics, assurance is given to many respondents that their reports will be handled confidentially and not used for purposes of taxation, regulation, prosecution, or any purpose other than the preparation of statistical summaries in which their identities will not be revealed. several years ago in the st. regis paper company case the supreme court drew a fine line between the actual reports, to which it gave legal sanctuary, and copies of those reports retained in the files of the respondent, to which it denied protection. the development of data banks may complicate this already delicate line of defense, but statisticians are committed to provide full protection by dependable safeguards. further discussion of the general problem of personal records may be helpful. dr. stanton wheeier of the russell sage foundation has commissioned fifteen reports on the problem of information control and the dossier, including problems of access to dossiers, the kinds of information that develops within them, and the uses to which they are put. such studies may allay unreasonable fears, as well as reveal such dangers as may exist in cumulative record systems. in some cities, local ordinances regulate house to house canvassing and inter viewers have to obtain a license from the police. this is not likely to be a problem for government interviewers and it may help to preserve the good will from which such interviewers benefit at the present time. the users of statistical information owe a great debt to the respondents who furnish that information and greater efforts may be made in the future to enhance their cooperation and protect their interests. we must work to this end. in the face of all these changes: more urgent and more exacting demands for statistics, the introduction of electronic computers and increasing sophistication in their use, mounting concern about the dangers of centralized data files, and other trends of our time, we must remind ourselves that the fundamental obligation of many statisticians remains the day by day work of operating existing systems of statistical reporting and of making such improvements as the circumstances permit. others among us have responsibility for training ever larger numbers of students and directing research. these basic functions must not be slighted in the effort to make major advances and satisfy new needs. neither should they divert us completely from making a strong effort to respond to the challenges of our time and of the future. one of the privileges that is enjoyed by a president in offering his presidential address, is that there is no provision for discussion from the platform or from the floor. like some of my predecessors, however, i hope to stir up discussion outside this room and for some days to come. hence, i wish at this point to give you some guesses about statistical developments in the near future. 1) the development of statistical information and inference will extend out ward into new fields as well as upward to more intensive development in the older fields. it may well be so rapid in spreading outward that, while the quality of work in each field is steadily improving, the average quality over all fields may decline. 2) the present shortage of qualified statisticians will get worse before it gets better. we will compete for talent on less than favorable terms against some of the more glamorous opportunities now open to young people. we will provide refresher courses and advanced training to statisticians already well along in their careers, but not enough to make maximum use of their potentialities. moreover, ever larger numbers of opportunities at the higher levels of responsibility will open for our best qualified members of the profession and some of these opportunities will take them away from active statistical work. 3) there will be more expressions of dissatisfaction from public and private sources concerning the kinds and quality of statistical information available for general use. this will reflect the fact that old users as well as new have come to expect more from what we offer them, that in using statistics more intensively they have become aware of certain deficiencies and become disillusioned, that the limitations of the systems in which they seek to use the statistics are too readily projected on the data, and that they are impatient with the inertia of government. professor oskar morgenstern’s critical book on the accuracy of economic observations may well be followed by even more severe criticism from the newer generation of cost effectiveness analysts, operations researchers, and management scientists as well as the ever larger number of natural scientists who can be expected to involve themselves in the problems of population growth, economic development, education, city planning, and public administration. one such critic recently claimed that “because of the ease with which data may now be collected and processed, in some technical, economic, political, and social fields, we are almost being studied to death. many of the studies serve to obscure rather than illuminate the central issues to be examined for effective decision making.” almost in the same breath, he said, “. any data collection must be considered an integral part of the systems analysis process. when this precept is ignored, considerable misplaced effort will result. these difficulties will increase as the complexity of the systems increase, for few limits can be placed on the quantity of data that might be pertinent. ” 4) in spite of, and perhaps partly because of, such dissatisfaction, we will find more support for good statistical work and better understanding of what is required to acquire dependable data. increasingly the users of statistical in formation will recognize their stake in the quality and strength of statistical programs, as many users did twelve years ago when the threatened collapse of much of the economic statistics program of the census led to a thorough going examination of the value of these data conducted by the intensive review committee. there will be more crises before the value of statistical programs is sufficiently well assessed and established. 5 ) there will be a revival of training in those aspects of statistical work that are concerned with the acquisition, processing, and management of data as distinct from analysis and inference. statistical curricula in the universities are weak in this direction. statistical agencies can do more than they now do to transmit their know how and to codify their methods. 6) mathematical statistics will be developed more broadly and will con tribute more significantly to the aspects of data acquisition than in the past. the development of useful models of response error has lagged far behind the mathematical formulation of sampling operations which in recent years has contributed so greatly to their improvement. the seasonal adjustment of time series has only recently benefitted from the powerful tool of spectral analysis. these are but a few of the directions in which the value of statistical information can be enhanced by sound application of the mathematical branch of statistical theory. 7) more attention will be given to the definitions and explanations that ac company the numerical part of statistical information. too often statistics are treated merely as sets of numbers or at most, as numbers whose meanings can be taken for granted. rigorous care in the manipulation of the numbers must be matched with equal care in the manipulation and transmission of their meanings since the link between each quantity and the description of what it measures is the essential part of all statistical data. this will lead to useful discussion about the congruence, or lack thereof, between statistical concepts as defined for purposes of measurement, on the one hand, and the formal con cepts of the social and natural sciences to which they should correspond, on the other. this problem is closely tied to the dissatisfaction noted in point 3. 8) partly for the reasons just cited, there will be closer working relations be tween statisticians and members of other scientific and professional groups. there are many tasks that no one group can do adequately by itself. 9) there will be more regular use of statistical information in management and administration. the two most recent past presidents of our association are university presidents and show, as did general francis a. walker, dr. edmund e. day and dr. lowell j. reed that a career in statistics is good preparation for executive responsibility. and need i remind you of how splendidly another past president, miss gertrude cox, has confirmed this in the ad ministration of statistical research. now, if these guesses are even partially correct, there are some evident tasks for our association to undertake with our own efforts and in conjunction with the institute of mathematical statistics, the biometric society and other societies sharing similar interests. this is no place to detail the work to be done, but i will sketch it in outline. 1) we need to extend and improve the teaching of statistics and to bring more talented young people into statistical careers. a recent review of reports of scientific research published in science over a three month period, found 8 of 16 tests of significance faulty. it suggested that (‘there are too many weekend statisticians, who don’t know much about the art, but know what they like.” this is to say, “there are far too few weekday statisticians and too little effective consulting.” 2) we need really excellent expository articles on major aspects of statistics and more refresher courses for statisticians to help them keep pace with new developments. 3) we need more cooperation among various government agencies and private organizations, national, state and local, to improve and standardize major statistical series. 4) we need more review and evaluation by independent committees such as those that examined the kinsey reports, the tv ratings, and various parts of the government statistics program from time to time. concurrently, we should encourage effective tests and calibrations conducted by the statistical agencies themselves. 5 ) we need to strengthen and sustain high standards of professional, scientific, and scholarly work among statisticians everywhere and public recognition of the value of these standards to users and other beneficiaries of sound statistical work. 6) we need to cultivate public understanding and appreciation of statistical information and inference. the views that statistics are deceptive or devoid of the human element or untrustworthy as evidence, are all too prevalent. the expression “only a statistical relationship” reveals only too clearly our failure to explain the statistical aspects of experimentation and of other sources of the evidence commonly assumed to show causation. we need to write for the lay inan and find ways to make statistics less dry, dull, and mysterious. 7) we need to improve our organization and program of activities so that we can accomplish these things, so that we can respond quickly and well to new developments and advance as we find opportunities to do so. your officers with other members of the board and council are formulating plans and investigating their feasibility for an enlargement of the activities of the national office, more effective service to and cooperation with chapters, development of our publications and other steps by which our association can accomplish our objectives more effectively in the future. we naturally think in terms of appointing a full time executive director as one means of doing this, but we are not falling into the mistake of assuring that any one man can do what we must all do together. there will be more work for all of us, whatever the specific arrangements are for staffing the national office. we owe a special debt of gratitude to the memory of sam weiss and to don riley for building up our program to its present stage of development. we owe an even greater debt of gratitude to all those officers and members who served voluntarily on our committees, in our chapters, in our publications, and in other ways necessary to conduct our program of activities and realize our objectives. as we face the rapidly changing world of the future, we want to maintain the momentum of past progress, we want to boost our efforts to a new level of effectiveness, one that is appropriate to the realization of our new opportunities. we aim to satisfy to the best of our ability the urgent demand for a wider range and higher quality of statistical information and for the extraction of sound and valuable inferences that will help solve the important problems of the day. the future calls for unprecedented accomplishments ; by our combined effort we can do much more than we now dare to hope.

Mosteller","1940-1969","﻿our 1967 committee on publications, chaired by david l. wallace, found that many statistical association members desired more review and survey papers. these have been hard to come by, and so as my last act before leaving office, i decided to provide a short survey paper on some related ideas in a field where nearly all of us sometimes work that of contingency tables. these ideas are largely available in the literature, and yet they have not often been put together, though i. j. good's monograph [9] and leo goodman's many papers form good sources. but my paper is not intended as a review of the literature, only as a survey of one set of ideas about estimation in the analysis of contingency tables. i fear that the first act of most social scientists upon seeing a contingency table is to compute chi square for it. sometimes this process is enlightening, sometimes wasteful, but sometimes it does not go quite far enough. example 1. contextuality of present day english in my first and only chi square example, i draw on kucera and francis's attractive and informative 1967 book entitled computational analysis of presentday english [13]. the authors collected 500 samples of writing published about 1961, each sample of length about 2,000 words (but not exactly) these selections come from 15 different genres as follows a. press reportage b. press editorial c. press reviews d. religion e. skills and hobbies f. popular lore g. belles lettres, biography, etc. h. miscellaneous (gov'tese) number of samples 44 27 17 17 36 48 75 30 number of samples j. learned and scientific 80 k. fiction: general 29 l. fiction: mystery and detective 24 m. fiction: science 6 n. fiction: adventure and western 29 p. fiction: romance and love story 29 r. humor 9 total number of samples 500 to see whether high frequency words were distributed nearly independent of context as defined by the 15 genres, the authors computed chi square on the frequencies of occurrences of the 100 most used words. table 1 exemplifies this for the word the. they found, with 14 degrees of freedom, that all the words are distributed in a manner significantly different from random according to the size of the samples from the several genres that is, all 100 words were somewhat contextual as based upon the multinomial model. the smallest chi square was 46, which is about 6 standard deviations away from the expected value of 14, and the largest is over 5,000, or about 1,000 standard deviations from the null. table 1. example of distribution of 69961 the's into 15 genres (kucera and francis [13]) genres a b c d e f g h frequency 6385 3961 2370 2480 4757 6976 10758 4621 expected 6122 5 3764.8 2441.6 2386.1 5009 1 6711.0 10500.6 4311.5 percent 7 19 7.26 6 70 7 17 6.55 7 17 7.07

ioooxf,/69971 9.8 to those of us who are used to straining for statistical significance, these strong results will be refreshing. some may say that they did not expect the words to be distributed randomly, but that is not the point, the real point is that the authors have a lot of data. they can therefore magnify modest deviations. for example, the number of uses of the word the in their list is 69,971. distribute that into 15 categories nearly evenly and one can still get a huge value of chi square. ab table 1 shows they got 688. having established that the distributions are different from random kucera and francis's question is answered. suppose that we wish to go further and ask which words are more contextual and which words less. for this we do not want chi square itself, but chi square divided by sample size. the reason is that in the chi square formula the term (observed expected) 2 expected doubles when observed and expected are doubled, and is multiplied by k when both are multiplied by k. thus the size of chi square for a given departure from a random distribution is approximately proportional to sample size, a cause for rejoicing when we want to detect differences, but an interfering variable when we want to compare departures from proportional distributions. i have divided chi square by n to give us a suitable measure of contextuality in this problem, a measure that makes it possible to compare different words. for convenience, i have multiplied this by 1,000 for making comparisons. among the 100 most frequently used words the three with the least values of x 2/n were the preposition, the conjunction, and the article to, and, and the, with contextuality scores 6.2, 6.9, and 9.6. nevertheless, their chi square values were 33rd, 43rd, and 79th largest counting from the bottom. thus chi square alone can be misleading if we want to estimate degree of contextuality. the three most contextual words were the pronouns her, your, and she, a finding which agrees with the experience wallace and i had in our analysis of the federalist (21] where we were forced to toss out all pronouns as too contextual. however, i am not primarily discussing chi square tonight, and i introduced it here to emphasize estimation in contrast to testing for significance. example 2. measuiung association by the cross product ratio let us turn first to the classical 2 x 2 table, as illustrated in table 2. the letters a, b, c, and d can be thought of as counts or unnormalized proportions, but think of them as population values rather than samples. for concreteness, we might think of a as a high grade in a course and not a as a not so high grade, of b as male and not b as female. then the tables illustrate some possible degrees of association between grades and sex. table 2 6 illustrates how we might obtain a 2 x 2 table by cutting a bivariate distribution f by lines parallel to its x and y axes. if we refer tables 2 3, 2 4, and 2 5 to a bivariate normal to discover the correlations required to produce them, we find from pearson's tables [22], the pearsonian correlation coefficients p = 0.35, 0.29, and 0.25, in that order. let us turn to an entirely different way of thinking about the association in the 2 x 2 table. note that table 2 4 is obtained from table 2 3 by doubling the number of men and by multiplying the number of women by 10. in other words, the men are no better on the average than they were before, and the women are no better either, there are just more of them. why should that change the degree of association? it is, of course, easy to call attention to the bivariate normal as an explanation. but that is not the point, the point is that it is reasonable to think of the association between sex and grades as independent of the relative numbers of men and of women, and indeed of the numben:; of a's and not a's. why should tripling the number of a's and halving the number of not a's in each category (to get from table 2 4 to 2 5) have any effect upon the basic association in the table? one reasonable answer is that it should not. we might instead think of a contingency table as having a basic nucleus which describes its association and think of all tables formed by multiplying elements in rows and columns by positive numbers as forming an equivalence class a class of tables with the same degree of association. thus tables 2 3, 2 4, and 2 5 fall into the same equivalence class under this definition, and table 2 2 for any positive values of the r's and the c's is in the same equivalence class (has the same degree of association) as table 2 1. table 2 2 can be obtained by multiplying elements in row 1 of table 2 1 by r1, row 2 by r2, column 1 by c1, and column 2 by c2. we shall suppose that a, b, c, and dare all strictly positive. an index of association that is invariant under these row and column multiplications is the cross product ratio ad (r1c1a) (r ,d) a= = be (r1c2b)(rtc1c) t; > 0, c; > 0, i = 1, 2. (i) in our numerical examples, tables 2 3, 2 4, and 2 5 give a= 8/3. the quantity a runs fromto co and a= 1 corresponds to independence. (if one wanted a correlation like quantity he might first take the logarithm of a to get some symmetry, since a and 1/a clearly correspond to the same degree of association in opposite directions and then to map onto the interval from 1 to + 1, for example by using the arc tangent. a good set of references on the cross product ratio is to be found in goodman [11 ]. by writing a c a b = aand = a ' b d c d we can interpret a as the number by which to multiply the odds on one side of a 2x2 table (c/ d or bj d) in order to equate them to those on the other side (ajb or ajc, respectively). plackett [23] has developed continuous bivariate families of distributions for which association measured in the cross product manner is natural. it turns out that for given continuous margins g for x and h for y and a given a one can always construct a joint cumulative distribution f having the property that when it is cut anywhere by lines parallel to the x and y axes the probabilities in the four quadrants viewed as a contingency table have the invariance property. does the family of bivariate normal distributions have the property? alas, no. to help show this we computed table 3 which gives the values of a for the bivariate normals with correlation coefficient p = 25, 50, 75, and standard deviations u,.=u11 =1 at the cutting points where x andy take values 0, 5, 1, 1.5, 2. these a's were readily obtained from pearson's tables of the bivariate normal [ 22]. as the correlation increases, the variation in values of a increases. another way to appreciate the difference between the normal and the invariant distributions is to develop the invariant distribution with unit normal margins and then find the value of p that makes the cumulative of a normal distribution with normal margins has for equal to an invariant f for a gi'\len a. for a= 2, our table 4 shows p for a variety of cutting points. note that different positions of the cuts require different correlations, instead of identical ones as they would if the invariant distribution were a bivariate normal. next let us illustrate one form of the invariant probability density function. we computed table 5 to show selected ordinates for the joint probability density with uniform margins on the interval fromto 1 that produces a= 2. note that the ordinates at the origin (0, 0) and at (1, 1) are high, at the other corners (0, 1) and (1, o) the ordinates are low, and there is a saddle point in the middle, (!, i). standardizing a 2x2 table we do not have to think about continuous distributions for this sort of situation, however. we can use the idea of association as a way to understand our data better. for example, we might especially arrange the table to have uniform margins on each side in the case of a two way table so as to get a clearer look at the association that is actually occurring. if appropriate it could be viewed as a doubly stochastic matrix of transition probabilities, or conditional probabilities. we can either get a formula to do this or do it by successive iterations. since other related problems require iterations, let us iterate even for a 2x2. let us start with table 6 1. we might as well try to reduce it to a table with unit totals in each row and column. we can convert to probabilities at the end, if we desire. multiply the elements of the first row by 1/110, of the second row by 1/7. this gives, to three decimals, table 6 2. table 6. iterating to a standard 2x2 by row and column multiplications in our example n=2, r=c=1, a=100x2/(5x10)=4. consequently, adjusted d = 2/3, as shown in the lower right hand cell of table 6 4. fonnula (2*) or the quadratic leading to it is probably known to many, and it is readily related to plackett's formula (2) above. example 3. levine's study of occupational mobility let us extend this idea of equivalence classes of association obtained by starting with a given table and generating others by multiplying levels of a given variable by positive constants. we wish to extend it not only to the twoway rxc contingency table but also to the k way r1 xr2 x · · · xrk table. the same technique of standardizing works in these larger tables. we shall illustrate its use for the two way table by results kindly supplied by joel h. levine, [14, 15] who has recently developed and exposited the cross product idea and applied the standardizing technique to glass's british and svalastoga's danish occupational mobility data. in panel 7 1 of table 7 the upper numbers in the cells are the british counts showing the joint distributions of father's and son's occupation distributed into 5 categories, the lower numbers are the danish counts in corresponding categories. the two sets of row data in panel 7 1, quite apart from their differing totals, even in good sized cells show ratios of british to danish counts running from as high as 3 down to 2/5. thus the ratios are far from constant. levine has standardized the two sets separately to have row totals of 100 and column totals of 100, achieved by row and column multiplications. this standardizing shown in panel 7 2 of table 7 equates for britain and denmark the father's original distributions of occupational status and equates the son's distributions as well. again, we can interpret the resulting numbers as transitional or conditional probabilities expressed in percents either son's distribution given the father's category, or father's given the son's. when we look at the result in panel 7 2, we observe that standardizing has brought a great deal of order into the lines of the british table for example, the slump in the middle of father's category 2 is now just part of a smooth descent. furthermore, where the original sets of data appeared rather incompatible, panel 7 2 shows that the numbers in a cell are very similar for the two nationalities. in the sense of having a common nucleus of association, as we have discussed above, it would be fair to say that the two occupational tables are nearly equivalent. it is a great economy of description to find societies having much the same intergenerational mobility, needing only the row and column frequencies to finish the description. example 4. adjusting a joint distribution to given margins while preserving the interactions even though the heading above could be applied to examples 2 and 3, the ideas involved in the next example, seem enough different to be worth special mention. the problem was originally called to my attention by ithiel de sola pool in connection with a study of readership. pool had separate marginal distributions of several variables, such as sex, age, and education for a certain group of readers, but wished to use the joint distribution given by census data to reconstruct as best one can the joint distribution in his group of readers. in doing this, pool wanted to ""preserve the original interactions"" in the cen8us data. he was willing to suppose it reasonable that row, column, and layer multiplications would preserve the original interactions. it is important not to fool oneself here but to recognize that: 1) the concept of ""preserving the original interactions"" does not uniquely define the method of reconstructing cells for the joint distribution (indeed, for the 2x2, we have suggested in example 2 another way to do it by doubly dichotomizing the bivariate normal distribution for fixed p, and we noticed that the result would differ from that of the multiplicative model we plan to use here), and 2) making the assumption that when a subgroup is formed from the parent population the multiplicative invariance is preserved does not make it true (as a vehicle for getting an estimate in ignorance, it has the same status as the use of linear regression in the absence of knowledge of the shape of the function). our two variable example of table 6 could serve as a starter here. read the table in 1,000's. suppose that the original population was composed of llo thousand men, 7 thousand women, 12 thousand high school graduates, and 105 thousand nongraduates. then suppose that we had a subgroup with margins of 1 thousand men, 1 thousand women, and 1 thousand graduates and 1 thousand nongraduates. on the basis of the original joint distribution we wish to make a table (preserving the original association) that estimates the joint distribution in the subgroup. our previous analyses showed that the estimate wou.ld be given by table 6 4 which estimates 667 men nongraduates and 667 women graduates, 333 men graduates and 333 women nongraduates. far from being new, this iterative technique was suggested in 1940 by deming and stephan [5, 6] for the adjustment of tables to make margins fit properly. they did not have in mind the model of the invariance of association under multiplication of rows and columns and so on by positive constants, but thought of the method as an approximation to a least squares process that they were proposing. they extended the iterative scheme to more than two variables ai3 deming and stephan describe [ 5], if one has three dimensions, then he would begin with some margin, say variable 1, and adjust every cell in a given layer by the same multiplicative factor so that the layer added up to the desired total. next get the adjusted marginal totals on variable 2 and adjust each level of variable 2 by multiplying by the factor that makes them add up properly. this will mess up the margin for variable 1, but proceed to variable 3. now start the cycle over again with variable 1. the convergence seems to be quite rapid. naturally, if one had more information about the subgroup, he could use it. for example one might have, as in table 8, a joint distribution for the subgroup on a pair of variables, say x andy, and only marginal information on a third, say z. then one would adjust every cell in a column for fixed x, y values to fit, and then adjust the layers for the levels of z and cycle. for example, suppose that the joint parent population is represented by the 2 x3 x 2 table shown in panel 1 of table 8. let the levels of x, y, and z be x1, x2,

panel 2 the numbers 9 and 7. (let me emphasize that z is not thought to be independent of x and y in the subgroup, i am just describing the state of our knowledge of the subgroup.) let us estimate the joint distribution of x, y, z in the subgroup, admitting now that the x, y association may not be preserved in the subgroup, but otherwise acting as if the multiplicative invariance held. we begin the iteration by adjusting within each x, y column. for example, in the x1, y1 cell, the population margin is 15 and the subgroup margin 5, and so we adjust the 10 and 5 of the xt, yt cells in layers zt and z2 by multiplying each by 5/15. similarly in the xt, y2 column we adjust 5 and 7 by multiplying by 3/12, and so on all through the x, y margin. the result is shown in panel 3 of table 8. the sum of the adjusted values in level zt is 6.95 and the sum of those in level z2 is 9.05. these are used with the subpopulation margins 9 and 7 to adjust each value in the zt layer by multiplying by 9/(total of adjusted values in z level 1) =9/6.95 and by multiplying the adjusted values in z level 2 by 7 /(total of adjusted values in z level 2) = 7 j9.05. this completes one cycle as shown in panel 4 of table 8. the iteration continues by readjusting the x, y table, and after 4 cycles the final result is shown in panel 5 of table 8. example 6. baseline model for preferential marriages the anthropologist a. kimball romney [24], together with his colleagues, has been developing and analyzing a stochastic model for marriage in societies where there are rules or preferences for marriages between certain subgroups (perhaps clans). 'l'he basic model categories. romney conceives of men and women in the community as belonging to different categories, and, while he does not distinguish the categories for men from those for women, let us do that since the model might be useful for other problems. the men belong to categories m 1, m 2, · · · , m k, the women to wl, wt,0' w k· making the numbers of categories equal for the two sexes loses no generality, because we can always add categories with no members. numbers. let category m, have m; members and category w; have w; members, where 1:m, = n men, 1:w; = n women· these individuals are regarded as the pool from which marriages are made. for simplicity here we shall assume equal numbers of men and women in the pool, n men= n womm = n. marriages. romney conceives of the marriage process as having two stages. in the'first stage male female pairs ""meet""; in the second stage those who ""meet"" either marry or do not marry. (do not read too much into the word ""meet""; it is just a label for a stage. the notion of ""meeting"" gives a basis for the population distribution into the categories to have a selection effect. the second stage enables the differential probabilities (preferences) of the various categories for marrying to have effect. probabilities of meeting. at any instant there are m1 unmarried men and w, unmarried women in categories m, and wi. the probability of an !vi, and a w; meeting is taken to be m;w;/ n 2• this is a formal assumption.

it is ix1+lxo+lxo+ix1=t the final i x 1 corresponds to the lower right hand table, where the second marriage added a 1 to its upper left hand comer. the other mean values can be gotten by subtraction and they are: the basic formula can be used to generate expected values for any 2 x 2 initial population. a computer program has been written and expected values to four decimals for all possible initial populations up to and including n =49 have been computed for a few sets of a's. the basic formula can readily be generalized to more categories, but in such generalization, one must have more formulas. here we have, in principle, four formulas for a two by two table because 2 x 2 = 4. but since the table has fixed margins, there is but one degree of freedom. therefore, computing for the (1, 1) cell is enough. in a 3 x 3 table there would be four formulas needed corresponding to the (3 1) (3 1) = 4 degrees of freedom in a 2 x 2 table with fixed margins. more generally, (k 1) 2 formulas would be required. approximation. naturally, it would be good to have an easier way to compute the expected value than a recurrence relation, because it requires a great deal of calculation just to get the answer for one table. one approximation which romney has used regards the a's as the basic numbers determining the degree of association in a contingency table. we then find what multipliers for rows and for columns will produce the required margins either by the iterative scheme in large tables or by equation (2*). we compare the iterative answer with the exact result from the recurrence relation for the same a's for initial populations of size 40. although we have the whole printout both for the iterative scheme and for the exact recurrence relation, a more modest table will spare the eyes and increase understanding. table 9 compares the exact results with the solution of quadratic equation (2*) for a grid of 81 tables from the possible 1681 ( =412) tables with n =40. on the edges of the square, the two formulas agree perfectly. note that the largest deviation is only 0.21. example 8. reporting data based on contingency tables as in the national halothane study in thinking about reporting on his data, the investigator asks how to summarize them, but there are other issues. for example, is it possible that there are better reports than the data itself? not in the usual sense of completeness. but suppose that three somewhat comparable surgical operations are repeatedly association and estimation in contingency tables 17 table 9. a comparison of exact and approximate expected values in upper left hand corner of 2x2 table for romney's marriage model with n=40, various compositions of men and women into the two categories, m and w being the numbers of men and of women in category and marriage probabilities exact values were computed using recurrence formula (2) approximate values were computed from quadratic formula (2*).

(we do, however, need to consider how to warn him that the report is not simply based upon the observed counts in the cell.) as my example, i shall draw on the national halothane study's analysis of death rates following surgery [4]. that study compared the safety of the major anesthetics (halothane, nitrous oxide barbiturate, cyclopropane, ether) as used in surgery in 34 institutions. in every field of statistical activity where we have contingency tables involving many variables, we find that our data thins out so that we cannot make cell to cell comparisons at as fine a level as we could desire. the reasons are well known. the product of the number of levels associated with each variable is the number of cells that has to be considered, and this number gets large very rapidly. for example, in the national halothane study we could have had 34 institutions, 5 anesthetics, 2 sexes, 7 ages, 8 levels of physical status, and these alone (without even considering the 75 different operations) would have accounted for 19,000 cells. yet the study of surgical deaths, a very large one, had only 16,000 deaths based on 856,000 surgical procedures. obviously, one death per cell could scarcely lead to reliable rates for making all the desirable comparisons. naturally, one wants to control for variables such as those we have mentioned different institutions have quite different death rates, there is almost a factor of 2 in the ratio of death rates for males as cornpared to females, and so on. consequently, when we come to compare death rates following various anesthesias and surgery, it is important that we take account of the different frequencies with which different classes of patients participate in the use of the different anesthetics. in the same manner in studies in the social sciences we need to control for many variables in order to make our results more meaningful or more precise. several different ways of handling the problem of the small numbers in the cells have been developed in the course of the halothane study. one of these methods has been developed by yvonne bishop in her doctoral dissertation [ 3]. part of this work appears in the full halothane report [ 4, chapter 3]. the fundamental idea has been developed by birch [2]. the general idea is as follows. when we fit a. multivariate normal distribution to a set of data, we are fitting means, variances, and covariances. this is equivalent to fitting some parameters of several two dimensional marginal distributions. frequently this amount of fitting can be used to represent the multivariate data well. in contingency tables, we could not ordinarily make assumptions of normality (though jerome cornfield tells me that sometimes it works unexpectedly well), but we could consider fitting all two dimensional and even all or some three dimensional margins to the data. this approach would borrow strength for the cell estimation from the margins by giving up the contributions of the higher order effects. for example, if we had 6 variables and fitted three dimensional margins, then we would make sure that all 20 sets of three variables were properly represented by their frequencies at each level of each variable, by their two dimensional associations as represented by all 15 two way marginal tables, and even their second order interactions as represented by their 20 three dimensional margins, one for every triple of variables. what would be sacrificed would be the thirdand higher order effects arising from the special interrelations of sets of 4 or more variables. this is not to deny the possible existence of such third order interactions. rather the thought is that it may be profitable for cell estimation purposes to ignore them. a simple analogy arises in ordinary regression where we often fit a straight line or a parabola when we know very well that the true state of affairs is more complicated, and sometimes even when we have a clear picture of how the true state of affairs should be represented. we do this because our estimation may be better when using a simple model in a limited range, even though the model is wrong, than when fitting the correct model. bishop has explored the fitting of twoand three dimensional margins to these large sets of data, and has developed ways of assessing what models (what sets of margins) give the better representation. these ideas applied to a contingency table relate to the multiplicative model, and therefore to the idea of taking logarithms of cell entries and treating these as measurements through the usual analysis of variance methods not of testing but of estimation. if we think of the cell entries as the true probabilities and suppose that these are not zero, then the case of complete independence leads us to think of replacing the observed entries by their logarithms, which would just be the sum of the logarithins of the marginal probabiliti , whatever the number of variables of the table. corresponding to this idea for populations, suppose that we want to fit the cells of an observed two way contingency table but neglect the possible ""interaction"" effects. all we do is compute the usual table of ""expected values"" either by multiplication or by logarithmic methods, using the two one variable margins. in a similar vein, we can, if we wish, construct a logarithmic model with some but not necessarily all possible interactions, for three or more variables. fitting less than the full model, but more than that for complete independence arises only when we have three or more variables. therefore we do not think much about it as long as we deal with oneand two way tables. many practical applications were made of this idea in the national halothane study to help with the comparison of anesthetics. in addition by its use we were able to come much closer to representing the unique case than usual. ordinarily when a physician asks about death rates associated with operations, he has only single variables or at most pairs upon which to appraise the patient's chances. in this study we were able to construct tables that use sex, age, physical condition, and operation all simultaneously. thus a physician considering an operation would be able to consider past results for a class of patients that represented his patient's properties better than usual because more variables would be fitted. (if i were redoing the study now, i would use both a finer classification and more variables.) table 10 shows a portion of the death rates in the halothane study for four frequently performed operations that have high death rates. the rates were obtained by fitting all 6 two dimensional margins for the 4 variables mentioned above. the tables of deaths and the tables of estimated exposed were fitted separately and then the death rates were estimated from looxfitted deaths/(fitted estimated exposed+fitted deaths) to reduce the mean square error (see [4, part iv, chapter 2, appendix 3 ]). i shall describe the fitting of the cells of a three variable contingency table by fitting all the two variable margins but allowing no third order effects. the method is closely related to the one that we used earlier in example 4 to adjust the cells so that we got a certain two way margin and another one variable margin. this time, the cell values are available for the determination of the t.hree two way margins say xy, xz, and yz, but we wish to reconstitute the body of the table omitting the effects of three dimensional interaction. if we replace every cell in the body of the table by a 1, we have a starting table that represents complete independence. (alternatively, we could start with a table estimated by the product of the 3 one dimensional marginal cells. in the usual notation the estimate for cell ijk would be nx; +i tl[++,.fn1, the usual generalization of the ""expected value"" for a cell based on marginal totals and complete independence. nothing much seems to be gained by using these ""expected values"" instead of 1's as initial values; but the point of the 1's is that they stand for independence.) then we compute all the two way margins for this starting table. again we apply the iteration scheme. for example, suppose that we want to fill in a 2 x 2 x 2 table so that all the two way margins fit but there is no three variable effect in the table. then we pick one two way marginal table, say the xy table and adjust for each xy pair all the z's (here 1's) by multiplying them by the correct marginal total from the original table, divided by the sum obtained from the starting table just as we did in example 4. after this has been done for every xy pair, one continues in the same way with the xz pairs and then the yz pairs. usually totals will not add up properly at the close of this operation and so one will need to continue the iteration, cycling through each two way table systematically. again the convergence is usually rather rapid. in the special case of the 2x2x2 table there is a check that one can make by multiplying certain cells together. if the layout is layer 1 layer 2 then adgf = cbeh when there is no three variable effect (bartlett's formula [1]) table 11 sketches an example. this idea extends smoothly to several variables with various numbers of levels for each variable. it is also not restricted to the fitting of all two way margins. in the presence of several variables, one can fit all three way margins, for example, and we have done this for some tables in the national halothane study. we are not restricted to fitting all margins of one size. for example in a fivevariable problem with variables numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 we could fit the three way margin for variables 1, 2, 3, fit the two way margin of variable 4 with each of 1, 2, and 3, and independently fit the one variable margin of variable 5. bishop's work [3] on fitting and testing in such complicated problems is instructive. example 7. baybs ian approach to estimation the idea of ""general purpose"" reporting of data has been emphasized above. it may occur to you that the method just described is rather discontinuous from the point of view of dimensionality. for example, when w e fit the two way margins we allow all one variable margins to have their full effect, and we allow all two variable effects to be fully represented, but then we suddenly and completely disallow effects of three or more variables simultaneously. this is not the only possibility. one ought to be able to allow effects of different order to contribute with differential weights. ideas like this have been suggested by stein [ 25] and lindley [ 16], and of course, i. j. good [ 9] has explored various approaches to cell estimation in contingency tables. recently fienberg and holland [8] have added to this estimation literature. let us take it in two steps, first for the multinomial and then for the two way table. and perhaps we could jackknife it [20, chapter e] to unbias it and to get some notion of its uncertainty. this estimate is closely related to good's result [9 ]. application 1. a sample of size n =51 was drawn from 6 multinomial categories as shown in table 12. the estimated value of k was 1.65, and the jackknifed value 1.61. using it we get the estimate in the last line of table 12. although the usual estimate ofwas increased to 0.5% and 65% was reduced to 63%, the total change from x,jn to b,. is small. the standard error of is 0.55, according to the jackknife. application 2. to see what happens when data are very sparse consider table 13 which has several o's and few data otherwise. estimation in two way tables is more in the spirit of the rest of our discussion. one might suppose that an estimate in a two way table would be composed of two components, the first based upon the ""expected value"" as computed in the usual chi square analysis, and the second based on the actual observation. thus we would take advantage both of the strength of estimation available when we have independence and of the two variable effect present in the cell itself. using the quadratic loss mentioned earlier, fienberg and holland [8] get the following weighted sum as an optimum estimate i ii table 14 gives observed counts and fitted counts based on this formula (multiplied by n) for kahn's data from dorn's study of smoking and mortality among u.s. veterans [12, p. 119]. in the present instance, the counts are not adjusted much kj(n +k) is about 1/14 and so we move about 7% toward the ""expected value"" estimate from the ""observed value"". example 8. regression estimates for cell entries in contingency tables if you think of estimating probabilities in a table containing several empty cells as a hazardous occupation, let me introduce you to some work of leo goodman [10] who estimates au the cells in a two way contingency table on the basis only of the margins, without assuming independence. he performs this magic by making certain assumptions about a set of twoway tables, such as that they all have the same transition probabilities, and then he uses the variation in the margins from one table to another as a lever for prying out information through a regression approach. if only the marginal distributions had been known, the estimates of pn and p21 would have led to the estimated tables shown in the bottom panel of table 15. note that these fitted values agree well with the observed values, which will not be known in problems where we do such fitting. the regression equation for each table can be represented as a line in the pu, p12 plane. the reason the regression model works so well in this example is that the three lines intersect almost at the same point and that the true parameter values all lie close to the points of intersection. but the true point could lie anywhere on the lines, consequently a common intersection is no guarantee that the true values have been found. we can use considerably more empirical research on the applicability of this method. what with bayesian help, perhaps we will be able to get along without the margins too! summary in this paper i have stressed estimation rather than testing in the analysis of complex contingency tables and i have called attention to an attitude toward association different from the usual. i especially illustrated a statistically neglected notion that i call ""reporting"" (perhaps i should call it ""statistical reporting"") for probabilities and rates obtained from contingency tables. i feel that further research, both mathematical and empirical, can improve statistical reporting and make it more useful to practitioners such as social scientists and physicians by emphasizing estimation for very detailed classes of individuals. although the statistician cannot hope to match the unique case, i believe that he can take steps to come much closer to it in the future than he has in the past. although i have illustrated the reporting problem here for contingency tables involving several variables, i do not restrict it to them. the problem is that of estimating for general purposes the values of a function of several variables.

also had our share of suc cesses, they are not as well remembered nor as numerous as we should like. recently, however, we have begun to pay more attention to the record, and a substantial body of evidence on forecasting performance has accumulated. in this paper i propose to review this record, try to arrive at b balanced appraisal, and offer some suggestions for improvement. i put the economic forecasters among our members in a properly humble t mood, let me cite a few of the incidents that have cast doubt on our fore casting abilities. back in 1929, few economists were pessimistic about the outlook, and fewer still were as pessimistic as would have been appropriate in view of the depression that left the nation prostrate. one of the statistical casualties was a system of forecasting known as the harvard abc curves, developed in the 1920's by warren persons a former president of this asso ciation and others, inchding a young man who was destined to become our next president, ross eckler. the three curves a representing speculative activity, i.e., stock prices, b measuring business activity, and c reflecting monetary ease or tightness were used in formulating periodic reports on the business outlook. historical studies of the pre world war i period had shown that series of the a type tended to move early in the business cycle, the b type next, and the c type last, with the lagging upturns in the c series preceding downturns in the a type. the economic logic of the sequence was that tight money and high interest rates led to a decline in the prospects for business expansion and a drop in stock prices, whereupon businessmen cut back or postponed their commitments for further expansion, causing a recession in business activity. this in turn led to an easing of money and lower interest rates, which eventually improved business prospects, whereupon stock prices presidential addreaa delivered at the 128th annual meeting of the 4mericsn statistical association. august 21,1968, pittsburgh, pa. i am greatly indebted to arthur f. burns, solomon fabricant, milton friedman, ruth p. mack, john r. meyer, and juliua shiskin for comments on an earlier draft. for statistical awistanee i am obliged to charlotte boschr, dorothy o'brien and the late sophie sakowitr. turned up, then business activity, and finally interest rates again in a new round. such, in brief, was the theory. in the depression of 1920 21 the harvard economists had some success in applying it. but in 1929 they maintained an optimistic view and failed to foresee either the downturn or the debacle. this failure dealt a death blow to the abc curves as an influential forecasting scheme a fate that was not altogether deserved, as i shall note. a second prominent forecasting failure occurred in 1945, at the end of world war 11. the expected curtailment of military spending and the return of soldiers to the civilian labor force led many economists to predict a serious postwar depression and mass unemployment. they failed to anticipate ade quately the resilience of the private economy, the power of the pent up de mand for consumer goods, and the wherewithal provided by accumulated liquid assets. certain econometric models were among the casualties. based on relationships that fitted the prewar period, they were unable to cope with the transition from a war to a peacetime economy. the reputation of model builders suffered a setback from this failure. nevertheless, they displayed a resilience that rivaled that of the economy itself and quickly shook off any sense of defeat, while striving to learn from the experience. model building has since become a flourishing industry. the next failure on my list is dated 194549. late in 1948 signs of a reces sion began to appear, but there were also signs of inflation. president truman and his council of economic advisers concentrated their attention on the inflationary threat. it failed to materialize, while the recession did. this fore casting failure found the government, during the first half of 1949, fighting the wrong war. another significant delay in recognizing the onset of recession occurred in 1957. the federal reserve board failed to foresee the recession that began in mid summer, continued its policy of restraint by raising the discount rate in august, and began to take anti recessionary measures only in november. again, as in 1949, the forecasters were concerned about inflatiozi when the problem was recession. in 1965, on the other hand, a forecasting error of the opposite kind occurred. administration economists failed to foresee the power ful inflationary pressures that were developing, and urged policies that would continue to stimulate aggregate demand. these are some of the better known exhibits from the economic forecaster’s chamber of horrors or should i say errors. they reveal fallibility and the need to strive for better results, but they also demonstrate the importance of forecasting in guiding public policy. at the same time, these examples present a one sided picture. we need a fairer and more systematic review, indeed, a statistical review of forecasting performance. some work recently undertaken at the national bureau of economic research provides a basis for such an appraisal. this is not, of course, the first such effort. the work of cox [2] in the 1920’s and the more recent studies of okun [9], stekler [ll, 121, suits [13], theil [14, 151, and others have con tributed to our knowledge of the validity of general economic forecasts. but the national bureau &iidy has produced a new aud more extensive body of forecasting short term economic cbanqki 3 data of this sort, reflecting the great proliferation of forecasting activity in recent years.' i1 the national bureau's collection of short term general economic forecasts pertains largely to the period since world war 11. it covers various economic aggregates such as gross national product and its major components, industrial production, employment, unemployment, and price levels, as well as business cycle turning points. the forecasts were made by economists in private busi ness and financial firms, in government agencies, in universities and research institutions. some of the forecasts have been regularly published and widely disseminated, others were limited to private use. the record provides materials for analyses of the frequency and magnitude of error, of the factors contributing to error, and of the potential value of techniques for reducing error. it can also be used to analyze the ways in which forecasts or expectations are formed and how the phenomenon of forecasting itself contributes both to the generation of business cycles and to their amelioration. i shall refer to only a small part of this record, both for lack of time and because studies of it are still under way. first, let us consider what it tells about the forecasting and recognition of business cycle turning points. suppose the objective of the forecaster is to foresee reversals in the direction of change in the annual level of gross national product; that is, to determine whether gnp will decline between this year and the next if it has been going up, or whether it will rise if it has been going down. such reversals in annual data are not frequent, but when they do occur, it is important to know about them since a downturn may mean the onset of a recession and an upturn the beginning of recovery.2 victor zarnowitz has assembled the record of 126 such forecasts made towards the end of the calendar year for the year ahead, mostly covering the period 1953 to 1963.a if the forecasts had accurately predicted the first official estimates of gnp made immediately after the year being forecast, there would 1 the national bureau study is under the direction of victor zarnowitz of the university of chicago, and amonp those responsible for various

i the record includes twelve sets of forecasts. smie go back to 1947 and nonie go 8 8 far forward an 1965. but the bulk of the forecasts (115 out of i261 pertain to 1053 63. six of the sets are forecast8 made by individuals or a team; the other six are averuger of separate forecam made by the memtera of small or large groups. hence the total number of forecasts included f a r exceeds 128. the averaging of group forecasts. it should be noted, ten& to reduce the rmge of error. have been 43 turning point predictions, or about one for every three forecasts. in fact, 34 turning point predictions were made, or about one for every four forecasts. this is better, of course, than assuming that next year will always produce a turning point; it is better than the almost equally naive assumption that gross national product is a series of random numbers (in which case approximately 84 turning points would have been forecast); it is better than the slightly more sophisticated assumption that the change in gnp is random (which would have produced about 63 turning points) ; and of course it is better than assuming that no turning point would occur at all! in short, the per formance is clearly better than pure guesswork. the forecasters not only had some success in predicting the total number of turning points, but were also fairly successful in judging when the turm would occur. of the 43 turning points that should have been forecast, 32 were predicted and only 11 were missed. of the 34 forecasts that turning points would occur, only three were in error. hence there were only 14 turning point errors, which is a record of 89 percent accuracy in identifying years that would mark reversals in the movement of gnp. table 1 gives these results in the 4 this last assumption would not be wide of the mark if the revised gnp estimates (as of 1965) were the criterion of what happened rather than the first official eatimatea. since the revised annual estimates contain turning points only in 1948 and 1949 (cf. n. z), and few of the forecast records go back that far, the number of turning point predictions consistent with perfect accuracy in terms of the revised would be 3. forecasting short term economic change 3 form of a contingency table, together with some measures of association and a test of significance! while economists can take heart from this performance, it must be recalled that these are forecasts for the ensuing year made in the late autumn or early winter. the turning point, which in annual data is conventionally dated at inid year, is then actually past. that is to say, if at the end of 1968 a gnp forecast showed 1969 to be lower than 1968, 1968 would be the turning point, but the year would be over. late autumn is the season of the year when most forecasting is done; records of forecasts made earlier in the year are less abun dant. the compilation of 14 annual forecasts made near the rhiddle of the year for the calendar year ahead presents a very different pidture (panel 2 of table 1). six turning points should have been predicted and five were, but the timing was poor. of the six turns that should have been foiecast, three were not, and of the five predicted turns, two were false signals. the five turning point errors produce an accuracy score of only 64 percent, compared with 89 percent for the forecasts made near the end of the year. this is just barely better than guesswork. forecasts made in mid year must, of course, predict the rest of the current year as well as the next. in effect, these forecasts are prepared at about the time of the turn, insofar as it can be dated from annual observations. in terms of the monthly dates of business cycle turns in the postwar period, curred before mid year, two mere in july, and three after july. the annual forecasts, therefore, suggests that those made shortly before or shortly after the monthly turn have not been very successful, while those made a few months later have been quite successful. zarnowitz’ materials on annual turning point forecasts of other variables yield another interesting conclusion bearing on this point. it is that the accu racy of forecasts is greater for variables that lag in the business cycle than for those that move coincidentally or lead. turning points in plant and equipment expenditures, which often lag, are forecast more accurately than those in inventory change, which generally lead. consumer prices, which lag, are forecast more accurately than wholesale prices, which move more promptly. hence the visibility of a turning point to a forecaster depends partly on how far ahead he looks, and partly on whether the variable he is looking at moves earlier or later than others that he can observe and relate to it. the national bureau has assembled not only annual forecasts but also quarterly forecasts for several quarters ahead. these provide an additional test of forecasters’ ability, since turns can be dated with greater precision from quarterly than from annual data. quarterly forecasts of turning points depend, in the first instance, on forecasts of direction of change. how well, then, have forecasters predicted the direction of change in gnp between the current quarter and the next, between that quarter and the one beyond it, and so on? a compilation of nearly fifty forecasts of this type (table 2) suggests that fore casters are well aware that gnp generally increases from one quarter to the 6 the teat mumea the observations are statistically independent, which clearly is not the cam. partly because the occurrence of a turning point in one year has a bearing on its occurrence in the next, partly because the several seta of forecaata included probably hsve some influence upon one another m d in any case cover the =me period. thew considerations are likely to mean that the statistical significance is exaggerated by the ordinary teat. next, but possess little ability to predict when declines are coming. for example, out of 35 predicted increases from the current quarter to the next, three fourths turned out to be correct, while only a third of the 9 predicted declines were correct. the combined percentage of correct forecasts 6s percent, is not much better than one would expect if forecasters knew approximately how often declines mould occur, but tossed a coin to decide when they would take place. as for quarterly changes still farther in the future, the forecasters seldom predicted declines at all, and when they did, showed no ability to pick the right occasions. the record for forecasts of semiannual gnp data (from a different group of forecasters) is somewhat better. this is shown in section b of table 2. ninety percent of the predicted increases and 44 percent of the predicted declines from one half year to the next proved correct, for a combined percentage accuracy of 73 percent. from the next half year to the one following that, the accuracy drops to 62 percent, which is not much better than random. the data as a whole suggest that forecasters have yet to establish their ability to detect turning points in aggregate economic activity well in advance of the event. what they do demonstrate is an ability to recognize turrls at about the time or shortly after they occur.g another type of turning point record has been compiled by rendigs fels and c. elton hinshaw [4]. fels developed a system for scoring statements about the business outlook that he applied to the writings of analysts that regularly appear in certain widely read business or financial journals. hinshaw applied the same system to the statements on the outlook recorded in the minutes of the regular meetings of the federal reserve board’s open market committee. chart 1 summarizes part of their results, in terms of the prob ability, as indicated by the statements, that a turuing point soon will be, or has already been reached. the chart shows, first, that there is a clear improvement in the ability to forecast or recognize a turn as the date of an actual turn approaches, and further improvement after it passes. second, the record is better at troughs than at peaks perhaps indicating an optimistic bias, or maybe that troughs are easier to predict and recognize. third, the open pilarltet committee the group in whose hands the monetary policy of the nation largely rests did slightly better than the average of the business analysts. the committee’s a n n u d forecasts made (t) months nffer the turning point forecasts made (z) months before the turning point semiannual quarterly quarterly record in avoiding false signals not, shown in the chart was markedly bbtter t,han that of the analysts. finally, the fels hinshaw study, like zarnowits’, suggests that there is only a modest ability to anticipate turns. before the date of the turn, the indi cated probability attaching to the occurrence of a turning point averages less than 50 percent. a month or so after the turn it is still only a 50 50 proposition. the 75 percent level, or odds of 3 to 1, is reached three or four months after the turn. not until five or six months after the turn is there virtual certainty (9 to 1 odds) regarding the event. in view of the lags in the availability of data, and the fact that major economic indicators rarely reach their turns at the same time, this is not necessarily poor performance. moreover, recognizing a turn in the business cycle a few months after the event does imply some ability to forecast. one must be aware not only of the change in the direction of movement of aggre ate economic activity that is taking place, but also judge its likely magnitude and duration. recognizing business recessions is not the same as recognizing every wiggle on the curve. major, lasting movements must be distinguished from minor interruptions of the trend. the evidence collected shows that fore casters have achieved some success, if not in anticipating the turn, at least in recognizing it rather promptly. 4 i11 most forecasters regard the prediction of turning points as one of the signif icant challenges in their work. it is easy enough, they say, to anticipate con tinuing growth. the crucial test comes at the turning point. that is why i began this review by examining turning point forecasts. on the other hand, it is also true that the chief concern of forecasters is not predicting turning points but predicting the magnitude of h a n g e true, predicting a turning point in the business cycle implies something about the magnitude of change. but this is not entirely satisfactory. missing the turn of a mild recession, say in 1960, is not as serious as missing a 1929. moreover, during the past seven years we have enjoyed a period without any business cycle turning points as commonly defined, so the only mark of a forecaster’s skill in this respect was his ability to avoid characterizing the minor dips, notably in 1962 and 1966, as recessions. it behooves us, therefore, to look at the record of forecasts of mag nitude of change. 7 curiously, in developing and applying their methods (fitting equations, e t a ) many foremtern pay close attention to magnitudes (as in the method of least squares) but pay no particular attention to turning points. this procedure does not seem well suited to producing good forecasts of turning points even though, in the end, this is considered to be one of the crucial tests of good performance. see, for example. the analysis of the commerce department’s model by liebenberg. himch, and popkin 151. would the usb of lagged (poatdated) variables get auch heavy emphasia in econometric models if the forecasting of turning points were a desideratum? the lagged aeries may improve the fit, but it cannot forecast its own turning point, and it may (though it need not) prevent other variables from doing 80. 8 the materials presented rely largely upon two summary measures of forecasting quality: the mean absolute error in forecasts of percentage change. and the correlation coefficient between forecast and actual percentage change. the use of percentage changes rather than first dberences as the form in which to expreaa the forecasts has the advantage of facilitating comparisons among different variables. also, where the variables experience growth or inflationary trends, it puts the most recent changes more nearly on the same level as earlier changes. logarithmic differences would in principle be superior to percentages, because increases and decreases would then be nymmetrical. but since moat of the percentage changes here are small this is not an important consideration, and peroentages have the merit of familiarity. the mean absolute error is arithmetically simpler than the root mean equare error, and avoids the high weights aasigned to extreme errors that squaring implies. in practice, the mean absolute error is one of the most important such series of forecasts covers only the recent period of expansion. these are the forecasts prepared by the council of rco nomic advisers and published ench year beginning with january 1962 in the ecorzomic report of the president. the forecasts pertain to gross national product for the year ahead, in current and in constant prices, and the implicit price deflator, which is one of the broadest measures of the general price level. with respect to gnp in current prices the report has been explicit. the forecast has been stated as the midpoint in a range of plus or minus 5 billion dollars, which since 1962 has been roughly equivalent to plus or minus three fourths of one percent of gnp. the report has generally been less explicit with respect to the price level and real gxp, though when the numbers are not stated the approximate rates of change implied in the forecast can be inferred. one of the conditions implicitly and often explicitly underlying the forecasts is that the president’s budget and economic program will be enacted. hence the fore casts should, strictly speaking, be judged only after taking account of the extent to which these conditions were met. the record in table 3 does not, of course, do this. during four of the six years when the forecasts can be compared with actual changes, the rate of price increase was underestimated, a tendency par ticularly marked in 19g5 66, as i noted earlier. on the other hand, the forecasts somewhat overestimated the rate of growth in real gnp. as a result, the aver age forecast change in current dollar g n p over the period as a whole was almost exactly right. nevertheless, the errors in individual years were not inconsequential. for each of the three variables the errors, on the average, were roughly twenty to twenty five percent of the mean rate of change. in five years out of six the actual value of current dollar gnp fell outside the range within which it was considered likely to fall. a snore reasonable range in the light of experience would have been about twice as large, namely, plus or minus 1 1/2 percentage points, which is plus or minus 12 billion dollars at current levels of gnp. even this wider margin of error would have been exceeded in two of the six years. a common way of appraising a set of forecasts is to compare the results with what could have been achieved by some simple method of extrapolation. one such method is to assume that the change in the coming year will be the same as the change last year. the mean errors resulting from this procedure are shown in the table, and they exceed the mean forecast errors for current dollar and real gkp, but not for prices, where the simple extrapolation yields ap proximately the same results. there is reason to suppose that it should, since the report has often stated its expectation regarding prices in terms of extend highly correlated with the root menn square error. the correlation coefficient the mean absolute error. since a correlation between forecast and changes that is close to zero. on the other hand. a high positive relation does not in self represent good forecast performance if the mean error is iarge. the actual changes are baaed on the first official estimates aiven in the rcporl following the year for which the forecset wan made. changes in constant dollar gnp and in the price deflator are basod on estimaten in 1964 dollara for 1900 gl to 1964 65, and in 1958 dollara thereafter. this extrapolative method applied to annual data will, of course, always be a year late in recog nizing an acceleration in the rate of inflation, or in anything else. the gn1' forecasts in the president's economic report achieved a positive correlation with subsequent actual changes, which again is superior to the simple extrapolation of last year's change, since the latter was if anything inversely correlated with the actual change. but the correlation attained by the forecasts is modest. by this measure (that is, r2) the forecasts account for only a small fraction of the variance in actual rates of for gnp in current dollars and 23 percent for gkp in constant dollars. i turn next to some other forecasting records. the mean error of forecasting the annual rate of change in gross national product by various groups of economists, according to eight sets of records assembled by zarnowitz, is set forth in table 4. the records begin generally in 1952 or 1953 and extend through 1963 (more recent figures are available but have not yet been in corporated in summaries). piiost of these mean errors range between 1) and 2+ percentage points, and hence are consistently larger than those of the economic report. however, the period covered is different. the records in the errors involved in a simple extrapolation of the preceding year's rate of change were about twice as great, on the average, during 1952 63 as during 1961 67. relative to the variation with which the forecasters were faced, therefore, the forecasts in the economic report do not represent as good a performance aa that achieved by most of the forecasting groups in zarnowitz' sample. this is indicated more directly by the correlation coefficients, which range from 0.6 to 0.9 in table 4 compared with 0.3 in table 3. the collection of forecasts in table 4, therefore, though they made iarger errors, captured a substantially larger fraction of the variation in rates of change in gnp than did the forecasts in the economic report. unfortunately, we have not yet checked this result by a direct comparison covering the same period, which is necessary if the forecasting hazards are to be matched preci ely. another forecasting record, where such a check can be made, is shown in table 5. this pertains to forecasts of the annual rate of change in gnp in constant dollars rather than in current dollars, and is based on the econometric model originally formulated by lawrence klein and art,hur goldberger, and subsequently developed by daniel suits.'o the forecasts have been presented in november of each year at the conference on the business outrlook at the university of michigan.since the above wan written. results during 1961 67 for two of the groups (a and d) in table 4 have bwn compared with those of the ecanomic report. both groups tended to underestimate the rate of growth in current dollar gnp. the mean absolute errors were 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent for a and d respectively, and the correla tion coefficients between actual and forecast changes were 2 9 and 23. the poorer performance may be partly attributable to the fact that them forecasts antsdate those of the economw report by two or three months. 10 1 am indebted both to suits and to jon cunnyngham for information regarding the forecasts. the forecasts were producad not by a single model but by a system of equations that was altered in some respect almost every year. forecast percentage changes are computed from published reports of the michigan conference on the economic outlook and data supplied by the university of michigan research seminar in quantitative economics. uternative forecasts based upon diflerent data or policy aaeumptions are given in parentheses. for 196243 and 196354 we me the alternative corresponding to the policy adopted (the 1964 tax cut): for other years we ubb a simple average. actual percentage changes are based on the first official estimates given in the economic report of the presiden! for the year following the year for which the forecast was made. forecast and actual changes are based on estimates in 1939 prices for 1951 56, in 1947 prices for 1956 57, in 1954 prices for 1959 85. in 1957 prices for 1957 58, and in 1958 pricea for 1958 59 and 1965 68. during the past six years, 1961 67, the errors in the suits’ model forecasts were larger than those in the economic report in four years and smaller in two, with the mean error exactly the same. the model forecasts and the report forecasts were quite closely correlated with each other, though the correlation between forecast and actual change was somewhat smaller for the model than for the economic report. however, this difference cannot be given much weight because the sample period is short. in the earlier period, 195243, as well as in the period 1952 67 as a whole, the model forecasts were much more highly correlated with the actual changes than during the past six years, though the mean error was somewhat larger. both the higher correlation and the larger error may be due to the fact that the variability in rates of change in real gnp was substantially larger in the earlier period. in any event, in both the earlier period as well as more recently the model forecasts have been substantially better than those of a simple extrapolation of preceding year changes. for the fifteen year period as a whole, the model reduced the error of extrapolation by more than 50 percent, had a mean error of about 1$ percentage point,s, and correlation between forecast and actual rates of change in real gnp of 0.7. the record was marred espe cially by the forecast for 1954 55, which substantially underestimated the rate of expansion actually experienced. excluding this oiie year, the mean error would have been approximately one perceutage point and the correlation 0.9. although a direct comparison with the collection of forecasts in table 4 is not possible, since the latter refer to current dollar gnp, where somewhat larger errors might be expected because of the difficulty of forecasting prices, the model forecasts appear to stand up comparatively well."" i conclude that it is reasonable to expect, on the basis of past performance, that economic forecasts made near the end of the year for the year ahead will predict the percentage rate of change in gross national product with an error averaging about one and a half percentage points. one can expect, also, that the predicted rates of change will be positively, though far from perfectly, correlated with those that actually occur. in both respects this is a much better result than can be achieved by simply extrapolating last year's change in gross national product. i cannot undertake to examine the results of forecasting the magnitudes of change in gni' by quarters, to consider how forecasting errors increase with the span of the forecast or with the distance of the forecast interval from the present, or to review the available data for other variables. these are fascinating topics, full of iiistruction for the practitioner as well as the user of forecasts, but i pass them by in order to discuss standards of forecasting accuracy and ways to improve performance. iv the availability of a fairly systematic record of past forecasts of turning points and of magnitudes of change make it possible to formulate standards by u hich to judge future forecasts or forecasts derived by new methods. the record tells us what it is reasonable to expect, and what can be considered su perior performance. one of the great merits of such a standard is that it has a realistic, historical basis, not a hypothelicnl one. another is that it is not subject to the bias of hindsight. nevertheless, it does have several limitations. first, the past period may 11 this conclusion waa aleo reaohed by cunnjmgham 131 on the basin of a direct ooniparison of constant dollar and ourrent dollar gnp foreouab. not be comparable with a future period with respect to ease or difficulty of forecasting. although adjustments can be made for this, they cannot be en tirely adequate. a secoiid limitation is that the past forecasts are frequeutly conditional, and the conditions may or may not have heen met. a straightfor ward comparison with what happetied, as it1 our ilppr:lisal above, may either not do justice to the forecasts or may ircut them more favorably than they deserve, hut) in any caae does riot tell as much as we should like to imow about what standards to apply to coiiditiorial forecasts in the future. a related point is that as the timeliness, power, and appropriateness of governmental actions based upon forecasts improves, the forecasts themselves may be negated. and as forecasts become more widely publicized and more uniform witness the common phrase ""standard forecast"" the reactions of private firms and in dividuais may place the forecasts in jeopardy, or help to bring them about. a simple historical record of accuracy, then, may no longer provide an appro priate benchmark. e'inally, n standard based upon the past record may not provide a proper stimulus to improvement. we must seek to do better, not, merely to equal our past achievements. in this last respect, the standard provided by the past, record seems to be an improvement over the so called naive modrls or extrapolative methods. as we have seen, the record of niost forecasters is superior to at least one of the naive models the extrapolatioti of the most recent change. recent work by zartiowitz, nlincer, theil, cunnyngham, and others shows that this ""same change"" model is inferior to more sophisticated autoregressive models. but many sets of actual forecasts, at least for short periods ahead, beat even the best autoregressive models. in this sense the past record provides a higher standard, as well rs a more realistic one. recently i have been experimenting with a standard, based upon leading indicators, that incorporates some elements of the historical and some of the extrapolative, mid i should like to describe its properties briefly. first, a com posite index of leading indicators those that have generally reached their peaks atid troughs at an earlier date than business activity as a whole is constructed, using methods developed by julius shiskin [lo]. it is then assumed, as suggested by past evidence, that this index leads various specific measures of aggregate economic activity such as gross national product, industrial production, or employment by six months. this implies that the percentage change between jscal ?/ear nvrragcs of t hc leading index should be closely correlated with the percetitage change between the subsequent calendar year averages of the aggregates. it turns out that this basis the percentage changes in the leading index, appropriately adjusted by a simple regression, provide fairly accurate estimates of the turning points atid the percentage changes in calendar year data for gnp aiid otlirr aggregates if we could wait until just nftcr the middle of the calendar year to make our forecast for that year, by which time fiscal year averages for the leading index would be available, this method would, in the postwar period, have provided forecasts correlated with the annual percentage changes in gnp to the extent of about 0.8, with an average error of something less than l+ percentage points. unfortunately, forecasts must be made earlier than this. the simple device we have resorted to is to use whatever part of the current fiscal year figure for the leading index is available as an estimate for the entire fiscal year. for example, if only the initial quarter (july, august, and september) is available because the forecast is being made, say, in october, the change between that quarter and the preceding fiscal year average is used as an estimate of the change between the full fiscal years. since this in effect shortens the span over which the change is measured, and at the same time increases the assumed lead to some thing like months instead of 6, the regression adjustment needed to fore cast calendar year changes in gnp is different than before. the mean error on this basis for the postwar period is approximately 2 percentage points and the correlation coeecient is 0.6. as more data for the current fiscal year become available, they can be used to revise the forecast. in late january, for example, data for the first two quarters of the fiscal year could be used. we have calculated the forecasts for the postwar period on the alternative assumptions that one, two, three, or four quarters of data are used (this could also be done for successively larger groups of months instead of quarters, since the leading index is available monthly). the regression equations and summary measures of error are given in table 6, for gnp in current and in constant dollars. the table shows how the correla tion improves and the mean error is reduced as more recent data for the leading index are used in the forecast.l2 table 7 compares the actual forecasts referred to above with these results, making use of data on the leading index for only the initial quarter of the cur rent fiscal year, i.e., through september of the year preceding the one being forecast. for the most part, the forecasts of change in gnp based upon the leading index compare favorably in terms of magnitude of error and degree of correlation. the experiment suggests, therefore, that this mechanical use of the leading index can produce a standard of forecast accuracy which is not easy to surpass. such a standard has several points to recommend it, apart from its past the index of leading indicators used in tables 6 and 7 is based upon 18 leading indicators and is. virtually the same results can be obtained without the ‘trend adjustment.’ since these computations were completed the u.s. department of commerce has begun to publish a monthly index baaed upon 12 leading indicators (see the november 1968 issue of busirnss coditions digest). regression analysis based on the latter index yields results similar to those given h e the regreasion equations baeed on the index of 12 l d m g indicators. 1961 67, are as follows: independent variable: dependent variable: regreasion analysis is, in fact, not essential to the procedure. the method used in constructing the index can be adaptad m) that the index has the same trend and average cyclical amplitude 88 the aeries being forecast. further adjustment by means of regression is then superfluous, and may indeed b i i the forecaets. one is that it depends largely upon economic information from outside the series that is being predicted. the various naive models depend only upon the previous history of the forecast series, and usually only its very recent history. the outside information that the leading index contains is of a kind that can be expected, on a variety of theoretical grounds, to bear upon future changes in aggregate economic activity. new orders for equipment and con tracts for construction have obvious anticipatory elements. other leading indicators are connected with future activity by more complicated routes, ranging from those that explain why changes in the average workweek ordi narily precede those in employment or output to those that explain the delayed reaction of the economy to a change in the rate of growth of the money supply. moreover, extensive empirical testing, carried out over many years, lies behind the selection of the individual leading indicators. although no amount of theorizing or empirical testing can insure that past relationships will persist, it is only by these means that we build confidence in particular forecasting procedures. the empirical evidence examined in selecting the leading indicators per tained primarily to the consistency of their timing in the business cycle. the corresponding calculations for the leading inder. and the regressions as well. are based on the latest revised gnp estimates. using the equations in table 6. lines 1 and 5 (fitted to data for 1951 67, based upon changes in the leading index from the precedini fiscal yeir to the third quarter). an alternntive set of forecasts for 1961 67, based upon reereseion equatione fitted to data for the prior period 1949 01, yields the following results for 1961 67: mean absolute correlation ermr (75) coefficient gnp in current dollars 0.7 64 gnp in constant dollam i 0.9 1 95 degree of correlation between the magnitude of their movements and those of g s p or any other aggregate was not considered. l 3 this means, then, that the correlations recorded in tables 6 and 7 are not just reproducing a relationship used in selectins the leading indicators. to this extent, the results do not depend on hindsight. aloreover, although liistorical evidence with respect to the leads or lags of the indicators at turning poirits in the business cycle was a vital factor in their selection, much of this evidence goes back to the period before world war 11. indeed, about a third of the 1s indicators included in the index were originally selected in 1950 011 the basis of prewar evidence, and a postwar u note, however. that it has baan known for eome yearn that the magnitude of change in various indicators during the early is correlated with the severity of the itself (of. 171). index constructed from the 1950 list is not unlike the present index. hence, we may have some confidence that the average timing assumed in the method will persist, despite considerable variability at particular turns in the business cycle. in many respects the method is analagous to the reduced form of a system of econometric equations. tho reduced form weights or coeficients are applied to the predetermined or exo,genous variables the system to allow for their direct or iridircct etrects on order to generate a forecast. in the leading index weights are applied to various leading iiidicators to allow for differences in their amplitude of variation amid other factors, and as a final step, a regression coefficient is applied to the weighted average change in the indicators to a forecast. the choice of variablcs is different and so is the procedure for deriving weights, but in the end both forms obtain a forecast by applying a reasonable system of weights to a set of variables believed to be related to thc future course of csp. the procedure i have oulliiicd for generating annual forecasts is easily kept up to date, and readily applied to such series as gross national product, industrid production, employment or unemployment for states or for countries that are not endowed with comprehensive economic data and the analytical models that require such data, the method might prove useful. it can be used for shorter time units than a year, say, quarters of half years. by modifying the assumption regarding a six month lead, and perhaps with other modifications in composition or weightitig, it might be applied to variables that lag in the business cycle, such as some price indexes or some interest rates. but it must be emphasized that the consistency of fore casts of different variables generated from a sin& leading index needs to be carefully checked. forecasts of current, and in constant, dollars may or may not imply a reasonahle forecast of the price deflator; forecasts of output and of employment may or may not imply a reasonable forecast of produc tivity; aiid forecasts of employment and of unemployment may or may not imply a reasonable forecast of the labor force. in short, a simple arid mechanical met hod cannot be expected to pass all the complex tests one can set for it. it is not a substitute for a carefully reasoned approach to the economic outlook, whether this approach takes the shape of an econometric model or of a less formal apparatus. all that the method does is help to summarize the information contained in a group of leading indicators regarding the near term future course of gnp or other variables that are systematically related to the business cycle. hence it can provide the forecaster with some of the information useful in developing his actual forecast, and it, can be used as a standard by which to judge his past efforts, perhaps helping him to improve upon them. v forecasting is the activity of the economic statistician that is most visible to the public. the public is not likely to forget the dramatic failures, like those i mentioned at the outset. but these apparent failures require careful analysis. sometimes the sequel alters one’s view. the demise of the harvard abc curves after 1929, which i referred to earlier, is a case in point. did the historical sequence upon which the scheme was based disappear in 1929 never to return? was it a mere figment of a harvard professor’s imagination? the answer is no. stock price indexes have continued to lead at business cycle turns as sys tematically since 1929 as they did before; various types of interest rates, though not all, have continued to lag; and the rise of interest rates and tight ening of money during an expansion of business has been one of the factors tending, after a time, to curtail new commitments to invest, shift investor’s sentiment from stocks to bonds, cause stock prices to turn down, and bring the business expansion to an end. the harvard curves oversimplified the situation it was not as simple as abg but they did contain a kernel of t8ruth about the way our economic system works. one lesson i draw from my review is that the development of the science of forecasting depends crucially upon the accumulation and continuing analysis of a record of forecasts. without a record one cannot evaluate the performance or tell how to improve upon it. all too often forecasts are thrown out and forgotten or thrown out with the hope that they will be forgotten as soon as the occasion for them is past. they are often inadequately annotated when they are made. they often fail to specify what the present level of activity is believed to be, what assumptions or conditions are laid down, what probability or range of outcomes is attached to the forecast under these conditions, what is expected to happen if the conditions do not obtain, and what method or information was used to arrive at the results. sometimes, even, the forecasts are couched in terms that make them unverifiable. since forecasts are always subject to revision as more information becomes available, a record of the re visions, the reasons for them, and their relation to the final outcome is an im portant part of the story. econometric model forecasts, in principle, meet many if not all of these conditions. but econometric model builders are as human as the rest, as any attempt to resurrect an ex ante record of model forecasts will show. to judge from experience, it is too much to expect the individual forecaster to develop a scientific record of his work on his own initiative. the benefits that may accrue to him are uncertain the record may even prove to be fatal! and he always has plenty of other things to do. the benefits really accrue to the profession, and sooner or later to society as a whole. in view of this, i believe the statistical association, and particularly its business and economics statistics section, has a significant role to play. for a number of years the b&e section has conducted an annual outlook survey among its 5,000 members. questionnaires are mailed out and the replies tabulated. last year about 400 members responded and perhaps half of them indicated that they regularly prepared forecasts. it seems to me that this sur vey could be developed so that it would become the vehicle for a scientific record of economic forecasts, and hence be of far greater service both to the profession and to the public. if it is to be this, the survey should be conducted quarterly, and thereby provide an opportunity to record the frequent revisions that forecasters make. it should provide for the identification, though not the disclosure, of the name of the forecaster, so that a continuing series for each respondent can be accum ulated. it should specify, or allow the forecaster to specify, what are the most recent levels or rates of change in relevant series. it should record the assumptions attached to the forecast, allow for probabilistic or alternative forecasts, and call for a description of the methodology. the questionnaire that was circulated in the july 1968 survey went some way to meet these specifications. careful consideration must be given, of course, to how far one can go and still retain the cooperation of respondents. moreover, to be useful the results must be analyzed and compared with sub sequent developments, and provision for this on a continuing basis must be made. the analytical work should be closely tied to the survey itself, so that the needs and ideas of the analysts can be reflected in the questions asked."" a systematic, analytical record of forecasts and a continuing review of the results is one step toward better forecasting procedures and results. other steps must be taken as well. improvement in the quality of the basic data is fundamental. a recent study [l] of the revisions in the provisional gnp esti mates, upon which all forecasters depend, showed that about forty percent of the mean error in forecasts was attributable to errors in the current data. two fifths is a substantial fraction, and it represents a part of the forecasting error for which forecasters per se cannot be blamed. on the other hand, the agencies constructing the provisional estimates cannot be blamed either, for the fault lies with the inadequacy of the information they must use to produce estimates promptly. a considerable improvement in the accuracy of forecasts could be brought about by a massive effort to bring the less adequate types of data up to the level of the best. better coverage of output, wages, and prices in the service industries; greater attention to obtaining transaction prices, both domestic and international, in contrast to list prices or unit values; prompter reporting of information on profits ; reduction in erratic elements in anticipatory statistics such as housing starts, new orders, and construction contracts; classi fication of data on new orders by industry placing the order; and far more com prehensive statistics on job vacancies than are presently available these are among the items that should be on our statistical agenda. their development will not only improve analyses of general economic prospects but will also contribute to more enlightened public policy and private decisions at all levels. finally, we need to expand the scientific studies that inform us about how our economic system works, and what have been the effects of policies and institutions upon its workings. this is not the place to consider systematically the types of analytical studies most needed to support short term forecasting efforts, but i should like to mention a few relatively neglected types of study. one is a careful review or set of case studies of past forecasting failures to ex plain what went wrong, how far it was avoidable, and what lessons for future forecasting can be learned from such episodes. a second need is for studies devoted to the forecasting of leading indicators. their anticipatory value would clearly be enhanced if we could forecast their own movements; yet with few exceptions little work of this kind has been done. in this connection a promising line of attack is to examine the behavior of various types of lagging indicators. historically the behavior of many leading indicators, such as new orders or profit margins, appears to have been strongly influenced by the opposite movements of certain lagging indicators, such as interest rates or unit labor costs, particularly when the relation of the latter to the level of aggregate activity is taken into account. a third type of study demanding attention concerns the relations between the problems of forecasting short term fluctua tions and those of forecasting intermediate or long term growth trends. one of the first requirements is the compilation and analysis of a record of longer term forecasts. a great deal of such forecasting is done, it has a considerable influ ence upon investment and other decisions, and yet we know very little about, its accuracy and what contributes to sound results. all of these paths to progress better records of forecasting, a sounder sta tistical base, and a more enlightened economic framework are costly. but the potential benefits to society are great. the nation is devoting large re sources to economic forecasting. tardiness or failure to identify, measure, and anticipate the forces of inflation or of recession can affect the welfare of millions. economic forecasters have, in my judgment, demonstrated an ability to forecast. but there is much room for improvement, the limitations need to become better known and more firmly established, and the most dependable techniques developed, demonstrated, and adopted. the statistical profession itself should take the leadership in bringing this about.

Ross Eckler","1940-1969","statistical data have become increasingly important with the past 20 years showing rapid growth in several areas, particularly in the production of general purpose statistics. despite these advances, the author contends that statisticians have largely failed to apply their skills to measuring demand for, and supply of, statistical data. recommendations are offered for reducing this neglect and encouraging a new comprehensive treatment of the subject. the allusion in the title of this talk is not intended to refer either to the level of skill represented by the two occupations or to the degree of their progress toward obsolescence. it may in fact be unfair to shoemakers, who for all i know may actually be most solicitous about their wives' footwear. but there is no doubt in my mind that statisticians, for all their emphasis upon the art of measurement, have largely failed to apply their skills to measuring demand and supply for their own product statistical data. the neglect can not be excused on the ground that there has been a generally static situation which would offer little incentive and limited opportunity for measuring changes. on the contrary, the past twenty years exhibit rapid growth in a number of areas of central importance to most of us. 1. some indicators of growth we have available a number of different indications of growth. the number of members in our association has increased from a little over 4,000 in 1950 to over 10,000 currently. the sales of electronic data processing systems have increased from $47 million in 1955 to more than $2 billion in 1967. although the data for the two years are not fully comparable and many of the systems may not be used for statistical work, the dramatic nature of the increase is abundantly clear. federal statistical budgets, which were about $30 million in 1945, have currently expanded to about five times that level. another measure of growth is the increase in the number of courses in statistics and in the number of recipients of ph.d. degrees in statistics. there were seven such ph.d's in 1945 and 73 in the latest year. the foregoing are quantitative indications of sharp expansion in available resources in recent years. equally dramatic increases have taken place in the technology of producing statistics and in the systematic use of statistics. we know, for example, that sharp gains in productivity have been made possible by the development of new equipment and by the advances in statistical techniques. we know also that state and local governments have an increasing number of legislative provisions which tie local administration directly to statistical data on population size and other characteristics. the kind of local government, the number of representatives on councils and boards, the granting of licenses, and the allocation of funds are all related directly to statistical measurements. even more important are the rapidly growing uses of statistical data by the federal government, and by many kinds of business. in other words, we have a situation in which both demand and supply have risen sharply. any effort to calibrate this rise, however, runs into obstacles. we lack a unit of measurement. we have only limited knowledge of the expanding uses of statistics and we are without any systematic evidence of gains in productivity and the sources of those gains. by this time i hope i have made part of my case for the coupling of statisticians and shoemakers. to pursue an examination of the supply and demand aspects within the time limits imposed by both tradition and preference, it is necessary to be quite selective. i have decided therefore to focus attention upon general purpose statistical data such as measures of economic activity, population characteristics, and the like. in the first place, the provision of, or utilization of, such data is of direct concern to a very considerable proportion of our membership. second, on the basis of the statistical budgets of the federal government alone, many millions of dollars each year are appropriated for provision of general purpose statistics. finally, in this area, recent changes in both supply and demand have been particularly notable. 2. changes in the supply (or production) side of statistics on this basis, let us turn first to the production side of general purpose statistical data where there have been some outstanding advances in recent years. the importance of this aspect of our work was brought to my attention several years ago by ingvar ohlsson, director general of the national central bureau of statistics of sweden. the following is a quotation from a document on “long term programmes for organization and management of the swedish central bureau of statistics.” “perhaps an even more important observation is that the production of statistics is in itself an important instrument of rationalization in society. the scope, direction, and quality of statistics are of great significance for the functioning of society and looking at the production of statistics by the bureau particularly for the possibilities open to the community to carry on effective planning and policies.” if we start our examination of the production side by limiting our attention to a specific statistical program, we can set up as a criterion of performance the amount of statistical information per unit of cost. unfortunately, this statement, like many others which statisticians make from time to time, sounds more definitive than it really is. first of all, a meaningful measure of the amount of information is required, since obviously we are not interested in the maximum number of cells of data regardless of reliability and usefulness. one solution is to identify a particular key measure such as the estimate of a particular magnitude or ratio (e.g., total retail sales) for which a tolerable level of statistical error can be set. on this basis, the producers of general purpose statistics have been able to utilize a great variety of advanced techniques which optimize their output in terms of cost. some of these gains can be illustrated under the headings of sample and re sponse error control, collection, processing of returns prior to tabulation, con duct of tabulations, and dissemination of results. truly impressive gains in statistical output are directly attributable to the development of the scientific approach to the design of samples. the use of multi stage stratified samples, clustering, varied rotation patterns, and the use of collateral data in the estimating process have served to decrease unit costs very significantly, to spread the reporting burden more equitably, and yet to take full account of administrative feasibility as determined by field operating considerations. research into the measurement and control of errors of response has resulted in very significant changes in decennial census procedures which will be reflected in part in improvements of quality and in part in lower costs. but despite these gains, much remains to be done in developing a theoretical basis for optimizing the control of sampling and non sampling errors for a fixed level of cost. the most dramatic changes in this area have been in (1) the development of procedures for utilizing available administrative records, without face to face questioning or mail inquiry and (2) the increase in the use of the mails rather than direct canvassing by enumerators. in many large governmental programs the mail procedure has been facilitated by the existence of comprehensive mail ing lists, maintained for administrative purposes, and by modern electronic equipment with the ability to check in responses so rapidly that follow ups for delinquents can be on an almost strictly up to date basis. the use of computerized, custom tailored collection forms sent back and forth on a shuttle basis has been a further factor in reducing cost of collection, improving quality of returns, and lowering processing costs. spectacular gains in this area are attributable to electronic data processing equipment and peripheral facilities. one of the important gains has been the use of mark sensing or electronic scanning of marks to transfer information on schedules or microfilm copies into machine readable form without the need for hand punching of cards or paper tapes. in the canadian and u. s. censuses, considerable savings in time and cost have been made possible by this type of development. another major advance has been the use of computers to perform many of the tasks formerly carried out by clerks. computers are able to apply a large number of complex criteria to determine when a return is unacceptable and when missing data can be properly imputed. when units have the same weight (such as population) the imputation can be made simply by selection systematically from a subgroup of units with a prescribed set of similar characteristics. in other universes, such as business establishments, the best imputation may be based upon a comparison of the relationships among several reported items, such payroll, cost of materials, and value of shipments. these relationships provide tolerance limits for reported items relative to “expected values” and for imputing values as necessary because of unacceptability or omission. when a particular ratio for an establishment is out of tolerance relative to other establishments, examination of a series of different ratios for that establishment will show whether the numerator or denominator is most likely to be in error. through trial and error procedures, it is possible to determine the adjustment which is most likely to be correct. in some types of editing the use of year to year changes is a powerful tool for the analysis of the current returns. a by product of the application of the computer to tasks of imputation is a count of the number of cases for which such action is taken. the user of statistics thus has a definite measure of the extent to which data have been supplied or modified by the edit and review process. computers also greatly reduce the burden of coding. for example, if the re turn for a unit includes street and number information, it is possible to code this mechanically to a predetermined statistical subdivision such as a block, traffic zone, or census tract. tremendous advances have been effected by the use of electronic data processing in tabulation as well as pretabulation processing. for example, in connection with tabulations of population or housing statistics, the computation of analytical ratios aids tremendously in identifying areas for which returns are incomplete or subject to some other difficulties. because of the speed of electronic equipment and its ability to store vast amounts of information, detailed cross tabulations can be carried out which would not be feasible by the use of conventional equipment. more complex weighting and estimation procedures also are now feasible and can often significantly improve the reliability of sam ple results. studies of components of a particular series are relatively simple and measurements of changes over time become more feasible. likewise, the analysis of, and detailed inter comparisons among, complex ratios open up new opportunities for analysts. indeed, it seems probable that analysts have just begun to realize the extent to which they have been freed from the limitations imposed by previously available means of tabulation. in view of this freedom, new techniques of data analysis are likely to result, with material benefit to our knowledge of economic structures and processes. thanks once more to the new tabulation systems, we can refer to dissemination of results rather than to publication. if we choose to put out results in conventional published form, the high speed printer and a new device for photo typesetting by a cathode ray tube approach represent much progress in reducing time and cost for producing printed output. with the great increase and availability of edp equipment, an alternative that has great advantage to many users because of speed and flexibility is the provision of information in machine readable form (e.g., magnetic tape). one further extension in the service of computers is the preparation of brief textual information to accompany tables. thus far, this approach has been used primarily in highly repetitive situations such as the preparation of individual census releases for each of 3,000 counties. it may be possible to extend the capabilities of modern electronic systems to prepare press releases in cases where speedy output and uniformity of approach are particularly important. a recent official directive of the u. s. government places great emphasis upon the prompt availability of statistical information. the easiest way to introduce uniformity of treatment in these releases may be through a computer generated review of the tabular materials. such a review will call for identification of the most important elements of change and will apply to those changes a uniform terminology rather than one which may reflect the points of view of many different analysts. the use of such computer generated releases may seem to imply a routine approach, but they can in some respects be more objective and informative than those prepared by analysts working under time limitations. although they will never compare with human exposition at its best, such computer generated releases will offer speedier in formation at lower cost and less variability of interpretation. it is reasonable to conclude from the description of some of the advances in recent years that statisticians have achieved a record of cost reduction which may well compare favorably with the better documented achievements of industry. despite the rapid rate of progress already described, it seems highly likely that electronic data processing systems will make possible much greater gains with the development of more powerful central processing units and more flexible software systems. advances in character recognition systems will facilitate input of large bodies of administrative data that have thus far re quired costly manual conversion into machine readable form. it is not too much to expect the eventual development of flexible statistical systems geared to operate directly as policy and decision aids. certain other advances seem likely in the years ahead. with modern tools, it is possible to hold down duplication in the collection of original data by improved utilization of available records at all levels of the government. the possibilities of highly developed statistical data retrieval systems are only beginning to be realized and the potentialities are very great, thanks to the growing numbers of users equipped to use tapes. it may prove possible to create local data centers providing access to summary tapes on a very flexible basis. through the use of computers, statistical publications can include more and more derived figures, arrays by size, and graphic materials, all of which will greatly increase their usefulness and reduce the burden otherwise borne by widely scattered users. one might expect that the production of general purpose statistical data, an area which has included many significant technological developments and promises to have a good many more, would have attracted much attention in the literature, in training programs, and in text books. on the contrary, training, documentation, and discussion have been quite limited. relatively little training is offered to statisticians who wish to work primarily on the collection, processing, and tabulating of data. moreover, the amount of attention which has been given to quality control, validation, and evaluation of output in this area has been modest, indeed. in the industrial field, by contrast, a separate and very active professional group is concerned with maintaining and assuring control of quality. the lack of attention on the part of most statisticians may be due to long standing views about the routine nature of statistical operations or to more obvious challenges elsewhere. it is explained in part by the fact that this subject is of major concern only to survey statisticians. the absence of interest in data handling as a discipline in its own right is reflected in the typical decentralization of production operations even in large agencies where the advantage of specialization would be the greatest. in the u. s. census bureau all data processing operations have been centralized. steps in the same direction have been taken in the u. s. bureau of labor statistics and are currently under way in great britain. the prevailing pattern, however, even among large agencies, is to have operations decentralized and in effect subordinated to subject matter considerations. one gain from increased attention to the characteristics of statistical data systems would be a better understanding of some of the features that distinguish them from accounting systems. in many of these statistical systems, we seek to optimize the aggregates and derived summary measures and are not concerned with the consistency of each individual record. those who undertake to use micro records without understanding the characteristics of the system which produced them are likely to be surprised and may be led into unjustified criticism of the producers. the cost of direct collection account for a heavy proportion of the total cost of a statistical program, often representing from one half to three fifths of the total. collection costs have risen relative to other statistical costs, both because of the difficulty of finding canvassers and because of changes in population characteristics, such as more 1 person households and more 2 person families with both members in the labor force. these costs rise especially sharply when efforts are made to improve coverage and reduce nonresponse. closely related to this problem are the costs borne by the suppliers of the data. while the public is generally ready to cooperate, the attitudes of some respondents can change significantly in response to publicity regarding possible future hazards of misuse of the data they are asked to supply. all these considerations emphasize the importance of the fullest possible exploitation of sources that can be used as an alternative to direct collection. for government agencies this means that maximum use should be made of administrative records where suitable arrangements are possible. respondents are especially likely to object to supplying data which they believe are already available in other government sources. on the other hand, the task of collating individual data from several different sources is surprisingly difficult in the present state of the art, and substantial efforts must be put into coordinating and standardizing administrative records before the potential savings in using these sources can be realized. even in the case of a single statistical series we have no effective operations research model to tell us how to direct our improvement efforts to gain a maximum reduction in cost. the variety of options becomes much greater for an organization concerned with a number of statistical series, based upon information from a variety of respondents supplemented perhaps by information from one or more sets of administrative records. to deal with the alternatives, we would wish for a series of production functions each indicating the changes in output to be expected with each assumption regarding input. it would then be possible theoretically to program the production function in such a way as to achieve maximum gains taking into account all phases of the operation. we now turn to consideration of the problem of measuring the use of, and demand for, general purpose statistical data. this has not been completely neglected, but attempts at quantitative measurement have been sporadic and the results have not been very conclusive. some attention was given this matter at a session of the international statistical institute at sydney in september 1967, when representatives of five countries participated in a program entitled “appraising the demands for and utilization of official statistics.” the program revealed a strong interest in this subject in countries with different economic systems (canada, czecho slovakia, india, sweden, and the united states). there was a consensus that the problems of measuring demand are essentially similar regardless of the type of economic system and that much more work needs to be done. in the paper prepared for this session by tore dalenius of the university of stockholm there was a bibliography which included 181 entries. the great bulk of the references are to general statements regarding statistical programs and the uses they serve, and to appraisals of statistical programs. in our country three separate government agencies the office of education, the national center for health statistics, and the bureau of the census have reported on efforts in the last several years to measure uses but apparently none has provided a basis for program planning. the work done in the census bureau was summarized in a paper by hansen and voight for the 1967 meeting of the inter national statistical institute mentioned above. there have also been many re views of the uses of various economic statistics in hearings conducted by the joint economic committee of the u. s. congress. the president’s economic report transmitted early in 1968 called particular attention to the need for accurate and timely statistical data to guide policy positions. there are a number of reasons for failure thus far to quantify the value of uses or the extent of needs for statistical data. first of all, the identification and listing of users are not easy tasks. the difficulty of tracing end use is accentuated by the fact that many elements of economic and social statistics are taken into the public domain through re publication so that it is difficult to trace all the uses that are made of a particular body of statistical information. even when the use can be traced and clearly identified, it is difficult to deter mine just how much bearing a particular item of information had upon an individual decision. a further complication arises because of the possibility that one figure may serve as a proxy for another so that the importance of either on0 is difficult to assess. moreover, the usual market place determination of value is not applicable in this situation. in the case of general purpose statistics, the uses are spread over so many agencies and institutions that no single user could be expected to pay the full cost. an obvious exception to this situation is to be found when a tabulation or a survey is contracted for solely to meet a particular use. because we are unable to measure value of data on a particular subject, we are likewise unable to determine the relative importance of the various goals served by different kinds of general purpose statistics. to use the federal statistical program as an example, what basis can we find for assigning proper priorities to data for short term analyses (inventory changes, new orders) , data for long term growth studies (measurement of wealth) and data for evaluating progress on social programs (such as would be provided by a series of social indicators)? under each program priority, in turn, decisions are required regarding the relative importance of a number of objectives, such as timeliness, geographic detail, amount of subject classification, and reliability of results. the allocation of limited resources so as to best satisfy such a set of demands is not likely to be reduced to a purely mathematical problem, even if we knew how to set prices on end products. in the absence of such ability, dependence is now placed primarily upon personal and collective judgments as supplied by committees and various experts familiar with individual statistical series. the problem of measurement is even more complex in relation to newly emerging demands of some government programs for interrelating data from a number of government agencies. interest also is increasing in the measurement of changes for identical units over a period of time. this creates matching problems of significant difficulty. the use of numerical identification, such as social security numbers, as an aid to matching records has thus far met with considerable public resistance. there is a demand also for the measurement of somewhat elusive characteristics of parts of the population, such as degree of alienation. for these undertakings, whole batteries of new and somewhat un usual questions may be required to provide a basis for scaling, and the public finds it difficult to understand the needs for the questions considered one at a time. clearly, there exists the danger that the confusion and suspicion en gendered by such inquiries may lead to damage in other survey areas. one specialized form of demand is in connection with legal cases. with grow ing sophistication in the applications of statistical data there has developed an increasing willingness on the part of the courts to accept sample estimates. a requisite for such use, however, is full documentation of the statistical data used for evidence, including a full statement about sampling and nonsampling error. in a recent article pointed out that an evaluation of the statistical system must not limit itself to uses being made of available statistics but must in addition include those needs which are inadequately or not at all satisfied. despite the great expansion and demands for statistical data in recent years, there are reasons to think that requests may be sharply escalated in coming years. the situation is essentially the same in great britain as we may judge from the following quotation from the may 1968 issue of statistical news: “government statisticians thus face a quite unprecedented demand for their wares, and also possess equally unprecedented technical tools for producing them.” in the united states, demands for a series of social indicators and the possible preparation of an annual report on social changes will provide the basis for many additions to, and improvements in, existing statistical systems. as a consequence of the growth of local planning efforts we are encountering requirements for urban and regional information systems of very considerable magnitude. the effort to provide current data for very small areas involves serious difficulties unless local administrative records can be utilized to perform tasks not now being carried out. it should not be assumed, however, that the demand for more statistical information is universal. on the contrary, there are some people, including legislators, who feel that there are already too many figures available. they want less intervention by government, especially the federal government, and fear that statistical data may provide the basis for more social and economic legislation. nevertheless, it seems safe to forecast an ever increasing demand for current information for individual areas as a basis for decision making. at this point i rest my case for stating that statisticians have followed the example of the traditional shoemaker in matters that should be of closest con cern to them. despite abundant evidence of very great and widespread gains in the production of general purpose statistics, there is lacking any new comprehensive treatment of this subject. one of my friends who has been particularly interested in this matter, ingvar ohlsson, has identified as the latest book on this subject, melhoclik der vollczahlungen by p. heiss, which was published at jena in 1931. i am indebted to him also for a modest list of titles of articles and occasional papers dealing with this subject. there is a similar lack of literature on the demand side even though we have a much longer list of titles from tore dalenius. notwithstanding the extraordinary growth in the applications of statistical data to government uses, at all levels, as well as to business needs, there have been only sporadic efforts to measure uses and to provide bases for determining priorities among various general purpose statistics. the problem was well expressed in a recent brief submitted by the dominion bureau of statistics to the special committee on science policy of the senate of canada in which the following statement appeared: “the process is not necessarily rendered easier by the fact that, in almost all cases brought to dbs attention, benefits appear to exceed costs by a comfortable margin. the difficulty is, of course, that there are not enough resources to do all the good things, and the problem is one of ranking, in order to make the best choices out of many good choices.” thanks to the improvements in efficiency on the production side, some of the cost of neglect of the quantification of supply and demand has not been clearly apparent and indeed may not be serious. however, our inability to quantify our output to measure gains in productivity, and to provide an adequate base for cost benefit analysis, warrants considerable criticism, particularly from some managerial and technical people outside of our own profession. the competition for resources is an increasing one, a contest in which statistical work in business, government, and elsewhere must be set off against similar requirements for many other kinds of work. those who must make the choices seek measures of output and its value and relation of costs to benefits as a basis for their decisions. our continued failure to supply such measures can be mis construed as due to a lack of enterprise or to a desire to hide the facts. in lieu of direct measures, statisticians have sometimes resorted to proxy measures to indicate the importance of their work. the relating of statistical expenditures to gross national product, total sales, amount of capital investment, and the like usually shows extremely small percentages, but it fails to convince anyone but ourselves that proposed expenditures for statistics are therefore conservative and justified. it is equally unsatisfactory to allocate statistical efforts in terms of the cyclical behavior of various segments of the economy. continuing dependence upon judgment as a basis for priorities is justified only if all efforts have been made to provide objective standards. i come now to one of the most predictable parts of a talk like this: the making of recommendations. i shall be considerably less specific, however, than some of my predecessors who called for concrete actions such as appointments of committees or professional support for definite program changes. first, i would recommend that we give more attention to the secondary or indirect costs of collecting statistics, that is, the cost which is borne by respondents. among the claims made in support of legislative proposals concerning the 1970 census has been the charge that the interests of the public which sup plies statistical data have not been considered. the psychological costs involved in reports by individuals are always difficult to assess. some people, for example, have real concern about the possible misuse of the information which they provide, despite the confidentiality provisions of long established law. the civil liberties union, after a careful review of the mandatory requirements of the decennial census, came to the conclusion that the mandatory provisions should be imposed with the exception of one question where the problem of definition is believed to be serious enough to make it undesirable to compel a return. the fact that many would disagree with their exception does not alter the fact that, in this area of measuring costs, statisticians have de pended almost entirely upon judgment and have done little or nothing to provide any evidence, either through studies or through attempts at direct measurement. in the case of collection of data from establishments the problem of psychological cost is ordinarily not present, but the burden on the responding organization may be substantial. the status of the records and the accounting systems may greatly affect the ability of an establishment to furnish either the exact data requested or reasonable estimates. second, i would recommend much more consideration of problems involved whenever we have a pooling or matching of two or more sets of records. it is clear that the conduct of these operations can easily lead to misinterpretation by the public; hence, there is a need for broad public education on these matters prior to the initiation of such an operation. in every case the purposes must be clearly defined and the gains must be clear and unequivocal, and not available through other procedures. finally, there must be a clear cut and understandable mechanism to assure that the merging or combining of records does not pave the way for future detriment to particular individuals. third, there is need for much more dissemination of information concerning the characteristics of micro records and summary records which can be made available for use under appropriate restrictions consistent with conditions under which the data were collected and processed. the lack of such information in the hands of users can result in much wasted effort and in disappointments based upon erroneous understanding of the data input. fourth, i believe that statisticians from a variety of disciplines should join in helping develop a systematic body of knowledge regarding the production of statistics. these efforts would and should take a number of forms. through training programs and seminars we should be able to achieve a broader dissemination of techniques among producers and potential producers. the case system of training seems especially promising in demonstrating the application of new techniques. the census bureau has been able to make effective use of this system in the training of foreign nationals, and it is to be hoped that the joint efforts of our association and other professional groups may yield improved methods of disseminating knowledge of production technology. in this connection, we should make systematic and continuing efforts to develop papers, seminar discussions, and perhaps eventually texts on statistical production technology. the annual programs of our association and of the chapters could do much to give greater emphasis to production technology and could eventually provide the basis for rationalizing decisions regarding the utilization of resources applied to statistical undertaking. a number of possible benefits from such discussions may be mentioned briefly even though some of them deserve much more than brief mention. for example, as noted in the report on long term programmes of the swedish central bureau of statistics, wider use of work measurement in statistical operations might be achieved. more agencies might examine the case for centralizing their operations, a shift that thus far has not been at all extensive. although much has been done in measuring the levels of error in censuses and surveys caused by nonsampling errors, there is still much more work to be carried out before we shall have a theoretical basis for optimizing the control of such errors for a fixed level of cost. the benefits of interchange can be especially great in such developing areas as computer mapping, character recognition, and storage and retrieval techniques. my fifth recommendation has to do with broadening the uses of administrative records. since these are developed for the implementation of particular legislation relating to taxation, to social programs, etc., there is a strong tendency to hold down the use of questions not absolutely essential to the purpose of the law being administered. although the administrators of such programs are becoming increasingly alert to the statistical value of their records, they are likely to err on the conservative side in considering a proposal for an added inquiry that is needed only by statistical agencies. i recommend that the coordinating statistical office of the central government be given the right to review all administrative forms in order to assure full recognition of the needs of statistical agencies. this is a matter which, in the united states, should receive the attention of a national statistical com mission if such an organization is set up following the formal recommendations recently made by our association. my sixth recommendation is based upon the fact that official statisticians in this country and abroad have responsibility for a large amount of work in the field of general purpose statistics. it is upon them, therefore, that we particularly depend for encouragement and progress. my sixth recommendation is perhaps not within the framework of the responsibility of the statistical association, even though our membership includes a number of key government statisticians of other countries. at any rate, i recommend that a mechanism be developed for promoting international exchange of advances in production techniques. the central statistical office of sweden under the direction of ingvar ohlsson has already moved to make its journal one which is devoted largely to the field of production. at the present time, cooperative arrangements exist among the scandinavian countries and there have been various bilateral exchanges between the united states and other statistical offices, but there is no real mechanism for insuring that techniques developed in one country are brought to the attention of others. perhaps the international statistical institute, which is seeking to broaden and revise its role, might find an opportunity here that would engage the interests of some of the countries well represented in the institute and would contribute much to progress in the developing countries. my seventh recommendation has to do with undertaking a much more penetrating and thorough examination of uses than anything thus far attempted. to avoid the danger of efforts that may be interpreted as self serving, an independent review, possibly with foundation support, should be sought. the difficulties are great, t.he costs would be heavy, and a substantial amount of time would be required, but public attitudes toward statistics are sufficiently skeptical to require that we attempt to provide better answers than we have found thus far to justify the burden and costs of statistical undertakings. as a part of the study of uses, an intensified educational program is needed to inform suppliers of the importance of the data they furnish. most of the individual complaints about the population census for 1970 have come from persons completely unaware of benefits accruing to them directly and indirectly through cooperation in this national inventory. my eighth and final recommendation is that we should try to get better evidence than we have provided thus far in answer to those skeptics who find it hard to believe us when we say that cost benefit analysis cannot be used as a guide to decisions relating to statistical programs. again to quote the domin ion bureau of statistics report to the senate of canada: “ideally, the statistical program should be established by comparing costs and expected benefits of each element in the total program, the existing as well as new components, and then ranking the elements in the order of net benefit. this principle is easy enough to expound but there are intractable problem involved in its implementation.” much of what i have covered tonight has concerned the difficulties faced by statisticians as they try to rationalize their program decisions. the difficulties can be well documented and the pabh is a long one, but in the words of an old chinese proverb, “a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.”

activities and heterogeneous member ship. however, the fact that the association is broad based undoubtedly accounts for its strength (over 70,000 members) and endurance (established in 1839). the multiple faceted aspect of the association should be considered an important asset resulting in the opportunity for healthy injections of differing kinds of people and ideas. the author contends that, even in the face of dislocations and accelerated change in many areos of modern life, the membership has the leadership qualities to make any needed adjustments and continue the development of the association as a viable and vigorous organization, provided we cooperate with mutual respect and tolerance, despite our differences, and continually remold ourselves, subsequent to such adjustments, as a diversified but single scientific and educational community. 1. introduction for a group of individuals to constitute a true community, the individuals must have something basic in common despite possible differences among and within subgroups. it is natural that the ‘something basic in common,’ for the membership of this association, be a serious interest in the discipline of statistics. however, there are several different definitions of statistics. possibly a working consensus definition, subject to continuous modification through time, may be worth considering. it is apparent that any such consensus definition of statistics must be basic and non specialized in nature. among others, four possible candidates are: encyclopedia britannica (1969). as commonly under stood nowadays statistics is a mathematical discipline concerned with the study of masses of numerical data of any kind. a dictionary of statistical terms (1960), m. g ken dall and w. r. buckland. the science of collecting, analyzing and interpreting numerical data relating to an aggregate of individuals. encyclopedia a (1968). as a name of a field of study, statistics refers to the science and art of obtain ing and analyzing quantitative data in order to make sound inferences in the face of uncertainty. international encyclopedia of the social sciences, “statistics the field” by william kruskal (1968). statistics is concerned with the inferential process, in particular, with the planning and analysis of experiments and surveys, with the nature of observational errors and source9 of variability that obscure underlying patterns, and with the efficient summarizing of sets of data. * t. a. bancroft is director of the statistical laboratory and head of the department of statistics at iowa state university. this article is the presidential address delivered at the 130th annual meeting of the statistical association, december 28, 1970. detroit, michigan. actually these definitions are all concerned with the question: how to make sense of data? however, the field of statistics shares this concern with all empirical sciences. on the other hand, this facet of statistics, if acceptable as one important aspect of a possible working consensus definition, differentiates statistics from pure mathematics considered only as an axiomatic deductive system. the britannica definition adds to the numerical data aspects the identification of statistics as a mathematical discipline or, more specifically, one of the mathematical sciences. the kendall buckland definition adds the notion of an aggregate of individuals or presumably a parent population or probability distribution. this facet of statistics, if acceptable, would appear to characterize it as being a somewhat more specialized mathematical science than general applied mathematics, since the latter is more concerned, although not exclusively, with deterministic models. the a definition adds to the data aspect the notion of making uncertain inferences. this aspect of the latter definition, in my opinion, is of vital importance since it explicitly identifies statistics as a part of the scientific method, that is, a primary methodology for obtaining new quantitative knowledge in several empirical sciences. in view of this, it seems to me that statistical inference, from both the applied and theoretical points of view, should be considered the heart of the discipline of statistics. we should encourage more of our bright young statisticians to specialize in statistical inference. before i am found out and possibly accused of bias, i will admit to having written the a definition in 1952. the definition given in the international encyclopedia of the social sciences also emphasizes the inferential aspect of statistics. in addition, it attempts to describe statistics in terms of some of the important activities engaged in by statisticians when acting as statisticians. it may be worth noting the first sentence of the article which contains the statement: “a scientist confronted with empirical observations goes from them to some sort of inference, decision, or conclusion.“ question 1.1 : is a working consensus definition of statistics, subject to continuous modification through time, necessary and/or desirable to assist in maintaining the association as a single but diversified scientific and educational community? question 1.2: is our discipline simply concerned with a collection of loosely related techniques which have been found useful in investigations in various substantive fields? question 1.3: is our discipline simply a branch of applied mathematics, or is it concerned with something much deeper, such as the meaning of quantitative knowledge and the methodology of obtaining such knowledge in certain kinds of problems in the empirical sciences? 2.1 the dual nature of the discipline of statistics those parts of statistics which stem from mathematical probability and all uses of other fields of mathematics in developing statistical theory and methodology must, of course, meet the usual requirements for rigor as regards proofs in mathematics itself. in making this statement, one must be aware that, as far as the foundations of mathematics itself are concerned, there are different schools of mathematicians, e.g., the intuitionist, the formalist, and the logicist. as a simple example, it is customary for standard texts on mathematical statistics to introduce probability theory based on set theory of the logicist school of mathematics. considering statistics from this point of view alone, one might well conclude that statistics is only a branch of mathematics. however there is, in my opinion, another important and broader scientific aspect of statistics : its additional role as part of scientific methodology. results obtained in applying mathematical or theoretical statistics must meet the requirements for validity in the empirical sciences. quoting from carl g. hempel [2] : “in empirical science, which includes both the natural and social sciences, the grounds for the acceptance of a theory consist in the agreement of predictions based on the theory with experimental evidence obtained either by experiment or by systematic observation.’ such ‘theories’ in the empirical sciences are actually working theories and subject to change as additional data become available, in particular, by means of more precise measuring devices and/or improved experimental procedures or by deeper insights often made possible by earlier scientific research. considering mathematics from, say, the logicist point of view, one counter example is enough to make a pro posed theorem unacceptable. while that part of mathematical statistics which is analogous to mathematics in this sense should be considered similarly, it would seem that a different attitude is called for in considering the differing statistical inference theories such as the neyman pearson theory, decision theory, bayesian theory, etc. in particular, if a specific inference theory ‘works’ well in the above empirical sciences sense for certain kinds of prob lems, let’s use it, even though we may find that it will not ‘work’ at all for certain other kinds of problems or will not ‘work’ for thew latter problems as well as some other statistical inference theory. in adopting the above statistical inference philosophy, we are considering a particular statistical inference theory as one possible working theory among several possible working theories. a choice of a particular statistical inference theory for a particular empirical problem in hand then will depend on the prior information available and how well the particular inference theory assumptions are realized. finally, any numerical result obtained would be valid only insofar as it meets the validity requirements of empirical science. in case of doubt, one may wish to try out several statistical inference theories on the same set of empirical data. the above pragmatic inference theory philosophy, which permits the investigative situation to determine the particular inference theory finally used, would appear to be the only tenable approach for a statistical society concerned with applications as well as theory. this does not mean to say that certain members of such a society should not specialize in some aspects of mathematical statistics, or in theoretical research in some particular inference theory, or in developing a new inference theory, or in studies on the foundations of statistical inference. in recognizing the dual nature of statistics, however, it is important that we recognize the limitations of both certain of the empirical sciences and pure mathematics. heisenberg’s uncertainty principle [l ] implies that there are essential limits to our ability to know and predict certain physical states of affairs. as has been suggested by at least one worker in the philosophy of science, shideler [4] : “the effect of observation the fact that the observer becomes a part of the system he is examining is at least a part of the significance of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle l1 again, goedel [3] has shown that mathematics, considered as axiomatic theory, is incomplete. he proved, in effect, that if a is an axiomatization of the ordinary arithmetic (e.g., peano’s arithmetic), then if a is consistent, there exists a statement of a that neither it nor its negation is provable in a furthermore, he showed, that if a is consistent, then the consistency of a is not provable in a , except by appealing to principles transcending those of a whose consistency is as questionable as that of a possibly the following quotation from a paper by john von neumann [ 5 ] may be appropriate here: “as a mathematical discipline travels far from its empiri cal source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from ‘reality,’ it is beset with very grave dangers. it becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more z’art pour z’art. this need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well developed taste. but there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the lines of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. in other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much ‘abstract’ inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. at the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. “in any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the reinjection of more or less directly empirical ideas. i am convinced that this was a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and vitality of the subject and that this will remain equally true in the future. question 2.1.1 : should the association take additional steps in promoting even more effective communication and interaction between mathematical and applied statisticians? question 2.1.2: should the association take additional steps in promoting even more effective communication and interaction between statisticians and empirical scientists? question 2.1 3: should the association encourage additional research including expository articles on the foundations of statistical inference, including the meaning of quantitative knowledge? 2.2 statistics and science in general in its important role, that is, the relation of statistics to empirical science, it may be worthwhile to repeat a quotation from a paper i had published in the statistician exactly ten years ago. “the situation in statistics, i believe, is analogous to that suggested for science in general by alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america: ‘the mind, it appears to me, may divide science into three parts. ‘the first comprises the most theoretical principles and those more abstract notions whose application is either un known or very remote. ‘the second is composed of those general truths that still belong to pure theory, but lead nevertheless by a straight and short road to practical results. ‘methods of application and means of execution make up the third. ‘each of these different portions of science may be separately cultivated, although reason and experience prove that no one of them can prosper long if it is absolutely cut off from the other two.’,, if the analogy is a valid one, then these three parts, in the case of statistics, form a whole, and in this respect statistics constitutes a single scientific and educational community. it follows that the statistical association, which includes in its membership those who must be concerned directly or indirectly with all three parts, meets these criteria as a diversified but single scientific and educational community. subgroups of the association’s membership may be actively engaged in cultivating only one and/or two of the three parts, but indirectly, at least, each part will eventually be affected by developments in the other parts. individuals who specialize in “the most theoretical principles and those more abstract notions whose ap plication is either unknown or very remote” may wish to consider the institute of mathematical statistics or some society in probability as a primary home. however, such should find a desirable second home in the 9 statistical association, since it is well known that relevant and non trivial abstract theory problems in mathematical statistics and probability are often suggested by difficulties that arise in applying known but not completely adequate statistical theory to research in the empirical sciences. certainly professional and/or academic statisticians, in whatever fields their university degrees may happen to be, who specialize either in theory close to applications and/or methods of application and means of execution will find a primary home in the association. again, many substantive area specialists and administrators, such as economists, business executives, research directors, government officials, university professors who have not specialized directly in statistics, and others, will find at least a second home in the association. in particular, will this be true of persons in these subgroups who have primary interest in the methodology of obtaining new scientific knowledge, in addition to interest in the concepts, facts, and theories of some one substantive discipline or enterprise. question 2.2.1 : should the association take additional steps to promote more tolerance and respect among statisticians specialized in the respective three parts of statistics identified above? question 2.2.2: in view of recent publicity given to the supposedly overproduction of ph.d.’s in certain scientific areas, should the association attempt to provide current information and future estimates, possibly in the american statistician, on the demand for statisticians at the b.s., m.s., as well as the ph.d. levels? question 2.2.3: should the information on the current demand and future estimates for statisticians be reported by different categories, e.g., by: (a) interest in abstract theory, (b) theory close to applications, and (c) methods of applications and means of execution? question 2.2.4: should the over 100 statistics degree programs currently offered by universities and colleges take into account the current and future estimates of the demand for statisticians in the three categories mentioned in the previous question, when considering the total number and kinds of statisticians being trained? question 2.2.5: in case there should be an estimate of an oversupply for the immediate future of ph.d.’s specialized in the more abstract theoretical aspects of statistics, is it likely that departments of statistics should concentrate more resources on the training of terminal b.s. and m.s. candidates and on the production of a greater proportion of ph.d.’s or joint ph.d.’s in theory close to applications and methods of application and means of execution? 3.1 the pluralistic nature of the association membership the heterogeneous composition and diverse interest of the membership of the association is well recognized and documented in the following statement found on the first page of the journal: 10 jc “the statistical association is a scientific and educational organization. its membership is not confined to professional statisticians but includes economists, business executives, research directors, government officials, university professors and others who are seriously interested in the application of statistical methods to practical problems, in the development of more useful methods, and in the improvement of basic data. engineers, mathematicians, biologists, actuaries, sociologists, psychologists, and representatives of many other professions are included in the membership of the association. to serve the diverse and specialized statistical interest of its heterogeneous membership the association, as you know, is subdivided into the five more or less homogeneous sections : biometrics, business and economic statistics, physical and engineering sciences, social statistics, and training. more recently there has been organized the biopharmaceutical subsection of the biometrics section and the subsection on statistics in marketing of the business and economic statistics section. a continuing committee on computers in statistics has been assigned the important responsibility of meeting the needs of the association in the area of statistical computing, including the arranging for sessions and joint sessions in statistical computing at annual and regional meetings of the association and national and regional meetings on the interface of statistics and computer science. this year an informal subgroup on “teaching of statistics in the medical sciences” is petitioning for recognition as a subsection of the section on training. question s l l : since statistical computing is inter sectional in nature and hence not a logical candidate for initiation on a subsection basis, should not the association recognize the great importance of the use of computers in statistics by organizing a section on statistical computing ? question 3.1 2: is there a need for the association to encourage departments of statistics to offer degrees in statistical computing and/or joint degrees in this area with possible departments of computer science on the same campus in addition, of course, to degrees in statistics per se? question 3.1 3: should the association stimulate more cooperation and interaction among its sections by en couraging its program committees to arrange even more jointly sponsored sessions, panel discussions, and invited talks on relevant topics of mutual interest? 3.2 subclassification by broad types of employment possibly useful insights may result from considering the three broad areas of employment of most members of the association: business and industry, government, and educational institutions. activities of the statistical agencies of the three sectors are obviously interrelated and interdependent. data on individual business and industrial activities are made available to the relevant government statistical agency. in turn, the government agencies make available aggregate statistical series aa well general statistical information obtained from population censuses, various special purpose surveys, etc., for information and research by business and industry and educational institutions. finally, departments in educational institutions are responsible for the training of academic and professional statisticians and statistically oriented subject matter specialists for employment in educational institutions, business and industry, and government. the individual student, making a choice to major in a particular academic department of statistics, has been one determinant of how many specialists and what kind of academic and professional statisticians will be produced. however, we must not overlook the influence of the professors, in particular, the major professors who direct graduate theses. paraphrasing and adapting a comment made regarding the training of medical doctors by c. m. cobb in 1970: the educational system’s models are professors who impart not only knowledge and, for the graduate students, direction of research but ethics, attitudes and values. if, as is usually the case, these distinguished men are specialists or sub specialists in some area of theoretical research, it is not strange that their value system is imparted to their students. if promotion, peer approval, and prestige in academic statistics come only from research and publication in statistics per se and not from competence in teaching or in applying statistics in research in empirical science, it is only natural that the student be drawn into theoretical statistical re search and the “publish or perish” syndrome. fortunately, more and more academic departments of statistics are providing broad undergraduate and graduate degree programs. these programs include theory courses close to applications, such as courses in design and analysis of experiments and design and analysis of sample surveys, courses in general applied and theoretical statistics, and relevant supporting courses in mathematics. some statistics departments are providing statistical consulting and cooperative research experiences and related training for their graduate majors. also, several departments of statistics are providing service courses where needed at the undergraduate and graduate level in substantive field oriented courses as : econometric statistics, time series, psychological statistics and psychometrics, sociometrics, industrial and engineering statistics, bio logical statistics including plant science and animal science statistics, genetic statistics, educational statistics, etc. again, several statistics departments offer strong minors in statistics for graduate students majoring in various scientific areas. a few offer joint ph.d. programs between statistics and mathematics of an abstract mathematical nature and/or between statistics and some scientific area which admits a thesis problem involving a sophisticated application of known statistical theory and methodology to a substantive area problem and/or the modification of some existing statistical theory and methodology to such an investigation. there are a few departments of experimental statistics or applied statistics. it would seem appropriate that a ph.d. thesis problem in statistics per se should involve a contribution to statistics as a mathematical science in its own right. while engaging in such an undertaking, a graduate student in statistics should acquire considerable insight into and appreciation for creativity involved in expanding the research frontiers in statistics itself. however, unless the student demonstrates considerable talent in such re search, he will probably find a position after graduation in an educational institution, business and industry, or government which will not involve a considerable amount of time devoted to research in developing new theory and methodology in statistics per se. in view of the above, it is not too likely that we will have an oversupply of statisticians at the ph.d. level at least in the short run, provided the majority of our doctoral programs are broad based and involve training of a more applied nature, including training and experience in statistica1 consulting and cooperative research, in addition to courses in statistical theory and supporting courses in mathematics. in this connection it will be increasingly important in the future for graduate programs in statistics to prepare new ph.d.’s in attitude as well as training for some of the types of employment which are most likely to be open to them. quoting from page 3 of the report of the survey committee, conference board of the mathematical sciences, volume 111, 1970: (‘ students must not be educated with ‘false’ aspirations for solely research careers (in the mathematical sciences per se).” question 3.2.1 : should the association encourage universities with well established broad graduate programs in the mathematical sciences (mathematics, statistics, and computer science), in addition to continuing their more specialized separate degree programs, to establish joint r4.s. and ph.d. degree programs, especially adapted to the broader mathematical sciences training needed by those students who expect future employment in four year colleges, junior colleges, community colleges, and secondary schools? question 8.2.2 : should the association encourage de partments of statistics to establish more joint graduate programs between statistics and some substantive area science? question 3.23 : should the association encourage departments of statistics to provide more service courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels for students majoring in various substantive area departments? question 3.24: since it is important that service courses of a more applied nature and training and experience in statistical consulting and cooperative research be closely related to specific substantive fields, should departments of statistics arrange more joint faculty appointments with other departments? 4.1 current and future outward and inward directed cooperative activities it is well known that the association has established relations involving joint arrangements with other american scientific and educational communities which have been in effect for several years. these include the holding 1 1 of joint annual, regional and local meetings. in particular, this year’s annual meeting is being held, as you know, with the biometric society (enar and wnar) and the economic association and other allied societies. again, in my opinion, a classic example of a co operative undertaking in the area of journal publication is that of the joint efforts of the asa community and the society for quality control community in sponsoring technometrics. this publication serves admirably the interface and complementary interest of both of these scientific and educational communities. further, the association holds joint meetings with the institute of mathematical statistics and cooperates with the institute of mathematical statistics and the biometric society (enar and wnar) on matters of mutual interest through the committee of presidents of statistics societies (copss), e.g., the nsf visiting lecturer program in statistics. as an example of a more routine but important cooperative arrangement, the asa central ofice makes the arrangements for a combined membership directory including lists of members of asa, the ims and enar wnar, and provides other services to the two biometric society regions in north america. some of us will remember that the association provided a large share of the leadership needed for holding the 1947 meeting of the international institute of statistics in washington, d. c. at the 1969 london meeting of the isi, the incumbent asa president, a. ross eckler, ex tended an official invitation, which was accepted, to hold the 1971 meeting of is1 again in washington. an asa steering committee and the asa central office is providing a large share of the work required to make the necessary arrangements for this meeting of an international community of government statisticians and many other statisticians with diverse interests. it is my understanding that the arrangement expenses will be obtained from private grants and registration fees. the association’s central office and certain chapters for several years have encouraged and helped arrange seminars and short courses to upgrade and/or update the statistical competence of statisticians and statistically oriented subject matter specialists in business and industry and federal, state and local government agencies. the association has assisted the educational institutions in the recruitment of students to take undergraduate major and service courses in statistics by publishing the brochure on “careers in statistics” and by encouraging the work of the joint committee of asa and the national council of teachers of mathematics to develop needed teaching materials in statistics and probability, at the high school level, under the able chairmanship of the former association president, fred mosteller. the additional work of mosteller and his associates in undertaking to publish a series of books, at various levels of technical sophistication including an expository account for the general public, providing examples of the power of apply ing sound statistical methods to real data, is indeed commendable and should do much to provide insight into the kind of work engaged in by many members of the association. the association has encouraged university summer institutes in statistics for college and secondary teachers of mathematics and science. during the 1968 term of office of former president geoffrey h. moore, a recommendation was made by the association that a presidential commission on federal statistical programs be appointed to make a thorough study of such programs. as most of you now know, president richard m. nixon approved the recommendation and announced on august 12, 1970 the appointment of the commission with w. allen wallis as chairman, frederick mosteller as vice chairman, and daniel b. rathbun as executive director of the commission staff. the 14 members of the commission include recognized experts in the field of economic and social statistics as well as individuals from business, labor, and the law. since the last appraisal of federal statistical programs was made more than 20 years ago as part of the study of the hoover commission, the members of the association feel that a new review is needed to maintain the quality and adequacy of statistical information as a basis for planning and decision making processes at the national level. early in 1970 the board of directors of the association approved a proposal to conduct a study of future goals of the statistical association. as a consequence, an overall steering committee was established with william h. shaw as chairman and several task forces appointed to concentrate on problems of primary importance to the future of the association. these task forces include the following: meetings task force, special projects task force, standards task force, structure task force, and finances task force. it should be noted that, instead of establishing new special committees, the board of directors of the association with its representative membership and in keeping with its constitutional function is conducting the study itself on future goals. it is also worth noting that it was the consensus of opinion of the board and council that, in times of rapid change such as we are now experiencing, ‘future goals’ will mean short run future goals, say, those that hopefully may be attained within the next three to five years. in all of these outward and inward directed activities, the association calls on the diversified talents of its heterogeneous membership. in my opinion, these activities are strengthening and will further strengthen the association as a single scientific and educational community. 4.2 concluding remarks i have posed several questions tonight for possible future consideration by the association. some of these and many others are being studied by the new committee on future goals. any action taken will, of course, be determined by the members of the association and their elected representatives. one of the great strengths of the association is its heterogeneity. in particular, with the recent interest of federal agencies in supporting in house and contract interdisciplinary projects on societal problems, it should be expected that the diverse talents of the members of the association will be of even greater importance in answer ing the inevitable question of how to make sense of data. the association must continue to offer a home for statisticians and a second home for statistically oriented substantive area specialists with diverse interests and provide an opportunity for healthy interaction of differing kinds of people and ideas. i believe the membership has the leadership qualities to make any needed adjustments and continue the development of the association as a viable and vigorous organization, even in the face of dislocations and accelerated change in many areas of modern life. if we cooperate with mutual respect and tolerance despite our differences and continually remold ourselves subsequent to needed changes, the statistical association will endure as a diversified but single scientific and educational

Shaw","1970-1999","this address describes certain paradoxes and problems as they affect statistics singular, statistics plural and statistics political. it summarizes recent progress toward resolving the problems but stresses the need for major additional effort if statistics is. or are, to remain truly meaningful and viable. 1. introduction asa presidential addresses tend to be of two kinds: descriptions of research and reports on issues related to important areas of statistics or to association aims. in recent years presidents moore and eisenhart gave notable reviews of research, presidents eckler and bancroft cogent reviews of issues. my address deals with issues. it reflects a background in economic research, in the federal government and in business, a background the common statistical element of which has been the use of economic data. from this element comes what some may regard as a prejudice. i view statistics as a crutch, indispensable, but still a crutch. a crutch cannot walk by itself no matter how well built. moreover, if it is not proportioned to the needs of the user, it can hinder as well as help. within the limitations of this prejudice, i propose to discuss a few paradoxes, problems and indications of progress as they affect statisticians individually and collectively. the indications of progress will be confined to recent examples; but i need hardly note that our profession has a long and distinguished record of progress. 2. three definitions at least some of the paradoxes and problems stem from the existence of three distinct definitions of statistics. as described in a popular dictionary [lj these are: 1. ""the mathematics of the collection, organization and interpretation of numerical data .. used with a singular verb."" 2. ""a collection of numerical data .. used with a plural verb."" 3. ""political science dealing with state affairs."" in his modest, but rewarding elementary text l.h.c. tippett puts the third definition more elegantly than the dictionary. he notes that ""the use of statistics in the business of running the country through its political, commercial and social institutions in those * william h. shaw is ...istant to the treasurer, e. i. du pont de nemours & company, wilmington, delaware 19898. this article is the presidential address delivered at the 132nd annual meeting of the statistical association. august, 15 1972, montreal, canada. 7 activities that determine the health, wealth and happiness of mankind is the oldest and the most considerable use"" [8, p. 117]. as a kind of convenient shorthand, i will from here on refer to the three definitions as statistics singular, statistics plural, and statistics political, using political in its broad sense, not in its partisan sense. statistics singular may be thought of as concerned mainly with means, statistics plural with ends as well as means, and statistics political primarily with ends. admittedly, this shorthand is an oversimplification but it does help to point up the confusion, even conflict, that emerges from the different definitions. 2.1 statistics singular i start with a few observations on statistics singular ""the mathematics of the collection, organization and interpretation of numerical data"" in short, methodology. as with statistics plural, which i will discuss a little later, there is a major paradox which is also a major problem. on the one hand, there is a tendency to imply, if not to state directly, that good methodology is a sufficient end in itself, or more extremely, to imply that statistics singular is the only true definition of statistics. on the other, there is the sad fact that readily available good methodology is as much honored in the breach as in the observance or, probably worse, is often abused in the observance. the tendency to assert that good methodology is sufficient unto itself is understandable. there are few disciplines that over a span of some forty years have moved from a mere handful of colleges and universities in the united states and canada offering one or more degrees in statistics to a september 1971 count of 152. further, there are few disciplines that can point to as dramatic advances as are evident from even a superficial inspection of our professional journals over the same 40 years. notwithstanding such advances, the president's commission on federal statistics had the following comment on measurement of error an area of methodology notable for its sophistication: .. our systematic inquiry suggests that many (federal) agencies, including some of the major statistical agencies, have only the crudest understanding of the nature and degree of error in their output. agencies concerned with policies of great weight and moment have given us reports on the error structure of the series used every week by the congress and the executive branch. some of these reports consist of little more than vacuous assurances that comparisons are made with earlier periods, or that they carefully study the returns they receive [4]. the commission also noted that ""the quality of the statistics from (federal) operating agencies is not, except in a few instances, adequate. the inadequacies result in part from the neglect of the modern body of methods and principles which is known as statistics "" [4]. from my own experience, the neglect of modern methods and principles is at least as great outside the federal sector as within. in fact, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that federal agencies shine in comparison with most of their counterparts in the state and local and private sectors. resolving the paradox of the availability of good methodology and the problem of the all too frequent failure to use it is a major challenge. the report of the president's commission contains a variety of helpful suggestions, but in the last analysis resolution would seem to depend on how well individually and as an association we can convince producers and users of statistics that good methodology is essential to good quality. we must, however, beware of overkill. inappropriate or indiscriminate use can do as much, if not more, harm as lack of use. econometrics, for example, is a deservedly honored application of mathematical and statistical methods to economic analysis. yet indiscriminate application has been attacked by a highly respected economist. in his 1969 presidential address to the economic association professor wassily leontief noted that: in no other field of empirical inquiry has so massive and sophisticated a statistical machinery been used with such indifferent results. nevertheless, theorists continue to turn out model after model and mathematical statisticians to devise complicated procedures one after another. most of these are relegated to the stockpile without any practical application or after only a perfunctory demonstration exercise.... continued preoccupation with imaginary, hypothetical, rather than with observable reality has gradually led to a distortion of the informal valuation scale.... devising a new statistical procedure, however tenuous, that makes it possible to squeeze out one more unknown parameter from a given set of data, is judged a greater scientific achievement than the successful search for additional information that would permit us to measure the magnitude of the same parameter in a less ingenious but more reliable way. this despite the fact that in all too many instances sophisticated statistical analysis is performed on a set of data whose exact meaning and validity are unknown to the author or rather so well known to him that at the very end he warns the reader not to take the material conclusions of the entire ""exercise"" seriously [5, p. 3]. this kind of complaint about overkill is not limited to applications of sophisticated techniques to economic analysis. rather, it reflects a widespread and apparently increasing imbalance between improvements in data (statistics plural) and improvements in methodology (statistics singular). improvements in the one have outrun improvements in the other. and the indiscriminate application of sophisticated techniques to inadequate data can only raise disturbing questions about the role of statisticians as they move from methodology to application. i say as they move rather than if they move because, in my judgment, methodology without application is too narrow a foundation for our profession or for an association which purports to represent all parts of that profession. this is not to denigrate methodology. for just as theory is the lifeblood of the applied sciences, methodology is the lifeblood of applied statistics. even so, i find it encouraging that the chairman of columbia university's department of mathematical statistics recently stated that he is trying to nudge the department a bit toward applications and to restructure some of its courses to emphasize their relevance in the physical and social sciences. encouraging also, are t.a. bancroft's comments in the april 1972 statistician [3, pp. 14 6]. 2.2 statistics plural what should be the role of statisticians in application? there is no easy answer to this question but a look at some of the paradoxes and problems of statistics plural and statistics political may provide clues. we can begin with an elementary paradox and problem. at one and the same time there are two widely divergent but commonly held views of statistics plural. the two views have been well summarized by w.j. reichmann in ""the use and abuse of statistics."" one view is that published statistics are themselves invested with some quality of meaning not unlike the qualities ascribed to numbers by the pythagoreans, and that they enjoy such a degree of infallibility that they may be accepted without question.... the other and yet more popular belief (is) that statistics can be made to prove anything and therefore, by implication, that in fact they can prove nothing [6, pp. 9, 10]. both views would appear to reflect inadequacies in the public understanding of statistics however defined, a problem which is, or should be, of concern to all asa members. i am especially pleased to note that for the past several years your board and council have sponsored highly meritorious activity in this area by way of a joint committee with the national council of teachers of mathematics. the committee (chaired by frederick mosteller) is responsible for the publication of what promises to be a breakthrough in improving the lay understanding of statistics. titled, statistics a guide to the unknown, it is a collection of 44 original essays relating important applications of statistics to a variety of society's vital problem areas in an entirely nontechnical way [7]. an equally important product of the committee statistics by example, a volume designed for use in secondary education is in press. 2.3 statistics political relating applications to problem areas is, of course, the essence of good statistics political. and using both statistics singular and statistics plural effectively to help resolve vital social and economic issues is the quintessence. yet here, too, there is paradox and problem. for example, dependence on economic statistics to help shape federal economic policies has come to be taken for granted. increasing use of such statistics, however, seems to be accompanied by increasing misuse. the epidemic prevalence of five cultural diseases s currentitis, minisculitis, instantitis, moreitis and seleetivitis s makes this all too clear. these diseases can be especially virulent when they involve statistics. the first three currentitis, minisculitis and instantitis c have at least one common symptom, a debilitating weakness of perspective that results in feverish and often ill considered reaction. currentitis, as it affects economic statistics, for example, is characterized by exaggerated attention to the pleasing or unpleasing aspects of the behavior of the newest figure in such series as unemployment and prices, minisculitis by a hypersensitive need to find significance in small movements in data whether or not they are statistically or otherwise significant, and instantitis by a compulsive appetite for instant data, instant analysis and instant response. although no complete cure has been developed for any of the three, they can be kept under some degree of control by greater use of significance bands and other measures of reliability and by repeated forced feedings of perspective. but effective control requires more than greater use of existing statistical techniques for measuring error. improved techniques are also needed i techniques that do a better job of measuring the reliability of series not developed from sampling and techniques that do a better job of measuring sequential reliability over time. there is an even more pressing need for what may be called extra statistical significance techniques, i.e., for ways of getting at the problem of determining what levels or groupings of statistically significant changes in data should trigger consideration of policy or program change. difficult as this last concept is, i would hope that our methodologists could meet the challenge of translating it into statistical terms. moreitis and selectivitis have a much longer history than currentitis, minisculitis and instantitis, which are mainly a product of our times. moraitis, however, has multiplied since the coming of age of the computer. it is characterized by a simplistic tendency to equate more with better. in extreme form, moreitis substitutes massive and sometimes irrelevant detail for pertinent analytical statistics. in effect, it can be a kind of snow job that buries the user and thus the proper use of statistics. as with currentitis, minisculitis and instantitis there is no complete cure, but i would hope that our recently formed statistical computing section will help to curb, if not to contain, its spread. selectivitis, the fifth of these statistical diseases can be obvious, subtle or even unwitting. it is persistent, it is insidious and it encourages the deadly ""statistics can be 9 made to prove anything, therefore, prove nothing"" syndrome. two examples may help to show its nature. the first, a case of simple selectivitis, is taken from a column by art buchwald titled ""it's good news,"" and published in the washington post, september 16, 1971 : there was good news out of washington last week, according to attorney general john mitchell, president nixon's war on crime has been successful, and the results of the administration's monumental efforts have been so great that ""fear is being swept from the streets of some though not all cities."" .. the reason for the euphoria in the justice department is that fbi statistics for the 1970 indicated that the rate of increase of crime has gone down from 12 percent in 1969 to 11.3 percent in 1970. this sounded terrific, until i read that the same statistics revealed that :366,700 more crimes had been committed in 1970 than in 1969. admittedly confused, i sought out my friend professor heinrich applebaum, the great justice department statistician, whose definitive book do decimal points have a sex life? is used in every math class in the country. ""professor applebaum, the justice department reports that the rate of crime has gone down in the country under president nixon. yet the same report says there has been a million more crimes in the past two two years. how can that be?"" ""it's quite simple,"" said applebaum. ""percentagewise crime has gone down, crimewise it's gone up."" ""but where does that leave the average person?"" ""it depends whether you're a republican or a democrat. if you're a republican you have nothing to fear walking the streets of our cities. but if i were a democrat, i'd stay home."" ""are you saying that the republicans are trying to take the crime issue out of the 1972 campaign?"" ""they have,"" applebaum said. ""the last year the democrats were in office crime had gone up 13.8 percent. when the republicans took over in 1969 it only went up 12.0 and last year 11.3 percent. the democrats can't argue with that."" ""but still more people were robbed, mugged, murdered, and raped in 1969 and 1970 than they were in the previous four years."" ""we're not talking about people,"" applebaum said irritated. ""we're talking about percentages. you can't think about the people who were molested in 1969 and 1970, you have to think about the ones who weren't. there are probably over 100,000 citizens who weren't mugged this year thanks to president nixon's leadership."" ""it's hard to think in those terms,"" i admitted. ""that's because you're not running for election next year. you must understand the reporting of crimes is a very serious business, and can cause great conflict. j. edgar hoover, in order to prove he is doing his job, has to show that crime is going up in the country. at the same time the administration has to prove that crime is going down. ""the attorney general has solved the problem by reporting the percentages, which are lower, and hoover, by reporting the crimes, which are higher. that's the beauty of statistics. it makes everyone feel better.'"" yes, that's the beauty of statistics s but the funny bone can also be a painful nerve. like many of buchwald's columns, ""it's good news"" seems to be attuned to an existing widely held conviction in this instance the conviction noted by reichmann that statistics can be made to prove anything and, therefore, prove nothing. my second example of selectivitis is somewhat more subtle and, in a way, more serious if only because it involves respected professionals. it is taken from anew york times clipping datelined washington, december 19, 1971 and headlined ""doubt is cast on heralded sign of negroes' economic progress."" the clipping reads in part: a much heralded indication of black economic progress in the nineteen sixties was thrown into doubt by a special census bureau report released today. the indication is the bureau's earlier finding that northern blacks [sic] couples under age 3;) have essentially equaled the average income of their white counterparts. but the new study disclosed that this finding was meaningful only for black families in which both the husbands and wives worked. among those in which only the husband worked, there was, relative to whites, no gain between 1959 and 1970. the original finding of income equality was prominently cited by daniel patrick moynihan in his controversial 1970 'benign neglect' memorandum to president nixon. mr. moynihan, then a white house counselor, cited the finding as evidence of 'extraordinary progress'. the new report, undertaken in response to criticism of the original finding, confirmed the showing of income equality for the young northern black families. their average income jumped to 96 percent from 78 percent of comparable white family income in the decade, the report showed. but the new report, for the first time offering greater detail, showed this finding to be incomplete. census officials said: the income average for the young northern black families is enlarged because a greater proportion of their wives worked and worked more.... (than did white wives). the new report immediately stimulated two differing interpretations. ""these findings demonstrate that the whole idea of income equality is illusory. obviously, if whites sent their wives to work at the same rate, their average income would jump way ahead of blacks,"" said andrew hacker, professor of government at queens college, in a telephone interview. on the other hand mr. moynihan, now a professor of education at harvard, made a distinction, in a telephone interview, between two questions: ""one is how much families are earning. the findings i reported to the president have help [sicj up. these families have achieved income parity and that's an extraordinary achievement. ""as to the other question how the income is obtained we weren't told anything about these figures then."" although the closing remark attributed to dr. moynihan is not uncommon on the part of users, it seems to put the cart before the horse. users, especially professional users, do after all have a responsibility not only for asking the right questions, but also for knowing enough about their areas of statistics plural to relate the limitations of the data available for analysis to the questions. 3. our responsibilities tagging the user with sole responsibility, however, in effect saying caveat emptor begs the issue for practitioners of statistics singular and statistics plural. they, too, have responsibility: responsibility for insisting on quality, responsibility for curbing misuse, responsibility for adequate description and for stressing limitations, and perhaps most important, responsibility for helping to make statistics political a respected tool for analyzing and resolving problems, not just a numbers game. some highly desirable goals for all statisticians are set forth in the statistical association's own report, ""the study of future goals,"" as well as more recently in the ""report of the president's commission on federal statistics."" i commend both the commission report and the asa study as deserving reading and rereading. in fact, the basic theme of these remarks is summarized in a paragraph from the future goals study: if there is a single element (in statistics) that is new or deserves more emphasis it is the increasing need in today's world to make more clearly understood our contribution as statisticians to the welfare of man. while this has been a matter of concern for a long time, it has been so only in a somewhat limited way. when the asa constitutional goal ""to increase the contribution of statistics to human welfare"" was adopted, it probably referred largely to the gathering of data rather than to its analysis and use. now, as a discipline we have become increasingly concerned with methodology, techniques and applications over a much broader and often more complicated spectrum. as a result, we face the extremely difficult task of demonstrating to the world that statistical methods, techniques and applications are essential underpinning to analyzing problems in all areas of science and society, and provide useful ways of resolving real life problems that appear insoluble [2, p. 3]. i have tried to spotlight a few of the obstacles we must overcome if we are to accomplish this task. it is my considered judgment that we must accomplish it if statistics, however defined, is or are to remain a truly viable, socially meaningful discipline.",177,20.7231638418079,5.02181025081788,0.322791712104689,3668,1184,17.4535933312386,12.4535933312386,91,0.198158470598219,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1973.10481326"
1973,"68th","Hildreth, Clifford G.","Male","University of Minnesota","Academia","133rd","December 27–30, 1973","New York City, NY",NA,"Expected Utility of Uncertain Ventures",1973-12-28,"Clifford G. Hildreth","1970-1999","this article develops a simple model of economic decisions under un certaintyand applies it to several hypothetical decision problems. the main applications are to betting, since this context can be explained without much economics background and the analysis of betting has some practical implications for economic analysis, as well as posing some interesting intellectual problems. statisticians have long used gambling situations as checks on the reasonableness of tentative conclusions and as sources of hints for further useful developments. this article conveys some of the flavor of economic applications to statisticians and possibly stimulates additional interchanges with economists. for economists, present model’s principal addition to discussions in the current literature is that the decision maker is permitted to start with a random prospect rather than with fixed initial wealth and his current prospect may or may not be independent of the random ventures he contemplates. we start with a decision maker who has an opportunity to make a transaction that will affect his future wealth. he wishes to maximize the expected utility of future wealth in accordance with a von neumann morgenstern utility function and a set of personal probabilities on relevant future events. let p be a probability measure on a space specific sequence of developments in the decision makers’ environment changes in tax rates, level of national income, weather, etc. p expresses the decision maker’s personal probabilities of events in a a field 5 of subsets of q. if the decision maker (dm) engages in no new ventures, simply carrying out his present plans and commitments, his future wealth will depend on what happens in his environment according to a (measurable) function that will be called his current prospect and will be written x is a random variable and, in the absence of new undertakings, expected utility will be where cp is the dm’s utility of wealth function. returns from a possible new venture (purchase or sale of securities, purchase of insurance, a bet, a business contract, etc.) are also uncertain, i.e., these returns will also depend on. be returns from the venture being considered. then undertaking the venture changes the dm’s prospect and expected utility from wasting time on trivial ventures it is assumed that. most ventures can be undertaken in various amounts number of shares of stock, coverage of an insurance policy, etc. this means that if the venture y is available, other ventures ay are also available for certain admissible values of a. it will be convenient to initially assume that a can be any real number and then consider the effects of various restrictions.’ the formal problem is then to choose a to maximize. (1.1) since a utility function is determined only up to a positive linear transformation one may conveniently set a venture ay is then favorable if and is optimal. means the decision maker prefers more future wealth to less. means he is a risk averter. he will reject a gamble whose subjective expected value is nonpositive if the gambling event is independent of his current prospect. economists have found absolute risk aversion, defined by, a useful concept in characterizing behavior under uncertainty and typically assume that r decreases with increasing wealth. for and decreasing absolute risk aversion implies decreasing, but the converse does not hold. the weaker assumption, decreasing, is assumed 1 this is, of course, a highly simplified model. in many contexts multidimensional families of ventures need to be considered. frequently wealth is not the only desideratum so more general spaces of possible outcomes must be studied. since immediate choices affect circumstances in future periods, explicitly dynamic models are needed. each of these features has been used in studying special economic problem but general models applicable to wide segments of economic decision making are developing only slowly. throughout this article and r decreasing is invoked for particular propositions. the other conditions insure mathematical tractability. they seem plausible but are less subject to common sense verification (infinity is hard to contemplate in practical contexts). unless the venture y offers both positive probability of gain and positive probability of loss, either y or y is a sure thing (can win, can not lose). sure things are unlikely to be encountered in the real world and if one were encountered the response would be clear: take all that is offered. hence, it is assumed from here on that neither y nor y is a sure thing and the optimal amount d exists. is now clear that knowing would place the decision maker in a position to quickly evaluate a set of ventures ay with a restricted to a subset of r. for convenience, assume if both exist one would need to compare expected utilities at these two points. if a is not closed it may happen that there is no optimal venture, but one can then compare ventures correspond ing to a in a neighborhood of. 2. comparative statics this is the economist’s term for relations between optimal choices and circumstances faced by the decision maker. in principle we are interested in responses of b to various changes in. however, this is mostly unexplored territory and only changes in location parameters of x and y will be considered here. in this section we regard z and w as fixed functions of w and consider & as a function of x and h. if y is a security then it is natural to think of w as prospective returns from the security and h as the price. responses to changes in h will be called price effects even though, in some contexts, the decomposition of y may be arbitrary. if the decision maker receives an unexpected gift of c dollars and his beliefs are not changed, then is increased by c and z is unaffected. however, for brevity, we shall continue to use the x, y notation even though we are thinking of f , h as variables and taking expectations with respect to the distributions of. as in other economics contexts, the price response de composes into a term of known is clearly negative] which we shall call the pseudo substitution effect and a term proportional to the wealth response commonly called the wealth effect. in the remainder of the section, some circumstances in which are of known sign are investigated. note that if d and aa/ax are of the same sign, which is true in several propositions to follow, then aa/ah is known to be negative. for two of the propositions it is assumed that absolute risk aversion is decreasing. it was noted in section 1 that this is regarded as typical by most economists. it is thus reassuring to observe at the onset the existence of a broad, mathematically fairly tractable family of utility functions that satisfy 3. choice between a safe asset a security before attempting to analyze some aspects of betting with the aid of the model presented, it seems desirable to illustrate possible applications with at least one more conventional economic problem. the choice between investing in a security of unknown yield and an asset (is there one?) whose yield is regarded as known has been of interest. suppose a decision maker has current prospect v + c where c represents cash on hand and v represents prospective earnings, inheritances, liabilities for unforeseen accidents, etc. his cash will be used to purchase a safe asset with known return b (a negative purchase of the safe asset is interpreted as borrowing cash at interest rate b 1) and a security whose possible returns per share are represented by a random variable w and whose price per share is h. he wants to maximize expected utility of his holdings at a specified date in the future when return from both assets will be realized. these marginal responses presuppose that a can be any real number or that d is in the interior of the admissible set if there are restrictions. effects of boundary solutions will be briefly considered after some interpretation of. 7 will increase if there is the subjectively certain promise of a previously unanticipated windfall gain at the end of the time period under consideration. for example, a mysterious uncle appears with a terminal illness and provision for the decision maker in his will. then (3.3) determines whether a small such gain in creases or decreases &. from (3.5) we see, as is intuitively reasonable, that the effect on security purchases of an increment of current cash is b times the effect of a subjectively certain prospective increment of equal amount. there are two kinds of wealth wealth now and wealth at the end of the period. the cumulation factor b converts a unit of present wealth to a subjectively equivalent number of units of prospective wealth. in (3.4), an increase in w is a special kind of reevaluation of the prospects for the security. such a reevaluation could occur if a company experiences an unexpected gain that did not effect calculations of remaining prospects and decided to distribute the gain in end of period com mon stock dividends. the marginal result of such a reevaluation is the sum of a wealth effect proportional to holdings and a pseudosubstitution effect (3) known to be positive. the marginal effect of a change in price of the security is opposite in sign to the effect of a change in expected return and is multiplied by the rate of return on the safe asset, since price must be paid at the outset and expected return is available at the end of the period (3.6). as with price of a consumer good, the wealth effect is proportional to quantity and the substitution effect is known to be negative. the effect of an increase in yield of a safe asset on optimal purchase of an uncertain asset. this decomposes into a negative pseudosubstitution effect and a wealth effect proportional to holdings. an alternative representation is the sum of a wealth effect that would prevail if all cash were put in the safe asset less an allowance for cash put in the uncertain asset and a pseudosubstitution effect. application of the propositions of section 2 to the and the marginal responses determination of the signs of under the various conditions stated is straightforward. for instance, suppose v and w are independent. this might be approximately true if v depends largely on local circumstances and w on broader national and international developments. the expected return from a dollar’s worth of the security. if this exceeds the known return on the safe asset the decision maker will purchase some of the security. if in addition the decision maker’s absolute risk aversion decreases with increased wealth, then proposition 6 also applies and it is known that his security purchases will increase with increased wealth. from proposition 7, if the decision maker had constant risk aversion, increased wealth would leave security purchases unchanged. if expected return per dollar’s worth of security is less than, the latter assuming. this means the decision maker should optimally be in a short position, and should further sell short if wealth increases. if short sales are not permitted, then a =is optimal under this restriction. consider two decision makers. one has utility function, beliefs p, and initial prospect x. thus (marginal) utility of dependence tends to be positive if the venture promises gains in events on which returns from the current prospect are low. loosely speaking, one could say it has insurance value. a decision maker may then be said to have two possible motives to want a positive amount of a prospective venture expected gain and insurance value. considering again a pair of decision makers, an exchange of some multiple of a venture y can be mutually favorable only implies different beliefs; covariances of opposite sign imply different circumstances in the sense that at least some events that are relatively favorable judged by dm’s current prospect are viewed as relatively less favorable by dm. such comparisons can be discussed a little more simply and sharply if the contemplated exchanges are bets. proposition 10 indicates that, for some purposes, it is sufficient to consider bets. is called a plain venture. so two individuals have incentives to bet on an event a if their personal probabilities of a differ (in which case subjective odds also differ) and/or their relative needs on a differ. in section 5, some hypothetical examples of situations in which relative needs may be expected to differ are briefly considered. differing beliefs will be deferred to another occasion. the remainder of the article emphasizes a special potential application of the analysis of exchanges. emphasis on the special application should not obscure the fact that the main justification for analysis of ex changes is to improve our general understanding of decisions under uncertainty and to help us evaluate and improve various aspects of public and private decision making. in one of his pioneering papers on economic analysis of uncertainty, kenneth arrow 123 posed the question of adequacy of securities markets in permitting people to distribute their future resources over events in a satis factory way. while the model of this article would have to be substantially generalized to discuss this problem at all adequately, it seems to me to furnish some interesting insights even in its present form. basically, the problem is broader than adequacy of securities markets, since almost all transactions involve some adjustments of the individual’s circumstances under various future events. the welfare criterion economists most frequently use is that of a pareto optimum. a pareto optimum is an allocation of goods and resources in an economy in such a way that no reallocation could increase the utility of one or more individuals without lowering the utility of others. the existence of a mutually favorable exchange indicates how two individuals could exchange contingent wealth (or specific contingent commodities in a more general model) in a way that would increase their utilities without affecting others. thus the existence of a mutually favorable exchange is inconsistent with pareto optimality and one could look for mutually favorable exchanges as a way of demonstrating nonoptimality. from proposition 10, one sees that it is sufficient to check the existence of mutually favorable bets. in this section, consider that the individuals discussed have similar beliefs, so that any mutually favorable bets will imply different relative needs on the basic event. as noted in section 4, one purpose of looking for mutually favorable bets in either hypothetical economies or the real world is to check the adequacy of other opportunities individuals have for adjusting to future contingencies. apparently mutually favorable bets in the real world would have to be examined very carefully before final conclusions were drawn. the theory abstracts from transactions costs and possible difficulties of assuring performance, so these might mean that otherwise favor able bets would not really be favorable when all relevant factors were considered. even if it were firmly established that certain mutually favorable real world betting opportunities existed, it would not generally follow that people should negotiate bilateral bets. in all cases considered here, there are clearly various ways to achieve exactly or nearly the same adjustments. if bets should turn out to be the most satisfactory and economical transactions in some cases, it will likely be more efficient to organize markets rather than to rely on bilateral exchanges. call a paper promising the holder one dollar if the event a occurs a unit claim on a then the purchase of a unit claim at price y is the transaction. thus, the transactions could be depersonalized by having an agency sell unit claims on a wide variety of events at prices that were frequently adjusted to reflect supply and demand. this would just extend mutual betting to new events or it could be viewed as a conditional futures market in money. the following examples are hypothetical, but may be sufficiently suggestive of real world situations to assist those induced to make more serious investigations. a specialty crop suppose a hypothetical fruit, call them plones, is grown in a small geographic area and is very sensitive to rain during the ten day harvest period; a measurable rain almost completely ruining the crop. as harvest approaches, growers are in a precarious position having used most of their liquid assets to plant and cultivate. plones can be stored at moderate cost and each year there are warehouses with one fourth to one half of a crop in storage as harvest approaches. when the dates of harvest can safely be forecast, suppose the growers bet on rain and the warehousemen bet against rain during the harvest period. if it rains the growers will lose their crop but collect their bets. the warehousemen will pay out of the increased price of plones in storage. if it does not rain, the growers will pay out of the crop and the warehouse men will recover storage costs by winning bets. if growers sought security through the usual crop insurance, someone would have to verify the preharvest condition of the crop and the company and growers would have to negotiate their estimates of any losses incurred. this would add greatly to the cost. a bet should be much less expensive. all that would have to be verified would be rain or no rain at an agreed weather station in the growing region. if the region were small enough, rain at the weather station should be a good indicator of prob able damage. a grower who lost his crop even though there were no rain at the station would lose doubly, crop and bet, but if this compound event has sufficiently small probability, covering it may not be worth the loading added to an insurance premium. another way to achieve adjustments in this situation would be to establish a futures market in plones. growers could buy futures, warehousemen sell. formally this differs from the market for claims discussed in section 5 only in that the futures market deals in claims for goods rather than claims for money and the claim for goods is on the universal event money. if the future value of money is more certain than the future value of plones, then the market for money claims should permit participants to achieve a more stable new prospect. i believe this possibility as well as other comparisons between the two markets (administrative costs, probable effects of participation by people other than growers and warehousemen, etc.) should be studied under assumptions as close to real life circumstances as we can achieve. a merchant has put most of his liquid assets into inventories of seasonal items. if retail sales in his region hold reasonably well, he is almost sure he can sell enough to avoid severe financial strain. on the other hand, if there is a regional slump, there is not much he can do. suppose he bets that retail sales in his area will be less than 80 percent of normal. this clearly reduces the uncertainty in his prospect. there may not be a natural second party to take this bet at actuarial value, but, assuming a regional slump is his main hazard, he might well be able to afford to offer sufficiently good odds that people who hold conservative securities (and thus have current prospects largely independent of regional sales) would be induced to risk some of their funds. if the merchant tried to insure his own sales, both an incentive problem and a problem of verification would immediately arise. the merchant could make his coverage more precise by placing several bets one that regional sales would be 80 percent or less, one that they would be 70 percent or less, etc. an alternative arrangement in this case would be for the merchant’s suppliers to provide inventory on a flexible basis. one possibility would be for the final price to depend on regional sales. another would be for the retailer to be able to return part of the merchandise if regional sales are sufficiently low. a handicapped person contemplates an operation which, if successful, will greatly increase his earning power. if it fails his physical circumstances are about as before. suppose he bets the operation fails. if he loses the bet, he pays out of increased earnings. if he wins the bet and it covers the cost of the operation, he has not lost financially. the doctor and the hospital might be good prospects to take his bet. any effect on their incentives would certainly be in the right direction. the same final prospect could be achieved if the doctor and/or hospital charged more for successful operations than for unsuccessful ones. more generally this example might be regarded as representative of many situations in which a case might be made for paying for services according to the results instead of according to time spent or some other measure of input. the combination of a preferred prospect for the purchaser and possibly sharper incentives for the seller might sometimes produce the possibility of develop ing a mutually more satisfactory arrangement. perhaps some air travelers might like to bet that their baggage will not arrive on time. alternatively the airline might agree to refund part of the cost of a ticket when ever baggage does not arrive on time. the purchaser of a service is in a position closely analogous to that of a purchaser of a durable good. substantial uncertainty is introduced by the possibility that the durable may fail to perform. in the absence of warranties, purchasers would have reasons for betting that the durable would fail and sellers might be natural takers of such bets. warranties achieve virtually the same effects. if all purchasers are in the same circumstances, a single warranty plan might suffice. if purchasers have different utility functions and initial prospects then there could be substantial gain in offering a variety of warranty arrangements. someone on a fixed money income might consider betting that the consumer price index will rise at least x percent in the next ten years. this way of stabilizing one’s prospect would have to be compared with the possibility of purchasing securities yielding returns that might be expected to be positively correlated with the cost of living. i do not know how such a comparison would come out but it seems to me another problem worth serious study. for persons on social security, the government might be a natural second party. guaranteed cost of living adjustments were introduced in

are given to stress the depth and variety of such activities and the intellectual satisfactions to be derived from them. 1. critic’s complaint as may be apparent from my title, which is taken from g.h. hardy’s little masterpiece [17], this address is on a subject covered by numerous predecessors on this occasion what is statistics and where is it going? when one tries, spider like, to spin such a thread out of his viscera, he must say, first, according to dean acheson, “what do i know, or think i know, from my own experience and not by literary osmosis?” an honest answer would be, “not much; and i a m not too sure of most of it.’’ in that spirit, i shall start by considering a non statistical critic, perhaps a colleague on a statistics search committee, who is struck by what he calls the dependent character of statistics. every other subject in the arts and sciences curriculum, he explains, appears self contained, but statistics does not. although it uses mathematics, its criteria of excellence are not those of mathematics but rather impact on other subjects. similarly, while other subjects are concerned with accumulating knowledge about the external world, statistics appears concerned only with methods of accumulating knowledge but not with what is accumulated. i don’t deny, he says, that such activity can be useful (here he shudders), but why would anyone wish to do it? at this point he begins to wonder whether statisticians have any proper place in a faculty of arts and sciences, but being too tactful to say so, he tells, instead, one of those stories about lies, damned lies and statistics. he ends by quoting from the decalogue of auden’s phi beta kappa poem for 1946 in which academics are warned “. thou shalt not with statisticians nor commit a social science.” such an attitude is not uncommon. most statisticians have wondered at one time or another about their choice of profession. is it merely the result of a random walk or are there major elements of rationality to it? would one, in later years, in full knowledge of one’s interests and jerome cornfield is chairman, department of statistics. george washington university, and director, biostatistics center. 7979 old georgetown road, betheada, md. 20014. thin article is the presidential address delivered at the 134th annual meeting of the statistical association, august 27, 1974, st.

like moments i have contemplated the cancer cures i might have discovered had i gone into one of the biomedical sciences, and similar marvels for other fields. but advancing years bring realism, and i am convinced that the outcome of the random walk which made me a statistician was inevitable. the only state that was an absorbing one was statistics, and i am pleased that the passage time was so brief. to say why this is so, i must talk about both statistics and myself. 2. diversity of interests considering myself first, i point to an affinity with the quantum theorist pauli, between whom and all forms of laboratory equipment, it has been said, a deep antagonism subsisted. he had only to appear between the door jambs of any physics laboratory in europe for some piece of glassware to shatter. similarly, in my undergraduate class in analytic chemistry, no matter what solution i was given to analyze, even if only triply distilled water, i was sure to find sodium, a literal product, i was later told, of the sweat of my brow. in biology, i retraced the path of james thurber, the result of whose first effort to draw what he saw in a microscope was, it will be remembered, a picture of his own eye. observational science was clearly not for me, unless i intended to publish exclusively in the journal of irreproducible results, the famed journal which first reported the experiment in which one third of the mice responded to treatment, one third did not, and the other was eaten by a cat. although i enjoyed mathematics, i enjoyed many other subjects just as much, and a part time mathematician ends by being no mathematician at all. this interest in many phenomena and the sense that mathematics by itself is intellectually confining as edmund burke said of the law, sharpens the mind by narrowing it is characteristic of many statisticians. francis galton, for example, was active in geography, astronomy, meteorology and of course, genetics, to mention only a few. i have always thought that his investigation on the efficacy of prayer, in which he, among other things, compared the shipwreck rate for vessels carrying and not carrying missionaries, exhibits the quintessence of statistics [13]. charles babbage, the first chairman of the statistical section of the british association for the advancement of science and a leading spirit in the founding of the royal statistical society, was another from the same mold. he is perhaps the earliest example of a statistician lost to the field because of the greater attractions of computation. his autobiography 111 lists an awe inspiring number of other subjects in which he was interested, and no doubt the loss to each of them because of his youthful reaction to erroneous astronomical tables “i wish to god these calculations had been executed by steam” was equally lamentable. a wide diversity of interests is neither necessary nor sufficient for excellence in a statistician, but a positive association does exist. statisticians thus tend to be hybrids, and it was my own hybrid qualities, together with a disinclination to continue the drift into what henry adams called the mental indolence of history, that made the outcome of my random walk inevitable. 3. complex systems a n d statistics coming now to statistics, it clearly embraces a spectrum of activities indistinguishable from pure mathematics at one end and from substantive involvement with a particular subject matter area at the other. it is not easy to identify the common element that binds these activities together. quantification is clearly a key feature but is hardly unique to statistics. the distinction be tween statistical and nonstatistical quantification is elusive, but it seems to depend essentially on the complexity of the system being quantified ; the more complex the system, the greater the need for statistical description. once, many people believed that the necessity for statistical description in a system was due solely to the primitive state of its development. eventually, it was felt, biology would have its newton, then psychology, then economics. but since newtonian like description has turned out to be inadequate even for physics, few believe this anymore. some phenomena are inherently incapable of simple description. a number of years ago i gave as an example of such a class of phenomena the geography of the north continent [9]. i was not suggesting that the lewis and clark expedition would have benefited from the presence of a statistician if its objectives had been quantitative it might very well have but only that many scientific fields that are now descriptive and statistical may remain so for the indefinite future. 4. life sciences a n d statistics in the life sciences, the somewhat naive 19th century expectations as expressed most forcibly perhaps by the great french physiologist, claude bernard, have not been realized. bernard loathed statistics as inconsistent with the development of scientific medicine. in his introduction to the study of experimental medicine [2, pp. 137 ff.] he wrote “a great surgeon performs operations for stones by a single method; later he makes a statistical summary of deaths and recoveries, and he concludes from these statistics that the mortality law for this operation is two out of five. well, i say that this ratio means literally nothing scientifically and gives no certainty in performing the next operation. what really should be done, instead of gathering facts empirically, is to study them more accurately, each in its special determinism by statistics, we get a conjecture of greater or less probability about a given case, but never any certainty, never any absolute determinism only basing itself on experimental determinism can medicine become a true science, i.e., a sure science but indeterminacy knows no laws: laws exist only in experimental determinism, and without laws there can be no science.” it is ironic that more than a century later, scientific understanding of the biochemical factors governing the formation of gallstones has progressed to the point that their dissolution by chemical means alone has become a possibility [22], but one whose investigation, even now, must include a modern clinical trial with randomized allocation of patients and statistical analysis of results. in the view of many, bernard’s vision of a complete nonstatistical description of medical phenomena will not be realized in the foreseeable future. sir william osier was at least as close to the truth when he said that medicine will become a science when doctors learn to count. although the exclusively reductionist philosophy of bernard still dominates preclinical teaching in most medical schools, many important biomedical problems not amenable, in the present state of knowledge, to this form of attack have been and are being successfully investigated. in his presidential address to the association for cancer research [21], lmichael shimkin discussed one of the most well known of them, smoking and health, and ended by suggesting that a nobel prize for accomplishments on this problem be awarded and shared by richard doll and bradford hill, cuyler hammond and daniel horn and ernest wynder, three of whom are members of either the asa or the royal statistical society. a less well known biomedical activity, in which the impact of statistics is also becoming considerable, is the evaluation of food additives. even the most traditional of toxicologists has been compelled to admit that an experiment on n laboratory animals, none of whom showed an adverse reaction to an additive, does not establish, even for that species of animal, the absolute safety of that additive for any finite n, much less that the risk is less than 1 in n [18]. a more fundamental problem than either of these, that of brain function, is, according to one investigator, unlikely to be resolved by deterministic methods since its primary mode of function is believed by many to be probabilistic [4]. for none of these problems, nor for many others that could be listed, is a reductionist approach, let alone solution, anywhere in sight, and if the problems are to be attacked at all, they must be attacked statistically. this, of course, does not mean they must be attacked by statisticians. osler was questioning the unwillingness and not the inability of physicians to count, and many of them have shown that when they become involved in a problem that requires counting that they can do a pretty good job of it. no one, not even our hypothetical critic, questions that statisticians have a useful auxiliary role to play in such investigations. but the heart of his question and of my inquiry is why should any person of spirit, of ambition, of high intellectual standards, take any pride or receive any real stimulation and satisfaction from serving an auxiliary role on someone else’s problem. to prepare the ground for an answer, i shall first consider two examples taken from my own experience. 5. example: toxicity of amino acids the first example concerns a series of investigations on the toxicity of the essential amino acids undertaken by the laboratory of biochemistry of the national cancer institute [15]. they were motivated by the finding that synthetic mixtures of pure amino acids could have ad verse effects when administered to patients following surgery. an initial series of experiments had determined the dosage mortality curve in rats for each of the ten amino acids. the next step, the investigation of mixtures, threatened to founder at conception because there were over 1,000 possible mixtures of the ten amino acids that could be formed, and to study so many mixtures was clearly beyond the bounds of practicability. at the time these experiments were done, several methods for measuring joint effects had been proposed. their common feature was that they did not depend on detailed biochemical understanding of joint modes of action. the primitive but not very well defined notion to be quantified was that combinations may have effects that are not equal to the sum of the parts and that knowing this may lead to better understanding of modes of action. j. h. gaddum, the british pharmacologist who was one of the inventors of the probit method, discussed the quantification of the primitive notion in his pharmacology text with a simplicity and generality that contrasted with most of the other discussions then available [12]. he started with the idea that if drugs a and b were the same drug, even if in different dilutions, their joint effects were by definition additive. that definition implied that if amounts xa and xb of drugs a and b individually led to the same response, e.g., 50 percent mortality, then they were additive at that level of re sponse if and only if the mixture consisting of some fraction, p , of za and fraction (1 p ) of led to that same level of response for all p between zero and unity. this concept of additivity is different from that customarily used in statistics as may be seen by noting that, in the customary concept, if responses are additive, then log responses are not; but with gaddum’s concept, if drugs are additive with respect to a response, they are additive with respect to all one to one functions of that response. i shall refer to his concept of additivity as dosewise additivity to distinguish it from the customary statistical concept which is of response wise additivity. an alternative, then, to investigating the 1,023 possible mixtures of amino acids was to start with the concept of dosewise additivity. if the ten amino acids were in fact dosewise additive in their effects on mortality, further investigation of mixtures might be unrewarding, while large departures from additivity in either direction might provide insights into possible joint modes of action. my biochemical colleagues were initially quite unimpressed with this proposal. but since the dosage mortality curves for the individual amino acids were so steep that one half an ldag.9 (the dose estimated to be lethal for 99.9 percent of the animals) would elicit no more than a one to three percent mortality, they did agree to test it in a small experiment. the experiment consisted of using a mixture of one half the ld99.9’s of each of two amino acids. if response wise additivity held, this should have led to a two to six percent mortality, but dose wise additivity would have led to 99.9 percent mortality. although they didn’t say so at the time, the biochemists regarded this experiment as worth the investment of just two rats. but they did call me the next day to report that both rats had died, and then added in an awe stricken tone that would have gratified merlin himself, “and so fast.” once the usefulness of the model of dose wise additivity as a standard against which to appraise actual experimental results was accepted, my role became that of passive observer. but here the real biochemical fun began. the biochemists started with a single experiment in which a mixture of the ten amino acids, each at a dosage of one tenth their individual ld50, was administered to a group of rats. on the hypothesis of dosewise additivity, 50 percent should have died; in fact, none did. clearly, the different amino acids were not augmenting each other in the same way that each increment of a single amino acid augments the preceding amounts of that amino acid. a 50 percent kill was obtained only when the amount of each ingredient in the mixture was increased by about 70 percent. to investigate further the nature of this joint effect, ten separate mixtures were prepared, each containing nine of the amino acids at a dosage of one ninth x 1.7 their individual ld 50’s. at this point a wholly un expected result emerged. for all but one of the ten mixtures, the departures from additivity were of about the same magnitude as for the mixture containing all ten. but one of the mixtures, the one lacking l arginine, was much more toxic than the other nine, suggesting that, despite its toxicity when given alone, in a mixture l arginine was protective. a direct experiment confirmed this. the hypothesis was now advanced that the toxicity of each of the amino acids was due to the formation and accumulation of ammonia and that the protective effect of l arginine was a result of its ability, previously demonstrated in isolated biochemical systems, to speed up the metabolism of ammonia. a later series of experiments fully confirmed this hypothesis. a major advance in the understanding of the metabolism of amino acids was thus crucially dependent on a wholly abstract concern with appropriate ways to quantify the joint effects of two or more substances. 6. example: the electrocardiogram the other example is taken from ongoing work in the computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram, or ecg [s]. it is convenient to consider computerization as involving two nonoverlapping tasks. the first is measurement of the relevant variables, or in the specialized terminology of the field, wave recognition. the second is the combination of the variables to achieve an interpretation, or as it is sometimes called, a diagnosis. the function of the wave recognition program is to summarize the electrical signal which shows voltage as a function of time for each of a number of leads. there are characteristic features to this signal which take the form of maxima and minima and which can be related to various phases of the heart cycle. these features are referred to as waves and the wave recognition program locates the beginning and end of each wave. from these, a series of variables is defined and their values computed. the signal has thus been transformed into a vector of variables. the wave recognition procedures of the different groups that have developed computerized interpretations all agree in principle, although there are important differences in detail, and hence, in accuracy. the interpretation phase of the different programs does involve an important difference of principle, however. traditional reading of the ecg by a cardiologist involves the use of certain decision points. thus, the ecg is traditionally considered “consistent with an infarct” if it manifests one or more special characteristics, such as a q wave of 0.03 sec. or more in certain leads, but normal if it manifests none of these characteristics. nfost groups have simply taken such rules and written them into their programs. headed by dr. hubert pipberger, the veterans administration group, with which i have been involved, has elected, instead, to proceed statistically by collecting ecg’s on a large number of individuals of known diagnostic status normals, those having had heart attacks, etc., and basing the rules on the data by using standard multivariate procedures rather than on a priori decision points. this statistical approach distinguishes the veterans administration program from all the others now available. at this point, i shall consider just a secondary aspect of the general program, the detection of arrhythmias, and a restricted class of arrhythmias at that those which manifest themselves in disturbances of the rr rhythm. the time between the r peaks of the ecg for two successive heart beats is termed an rr interval, and the problem mas to base a diagnosis on the lengths of the successive rr intervals. from a formal statistical point of view, each patient is characterized by a sequence of values t l , t 2 t , which can be considered a sample from a multivariate distribution. if the distribution is multi variate normal and stationary, the sufficient statistics for any sequence of intervals are given by the mean interval, the standard deviation and the successive serial correlations. thus, the rr arrythmias should be classifiable in terms of these purely statistical attributes. even before looking at any data, this formal scheme seemed to provide an appropriate quantification for this class of arrhythmias. high and low mean values for a patient correspond to what are called tachycardias and bradycardias. high standard deviations characterize departures from normal rhythm ; while the different types of departures, the atrial fibrillations and the premature ventricular contractions which must be distinguished because of their different prognoses could be distinguished by their differing serial correlations. a statistician familiar only with the purely formal aspects of stationary time series and multivariate normal distributions and entirely innocent of cardiac physiology, as i am, is nevertheless led to an appropriate quantification. when these ideas are tested by classifying ecg’s from patients with known rhythmic disturbances, about 85 percent are correctly classified [zs]. because of the simplicity of the scheme, a small special purpose computer, suitable for simultaneous bedside monitoring of eight to ten patients in a coronary care unit, seems feasible and is under active investigation. 7. key role of interactions having placed this much emphasis on the examples, i am a little embarrassed at the possibility that they will have failed to show that there is stimulation and satisfactory in working on someone else’s problem. compared with, say, the revolution in molecular biology and the breaking of the genetic code, the activities described are admittedly pretty small potatoes. nevertheless, both the scientific problems and the statistical ideas involved are nontrivial and the essential dependence of the final product on the blending of the two is characteristic. the role of statistics was central, not auxiliary. the same results could not have been attained without statistics simply by collecting more data. important though efficient design and minimization of the required number of observations are, they are by no means all that statistics has to contribute, and both examples highlight this. they also seem to refute the common statement, “if you need statistics, do another experiment,” if yet another refutation were needed, the variety of mathematical ideas and applications in science and human affairs that flows from the primitive notion of quantifying characteristics of populations as opposed to explaining each individual event in its own special determinism” would come as a surprise to william petty, john graunt, edmund halley and the other founding fathers. the steps from them to the idea of a population of measurements, described by theoretical multivariate distributions, and then to the theory of optimal decisions based on samples from these distributions all of which were needed to lay the foundations for the ecg application resulted from the efforts of some of the best mathematical talents of our era. with these developments at our disposal, we are, astonishingly, at the heart of the problem of computerizing the interpretation of the ecg. for if we take as our goal minimum misclassification error or minimum cost of misclassification, statistical procedures of the type used by the veterans administration group can be shown to be preferable to computerization of the traditional cardio logic procedures [lo]. a statistician who finds himself at one of the many symposia devoted to this problem is prepared to address the central and not the peripheral issues involved. and in that rapid shift from theory to practice, so characteristic of statistics, he can also sketch out the design of a collaborative study comparing the performance of the different programs, which could con firm or deny this claim [19]. i must, however, not exaggerate. statistics, although necessary for this problem, is certainly not sufficient. the problem requires clinical engineering and many other skills as well. a test relates to the entire package and not just the statistical component, and this is true for most statistical applications. it will be remembered that a well designed, randomized test of the effectiveness of cloudseeding foundered on the fact that hunters used as targets the receptacles intended for the collection and measurement of the amount of rainfall, thus fatally impairing the variables needed for evaluation. it is for this as well as for other reasons that no one has ever claimed that statistics was the queen of the sciences a claim which, even for mathematics, was dependent on a somewhat restricted view of what constituted the sciences. i have been groping for a more appropriate noun than ‘(queen, ” something less austere and authoritarian, more democratic and more nearly totally involved, the best alternative that has occurred to me is “bed fellow.” “statistics bedfellow of the sciences” may not be the banner under which we would choose to march in the next academic procession, but it is as close to the mark as i can come. 8. examples of interactions how can a person so engaged find the time to maintain and develop his or her grasp of statistical theory, without which one can scarcely talk about the stimulation and satisfaction that comes from successful work on someone else’s problem? the usual answer is to distinguish between consultation and research and to insist that time must be reserved for the latter. this answer comprehends only part of the truth, however, because it overlooks the complementary relation between the two. application requires understanding, and the search for understanding often leads to, and cannot be distinguished from, research. the true joy is to see the breadth of application and breadth of understanding grow together, with the un planned fallout the pure gravy, so to speak being the new research finding. it sometimes turns out not to be so new, but aside from the embarrassing light this casts on one’s scholarship, should not be regarded as more than a minor misfortune. it is hard to give examples of these interactions which don’t become unduly technical or too long, but some of the issues involved in sequential experimentation may give a glimpse of the process. many years ago in trying to construct a sequential screening test which would require fewer observations than the standard six mouse screen then being used by an nih colleague, i was both crushed and baffled to find that, using the sequential t test, more than six observations were required to come to a decision no matter what the fjrst six showed. this was crushing because the increase in efficiency promised could not be realized, and baffling because inability to reach a decision after six observations, no matter how adverse to the null hypothesis they might be, seemed not only inefficient, but downright ridiculous. much fruitless effort was spent in the following years long after the problems at which the six mouse screen had been directed had been solved trying to understand the difficulty; but only after i realized that the sequential test, unlike the fixed sample size one, was choosing between two alternatives was the problem clarified. observations really adverse to the null hypothesis were almost equally adverse to the alternative and, hence, because of the analytic machinery of the sequential test, considered indicative of a large standard deviation, even if all the observations were identical. in light of this large standard deviation, the trst naturally called for more data before coming to a decision. but if a composite rather than a simple alternative with respect to the mean were considered, or, as i now prefer to say it, if prior probabilities were assigned to the entire range of alternatives with respect to the mean, rejection of the null hypothesis even after two sufficiently adverse observations was possible, and the puzzle disappeared [s]. the problem was intimately connected with the role of stopping rules in the interpretation of data a question of great importance for the clinical trials with which i was becoming involved. from this line of investigation, i concluded, as had others who had previously considered the problem, that in choosing among two or more hypotheses, stopping rules were largely irrelevant to interpretation and, in particular, that it made no difference whether the experiment was a fixed sample size or a sequential one. data is data, just as in the old story, “pigs is pigs.” but the problem does not end there. as piet hein puts it, “any problem worthy of attack/proves its worth by hitting back. ,’ it is not always easy or even possible to cast all hypothesis testing problems in the form of a choice between alternatives. isolated hypotheses, for which alternatives cannot be specified, also arise and for these the stopping rule does matter. thus. the original form of the va algorithm for the computerized interpretation of the ecg computed the posterior probability that an individual fell in one of a number of predesignated diagnostic entities, and this probability provided the basis for a choice between these alternative hypotheses. but a difficulty was posed by the occasional patient who did not fall into any of the diagnostic entities built into the algorithm which then tended, in desperation, to spread the posterior probabilities over all the entities that were built in. to avoid this, we might have tried to incorporate more entities into the algorithm, but even in principle this appeared impossible. nobody knows them all. what seemed clearly required, and is now being added to the algorithm, is a classical tail area test of the hypothesis that a patient falls in one of these predesignated diagnostic entities, to be used as a preliminary screen. if this hypothesis is rejected, the posterior probabilities, being inappropriate, would not be computed. but this commits one to a dualism in which stopping rules sometimes matter and sometimes don’t, which is philosophically distasteful, but which seemingly cannot be avoided. there is perhaps comfort in the story about the physicist, who, in a similar dilemma, considered light a particle on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays, a wave on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays and who, on sunday, prayed. however sketchy, this illustration of the interaction between theory and practice should indicate that the usual dichotomy is a false one, detrimental to both theory and practice. critical attention to application ex poses shortcomings and limitations in existing theory which, when corrected, leads to new theory, new applications and a new orthodoxy in a loop which may be never ending, and whose convergence properties are in any event unknown. 9. noninferential aspects of statistics this discussion has the disadvantage of giving more emphasis than i would wish to the inferential and, in particular, to the hypothesis testing aspects of statistics. statistical theory, instruction and practice have tended to suffer from overemphasis on hypothesis testing. its major attraction in some applications appears to be that it is admirably suited for the allaying of insecurities which might better have been left unallayed, or, as tufte puts it, for sanctification. i recall one unhappy situation in which an investigator castigated the statistician whose computer based p values had not alerted him to the possibility that his data interpretation had overlooked some well known, not merely hypothetical, hidden vari ables. both investigator and statistician might have been better off without the p values and with a more quantitative orientation to the actual problem at hand. the concept of dosewise additivity of the first example provides another noninferential example of quantification in statistics. of course, multivariate normality implies linear relations so that, even if additivity were not a constant theme in most branches of science, an interest in it is a natural consequence of a statistician’s other interests. but it is doubtful if the concept of dosewise additivity would ever have been developed abstractly as a natural consequence of other statistical ideas, if not for its importance in interpreting joint effects in certain kinds of medical experimentation. there are many other problems in quantification which are noninferential in which statisticians could nevertheless profitably be more active. the wave recognition aspects of the ecg interpretation, referred to earlier, provides one such example. many of the computer based image processing techniques, e.g., for chromosomes and for trans axial reconstruction of brain lesions, provide others. engineers and computer scientists have been more heavily involved in such problems than statisticians, largely, i am afraid, because they are in closer contact with the real problems and more willing to pursue non traditional lines of inquiry. besides computer based applications, many problems in modeling biochemical, physiological or clinical processes are mathematically interesting and substantively rewarding. i was involved in a few such applications [zo, 11, 71, as were other statisticians, but as a profession we could do more. if we don’t, others will. 10. necessity for outside ideas it is much more respectable than it once was to acknowledge that statistical theory cannot fruitfully stand by itself. there was a time when many statisticians would have applauded george gamow’s account [14, p. 34) of david hilbert’s opening speech at the joint congress of pure and applied mathematics, at which hilbert was asked to help break down the hostility that existed between the two groups. as gamow tells it, hilbert began by saying, “we are often told that pure and applied mathematics are hostile to each other. this is not true. pure and applied mathematics are not hostile to each other. pure and applied mathematics have never been hostile to each other. pure and applied mathematics will never be hostile to each other. pure and applied mathematics cannot be hostile to each other because, in fact, there is absolutely nothing in common between them.” but i think that today most of us would be more sympathetic with von neumann’s account [23, p. 20631 : “as a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from ‘reality’, it is beset with very grave dangers. it becomes more and more purely aestheticieing, more and more purely ?art pour tart this need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, of if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well developed taste. but there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multiple of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. in other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much ‘abstract’ in breeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. at the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. , whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the reinjection of more or less directly empirical ideas. i am convinced that this was a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject and that this will remain equally true in the future.” a rejuvenating return to the source will involve more, however, than sitting in on a few consultations or leafing through a subject matter article or two in the hope that they will suggest interesting mathematical problems. a definite expenditure of time and intellectual energy in one or more subject matter areas is required, not because they will necessarily generate mathematical problems but because the areas are of intrinsic interest. this is well understood and would hardly be worth repeating if there were not some corollaries that are sometimes overlooked. the first is that the certainties of pure theory are not attainable in empirical science or the world of affairs. more subtle or at least different critical faculties are needed to appraise scientific evidence than are needed for evaluating a formal mathematical proof. for example, in his double helix [24], watson speaks scornfully of those contemporaries who were unable to see that avery’s experiment made virtually inevitable the idea that the nucleic acids rather than the proteins were the source of the genetic material. however it may have seemed at the time, the subsequent course of events has confirmed watson’s judgment. ability to see where evidence is pointing before the last piece is in, and, contrariwise, ability to see the numerous directions in which it is pointing from only the first piece, requires as much cultivation by the statistician interested in the field as by the specialists, perhaps more. taking an example a little closer to mathematics, the well known set theorist zermelo was also interested in physics and, in fact, translated willard gibbs’ work on statistical mechanics into german. he was so over whelmed with its logical deficiencies, however, that his remaining contributions to statistical mechanics consisted of attacks on gibbs. it remained for other physicists, who, although also interested in logical purity, were equally interested in the subject matter, to take the constructive step of modifying gibbs’ formulation to eliminate the deficiencies [3]. in statistical applications one can detect this same search for purity, as manifested in a reluctance to make assumptions, even though they can lead to important simplifications when approximately true, or in an un willingness to admit prior probabilities even when, as in the diagnosis problem, they have a well defined frequency interpretation and are required for optimum properties. it also shows up in a certain type of statistical criticism of scientific results, in which pointing to a potential weakness is considered equivalent to demolition. bross’ [ 5 ] proposed ground rule for statistical criticism that some effort to demonstrate the reality as well as the potentiality of the weakness be required does not seem to have dimmed this quest for purity, at least as manifested in some recent statistical criticisms. a second corollary is that any but a nominal movement towards applications will have profound implications for graduate education. students need a thorough grounding in theory, but they need a perhaps equally thorough supervised exposure to the world of applications, and this latter exposure will compete with time now devoted to theory. every one will have his own choice of dispensable subjects, but the major problem is how to provide the applications. all too often we have behaved like a hypothetical medical school which turned out physicians with no internship or residency training, and in some cases with no training beyond the pre clinical basic science courses. the better students would no doubt overcome this deficiency in time, but the patients could scarcely be expected to welcome their initial ministrations. a formal statistical internship with a commitment of time comparable to that of the medical intern is a desirable step in the direction of applications. but we need the equivalent of the teaching hospital as a source of problems as well, and in most cases this will require arrangements with government and/or industry. the asa, i am pleased to report, has taken some significant steps in this direction; but a great deal more remains to be done, not only by asa, but by everyone interested. but i have wandered a bit from my main theme the apology. i have no new ideas to add to what i have already said and if my hypothetical critic, like some of my real ones, is still unconvinced, he must remain so. as justice holmes said, “you cannot argue a man into liking a glass of beer.” but i do want to amplify slightly my earlier expression of pleasure at having spent so little time in finding out that i was destined to be a statistician and not any of the other things that my friends and relatives thought i might be. i came to washington during the great depression, taking a job in the bureau of labor sta tistics, at the princely salary of $1,368 per year not per month. it didn’t take long, however, to become interested in a variety of statistical problems embedded in the social and economic problems of the time. the department of agriculture was then publishing what it called an adequate diet at minimum cost, but i doubted, in the arrogance of youth, that anyone involved knew how to find a minimum. it soon turned out that neither did i. the minimization of a linear function subject to a set of linear constraints was not covered in my calculus text and was beyond my powers to develop although it is now made clear in texts for freshman. but there were plenty of other problems to keep one occupied, some within my powers. nobody knew how many unemployed there were, and sampling seemed the way to find out. learning, developing and applying sampling theory was my first really exciting post school intellectual experience. statistics had me hooked, and the monkey has been on my back ever since. in later years, it came as a pleasant surprise to find out that other people were watching appreciatively. it would have been less than human not to take pleasure in the consultantships, memberships in review and advisory committees and, most of all, in the very great honor you have done me by electing me president of the statistical association. but, of course, these are simply the visible symbols. whitehead [25, p. 2251, at one point, speaks of “. the human mind in action, with its ferment of vague obviousness, of hypothetical formulation, of renewed insight, of discovery of relevant detail, of partial understanding, of final conclusion, with its disclosure of deeper problems as yet unsolved.” i can perhaps avoid presumption and still suggest that the portrait i have tried to sketch is not wholly unlike whitehead’s image of a mind in action, and that the statistician’s apology and justification is neither more nor less than that the practice of his profession requires exactly that.",281,25.1281138790036,4.97564084407308,0.274182127177454,7061,1936,19.0715987422265,14.0715987422265,12,0.35939098888707,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1975.10480253"

Frankel","1970-1999","exactly 20 years ago in the city of atlanta, warren weaver, then president of the association for the advancement of science, gave his presidential address. his topic was ""science and people” [19]. in his presentation weaver spoke of the development of science and how accomplishments in each of the disciplines had benefited people. in discussing the relationship between science and people, he took the traditional approach that, except for general, moral and financial support, the direction of influence is only one way : from science to people. when we consider the relationship between statistics and people, it is necessary to take into account that there is a two way flow of influence. where statistical conclusions are used to make decisions, the lives of people are affected. on the other hand, the basic bits of information from which these conclusions are derived are supplied by people. the statistician is involved in both the collection of data and in the formulation of conclusions based on the data that has ben collected for his finished product. in this context he has two classes of responsibility. the first is to the users of his product and the second is to the people who supply the raw material. as a producer of summary measures, the statistician has become increasingly aware of this responsibility. this is because statistics in general and sample surveys in particular have become important tools in the decision making process. the decisions made at the government level decide, for example, whether a government program should be continued or terminated, or how federal funds for revenue sharing should be allocated among the states. among the regulatory agencies (fda, ftc) of the federal government, the use of statistical data obtained from sample surveys is necessary to arrive at equitable decisions for certain courses of action. in the private sector, statistical decision making based on survey evidence has become widespread. the decision as to whether to introduce a new product is often based on consumer acceptance of the product in a test environment. the success or failure of a magazine or a television show depends on advertiser support which, in turn, is determined by industry wide surveys of t h r sizes and characteristics of the audiences of their media. in the fields of health and education, statistical decision making techniques are used quite extensively. the statistical relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer and the use of iq and aptitude test results are but two examples. we are all familiar with these examples. they illustrate the uses of statistics. because of our training to be objective and to think in abstract terms, we tend to regard the consequences of our work in an impersonal manner. decisions that are made on the basis of statistical evidence do affect people on an individual basis. if, as a result of an incorrect conclusion, a wrong decision is made, a person may suffer unjustifiably. when a television show is discarded because it is obtaining low ratings, dozens of people may suffer. these people include the producer, assistant producer, the actors, musicians, technical staff, and other back up personnel. the statistician’ has to assume responsibility to the extent that statistical conclusions are used. he has to be certain that the statistical evidence he produces is the most accurate possible ; that any inaccuracies inherent in the data are pointed out ; and that the user of the data know exactly what was measured and understands the underlying concept of the measurement. the statistical profession has always exhibited a sense of responsibility in calling attention to the existence of error in statistical measurements. this may have been caused by the fact that one of the characteristics of statistical inference is that it is a type of inference where it is possible to assign measures of uncertainty. as the utilization of the sample survey increased, statisticians felt and assumed a growing responsibility for the accuracy of measurements produced by this instrument. as a result, the treatment of error became highly sophisticated. in the sample survey reports produced in the 1930s the concept of the statistical sampling error was emphasized. this is the error which arises because a sample of units is examined and not the entire population. the meaning of this type of error was described to the non statistician in the technical appendices of many reports which stated, the sampling error is a measure of the difference between the sample estimate and the value that could be obtained through a complete census with the same procedure and identical execution. two times the sampling error, etc. with this statement, there is no reference to “truth” or “true value.” in fact, the statement is worded in such a manner to avoid any such reference. while this concept was comforting and perhaps justifiable to the theoretical statistician, it represented an evasion of responsibility to the survey statistician. the survey statistician wants to utilize the sample technique to arrive at a “true” value that would be of use and not at “a value that would have been obtained had a complete count been made.” the next step was the introduction of the mean square error. the mean square error is defined as the sampling error squared plus the error squared between the complete count estimate and the true value. it takes into account the errors due to the sampling process itself and the errors and biases that arise because of nonsampling reasons. one type of nonsampling error is the error which is due to nonobservation. this is generally referred to as nonresponse and it encompasses failure to reach the designated individuals in the sample, as well as not obtaining any information from these individuals even if they are reached. the next type of error is that which arises in the process of making an observation. this type encompasses response error and response bias. errors of this type arise because of faulty communication between interviewer and respondent, including the misunderstanding of questions, and the inability of the respondent to provide the correct response. as the popularity of the sample survey grew and survey results received much attention, another type of error became recognized. this is known as the error of definition. a certain phenomenon is to be observed and quantified. before any measurements can be made, it is necessary to define the phenomenon. this definition should meet two requirements. first, the phenomenon should be precisely defined. second, however the phenomenon is defined, i can be measured. the difficulty in dealing with this type of error is that the two require ments may not be consistent and that a compromise may be required. consider the case of “unemployment.” this phenomenon has been measured each month since december 1939 based on the activity of a person during a particular week of the month. since its inception, there has been some controversy as to the adequacy of the operational definition used. some economists are maintaining that in the current economic situation, the figures produced by the bureau of the census and released by the bureau of labor statistics do not measure unemployment for specified groups of the population. the figures produced by the current population sample, they claim, are misleading to government decision makers. the responsibilities of the statistician as the producer of these measures are clearly defined. in recognizing that his data are used for decision making purposes, he is concerned with the problem of eliminating or at least minimizing the effects of error in his estimates. in pre paring these estimates, the statistician uses designs which minimize the total survey error within the administrative restraints. he calls attention to and, insofar as possible, identifies the various components of error. to serve the users of his data, the statistician is constantly seeking new and efficient frames for sampling. he is seeking new methods for stratification and for estimation. in addition, he insures that the user of his measurements has a clear idea of exactly what has been measured. the concern that statisticians have for this class of responsibilities can best be demonstrated by examining the program of this annual meeting and noting how many papers deal with the problems i have just mentioned. i would now like to discuss the second class of responsibilities, mindful that some of these responsibilities will be in conflict with those just mentioned. these are the responsibilities that the statistician has to the people who are the suppliers of the basic elements of data from which statistical conclusions are drawn. the contents of the minds of people are the raw materials with which the survey statistician works. while the amount of this material is almost infinite, there exists the possibility that the access to this may be choked off. in fact, in some parts of the country the obtaining of sample survey data by means of personal interviews is prohibited by local ordinance. let us see how this situation developed. people in the us. first became aware of sample surveys during the mid 1930s. public opinion polls based on “scientific sampling methods” replaced the straw votes conducted by newspapers. market research studies were conducted to determine people’s likes and dislikes for certain products. while the methods used at the time were crude by today’s practices, these surveys more often than not provided information that turned out to be correct. there was a certain glamour involved when a poll consisting of a carefully selected sample of 2,500 people was able to predict the outcome of the roosevelt landon election, when a straw vote consisting of several million ballots could not. people vied to be included in the sample and to be part of that group whose “opinions really counted.” they boasted to their friends when they were interviewed. in the late 1930s the federal government entered the field of sample surveys. in addition to the sample study of unemployment, other sample studies were conducted immediately before and during world war i1 to aid the war effort. vacancy studies and rental price studies were conducted in many cities to aid in the determination of defense plant locations. studies of consumption were conducted tr) drtrrminr ration points. in these instances, people had patriotic motives to cooperate and supply the needed information to interviewers. the enthusiastic rcywnsr to being intervimved continued well beyond the end of world war 11. almost from infancy, sample surveys became abused : not in the sense that the findings could be used for some nialrficient purpose, but in the abuse of techniques. in high schools, teachers of social studies and mathematics would often, as teaching exercises, have the students conduct projects whereby they would go out and conduct surveys on some inane subject. the questionnaire used by many business organizations became longer and longer. the maximum length was ascertained through a series of pretests and the questionnaire stopped just short of the breaking point of the patience of the respondent. the subject matter of many of the surveys caused some embarrassment or discomfort. the times when tho interview n rrc conducted were often inconsiderate. a telephone would ring at 7 a.m., and the caller would want to know if the radio \\as turned on and, if it was, to what station. about this time, a numbrr of shrewd and unscrupulous business operators saw an unusual opportunity to take advantage of the average person’s willingness to participate in a survey. a saks manager in one of the major automobile companies engaged a firm that did sales promotion and market research. in the course of one week, persons hired by this company would telephone all households in a town and, under the guise of making a survey, ask for the year, model, and make of auto mobiles owned by the family, and whether there was an intention of purchasing a new car within the next year. the names and addresses of these intenders were then turned over to the local sales agency of the car manufacturer. in another (‘as(’, the sales organization of the publisher of a world famous encyclopedia made use of a unique plan for door to door selling. the salesman would pose as an interviewer, obtain access to a dwelling unit and determine whether there w r r any grade school children in the family. if thew were, h r would make a sales presentation. as a consequence of the first action in those towns where telephone calls were made to all residences, it was impossible to conduct legitimate studies for there to five months. the refusal rates averaged 40 percent in these cities. fortunately, before too many cities were contaminated, the market research department of this automobile company became aware of the plan conceived by the sales department and put a stop to it. as a consequence of the actions by the encyclopedia company, a number of small towns passed ordinances against personal interviewing. in other communities, regulatory ordinances were passed. the regulations included registering with local authorities, obtaining a license, or a permit for a fee, and being fingerprinted and/or photographed by local police [l]. while these regulations were severe, they did not have too much effect upon sample surveys. they were local ordinances and were not enforced when surveys were conducted by federal or s ta t r governments. also, since the number of persons living in these communities is small about one tenth of one percent of the total population in the country the loss in generalizations by defining these communities out of the universe is, for nationwide surveys, inconsequential. ten years ago frederick stephan, a former president of the american statistical association, pointed out that the greater part of opinion research rests on the kindness, confidence, and cooperation of the public in an interview [13]. hci was concerned that the abuses which were beginning to occur would lead to the erosion of the relationship between interviewer and respondent. about five years ago there were some feelings among people engaged in survey research that response rates were beginning to decline. to obtain a prospectus of the situation, in 1973 our association sponsored, with support of the national science foundation, a conference on surveys of human populations. certain findings emerged. first, even though there was a general feeling that the response rate had declined, no hard data were available to support this contention. this lack of data, it was fdt, came about first, because records of nonresponse were not kept by many survey organizations ; and second, among those that kept records, there was a reluctance to admit to a sup posed weakness of its operation by not being able to interview all designated respondents. the extent of the decline in response rates was exaggerated, due to a change in tho sampling procedures used by many survey organizations. these companies changed their sampling method from quota sampling to prob ability sampling. with the former type of sampling, the concept of nonresponse does not exist because individuals are not predesignated to be included in the sample. with a probability sample the response rate is the ratio of persons actually interviewed to those designated to be interviewed. for these operations nonresponse went from zero in the quota sample to positive fixed percentages in the probability sample. nonresponscemay be due to two causes: first, the inability to find people at home at the time the inter viewer calls, and second, the refusal of persons at home to be interviewed. during the period from 1960 70, there was an increase in the mobility of the population and the census bureau reported a sharp increase in the percentage of persons not at home at specified hours during the day [15]. if this were the only cause for the decline in response rate, we would not be too concerned. time, effort, and money would eradicate the situation. how ever, it was felt that the increase of nonresponse was due to the increase in the refusal rate brought about by an increasing reluctance of people to be interviewed. this situation is forcing us, as statisticians, to examine very critically the relationship between the interviewer and the respondent. are we doing something wrong? perhaps we are not treating the respondent with respect, as a human bring. there is a tendency among statisticians to regard the person as only incidental to the information about the person. statisticians are taught to think this way. r.a. fisher, the father of modern statistical inferencer said of his classic statistical for research workers, if we have records of the stature of 10,000 recruits, it is rather the population of statures than the population of recruits that is open to study. when we collect data in a survey had a tendency to depersonalize. this occurs even in a study whose objective is to measure personality or a person’s feeling towards certain objects. we attempt to measure subjective feelings and concepts through the use of objective instruments, such as guttman, elickert, or semantic differential scales. in the interview process itself we have the tendency to be concerned only with the respondent in his capacity as a data supplying vehicle. we worry as to whether we have fully communicated the exact intent of our questions ; whether the respondent has given or is even capable of giving the correct answer; the extent of the bias in response; whether the respondent is so fatigued after 60 minutes of interviewing that we cannot rely on the responses to the last ten questions on the questionnaire. in our attempts to obtain the most accurate information possible from a respondent, we recognize that are dealing with the human mechanism, but tend to ignore the fact that we are dealing with a human bring. this person is about to volunteer to supply us with information has certain rights and it is our responsibility to respect their rights. the potential respondent in a survey has two basic rights. the first is the right of informed consent and the second is their right of safety. by informed consent it is meant that a person should have the right to decide whether to participate in a survey after being told the immediate purpose of the study, how his name was selected, and the burden involved in terms of time and effort required to complete an interview. in addition, he should be told of the extent to which information that he supplies will be circulated with or without personal identification. the ability to control how information about oneself is used it should be given free circulation is the of the right of privacy. the second basic right of respondents is the right of safety. the respondent should not be harmed in any way; physically, emotionally or psychologically during the course of an interview or subsequent to the interview.’ it is the statistician’s responsibility to provide the potential respondent complete information so that the have suggested a third right. this is the right to be informed of all aspects of the research. in some cases it may happen that giving the respondent complete information as to the purpose of the study may introduce a bias in response. in such cases the respondent. on completion of the interview. should he debriefed and offered complete information as to the purposes and procedures used in the study as well as the results. to participate in a survey can he exercise intelligently. even though a person has decided to cooperate in a study, he will not know all of the details involved and it is the responsibility of the statistician to insure that the right of safety is maintained. statisticians have assumed their responsibilities. it is unfortunate that many practitioners in the survey area have given only lip service to their responsibilities. 2. in describing the purpose of a study, it sometimes happens that to obtain consent the respondent is told of only one specific purpose, in fact, the survey results will be used for other purposes, many of which were unanticipated when the study was designed. the respondent should be told of the specific purpose and also that other uses may be made of the results. if a guarantee of anonymity is required in a personal interview, the user of the randomized response technique or a secret ballot is recommended. through these devices no one, not even the interviewer, is certain of the respondent’s answer to the questions here the technique is applied. 4. to obtain cooperation, a researcher will tell a respondent that his replies will be kept in strict confidence. the researcher may really believe he can do so, and will do his utmost to protect the confidentiality of response, but he may be helpless in the face of subpoenas and other court actions. there are only a few cases where immunity to subpoena of statistical records is provided. before making this promise, it would be well for the researcher to consult an attorney well versed in this particular aspect of the law. this is particularly true where the survey attempts to measure illicit behavior. 5. the potential respondent is told that his or her responses will be used for statistical purposes only. the well informed respondent visualizes a statistical table with columns and row and percentages derived from thousands of observations. other respondents and even the same ones interpret this phrase to mean that after the information has been supplied, the data will go into a computer and the individual will not be bothered again.* the statistician should be sure that when he uses the words “statistical purpose that is what he intended. often two phase statistical surveys are conducted where the statistical purpose of the first phase is to collect information concerning the absence or presence of various characteristics from a sample of individuals. subsequently, more intensive interview arc made with all or with a subsample of individuals possessing the sought characteristics. the respondent never expected to be reinterviewed and in a way was misled. if follow up interviews arc required, the respondent should be informed. happens that the interviewing process itself can inflict harm on a respondent by inducing an emotional stress. a number of years ago plans were made to do a survey among noninstitutionalized senior citizens persons 65 years of age and older who were living in house holds. there were a number of questions that dealt with their housing conditions, medical care, and relations with their children. it was suggested that to obtain an indication of the current mental outlook, a question be used which asked the respondent to recall the saddest time in his or her life and to give the circumstances. in pretesting the questionnaire the recall of experiences had a traumatic effect on many of the respondents. our interviewers themselves, after having witnessed the effect, refused to ask the question of subsequent respondents. in the final version this question was eliminated. harm can be inflicted on the respondent when the investigator uses deception and it is discovered by the respondent during the course of the interview or subsequently. the respondent, in good faith, had agreed to the interview and then he feels that he has been made a fool of. the irony of the situation is that very often deception is used n hen it serves no purpose at all and could, in fact, impair the reliability of the survey in which it is used. i would like to cite a recent instance of this. several months ago a federal agency requested proposals from research companies to execute a survey to estimate the number of saltwater fish caught by sports fisherman during a 12 month period [ls]. a design which evidently had been used in the past was suggested. the 1 for a discussion of the implications of the term “statistical purpose,“ gee [ll]. plan was to conduct a large number of telephone interviews among households to determine in which of these households one or more family members did any saltwater fishing during the preceding 12 months. when these households were identified, mail questionnaires in the form of diaries would be sent to these families every two months, with the request to record all of the saltwater fish caught by all family members during the preceding two months. to obtain a sample of respondents for the original or first phase interview, the method of random digit dialing was suggested. a sample of telephone exchanges is selected, and then tables of four digit random numbers are used for dialing purposes. this method gives house holds with unlisted numbers a chance of getting into the sample. with this procedure only telephone numbers are known. yvt, to send out a mail questionnaire to families where someone fishes, it is neccssary to have the names and addresses. the method suggested was as follow. after determining whether there was fishing, the house hold composition, in terms of the ages and sexes of the members, would be obtained. the interviewer would then cite the number which was dialed and ask if it was correct. then the following sequence of questions was suggested. “thank you, now for verification purposes, what is the correct spelling of your last name?” (obtain full name and address). use only if necessary: “the national marine fisheries service may want to contact people by mail both those who fish and those who don’t fish. so, i’d appreciate this information.” not only does this procedure take a callous attitude toward people, but it is also bad research practice. investigation on mail questionnaire procedures has indicated that the response rate will be increased if potential respondents arc notified in advance that a mail questionnaire is coming. prior notification by postcard is effective in increasing response rates, but the increase is doubled if telephone prenotification is used. i have chosen examples to pinpoint the responsibilities of statisticians to people who are respondents in surveys. these are moral responsibilities. there is no policing or forcing to see that these are met. one can disregard the basic rights of respondents and still conduct a survey. the rationale would be to argue that a. any invasion of privacy that occurs through the conduct of a survey does not compare with the invasion caused by eavesdropping, concealed microphones, hidden cameras and other such devices ; b. the amount of harm that can be incurred by a respondent in a survey is minimal when compared with some of the experiments on human subjects that one hears about. after all, we are not administering lsd to unwitting soldiers , we are not giving a group of women placebos and telling them they have received birth control pills. while the harmful effects of unethical behavior on the part of a survey statistician may be minute in comparison with any of these other cases, the total damage could nevertheless be considerable. in the cases we hear about in the daily press or in other media, the individual damage is large but the number of people involved is small. a dramatic incident occurs. corrective measures are taken and the events tend to be forgotten. when ethical breaches occur in the survey area, there are thousands and thousands of persons involved. while the intensity of any harm may be small, the prevalence is high and the product of the two, the total harm, is sizable. while no dramatic expos6 will occur, the process can only lead to a slow erosion of the relationship between the survey statistician and potential respondents. the statistician’s responsibility to respondents, of course, extends beyond the conduct of the interview. in the process of collecting data, the respondent is aware that the information he supplies is linked with his name. he has consented to be interviewed with the feeling that after a certain point in the process of the survey, his name will not be required and somehow it will be discarded. in many surveys conducted by and for the federal government, the respondent is protected, in this respect, by current legislation. this legislation makes it a crime to divulge any individual information, and also provides for immunity of subpoena of the individual records. three federal laws arc involved. there are the census law, the public health service act, and the crime control act of 1973. except to verify the interview, to edit unusual responses where another call may be required, or to supplement the interview with ancillary data, the statistician has no need for the respondent’s identification. the previously mentioned statistician’s thinking in terms of impersonal abstraction, while detrimental in the collection process, now turns into an asset. as a general rule statisticians and others engaged in survey operations have respected the obligation of not revealing data concerning an individual. when surveys are conducted in the private sector, researchers have operated under codes of ethics by professional associations and trade groups involved in marketing and opinion research [7]. while these codes deal with the anonymity of records, they do not have any legal sanction. in the relatively few cases where there have been breaches of confidentiality, they have come about because of legal action. this occurred when sample survey findings were first introduced as legal evidence. there is surprisingly little objection because these surveys were based on samples. the principal objection was the contention that the conclusions and summary data obtained by the survey statistician were based on hearsay evidence. it was argued that before the survey findings could be accepted, the opposing attorneys had the right to subpoena respondents and question them as they would any other witnesses. under the threats (1) of having the survey declared inadmissible, and/or ( 2 ) bring held in contempt of court, i am proud to say that the survey statisticians adhered to their responsibilities and refused to release survey records relating to individual responses. through the diligence or perhaps the stubbornness of statisticians, the battle in this area seems to have been won. nowadays, when surveys are submitted, the hearsay rule is waived through prior agreement. interviewers may be subpoenaed but not respondents. this does not mean that everything is in fine shape. there now appears to be another threat to the maintenance of confidentiality. this is in the use of statistical records collected by or for the federal government. this threat arose in a peculiar way. in the late 1960s there was discussion centering around the use of a national data bank to be maintained by the federal government. this talk stimulated an examination of the concepts of the invasion of privacy and the main tenaner of the confidentiality of records, both within the context of the federal statistical system. the events of 1973 in the white house brought about a wave of hysteria concerning the sanctity of records of individuals that were obtained by the federal government for administrative purposes. these records could consist of income tax returns, social security records, applications for a television station license, and any other sort of record that an individual or a company would normally file for some special purpose. to protect the individual against the abuses that had come to light in 1973, three bills designed to protect the privacy of individuals were written and passed. these laws are the privacy act of 1974, the freedom of information act of 1974, and the educational amendment of 1974 that is, the amendment to section 436 of the general education provisions act, commonly referred to as the “buckley amendment.” in a brilliant analysis relating to their statistical implications have pointed out that these acts will make survey operations of the federal government more difficult. instead of protecting privacy, they may have the effect of licensing violations of the confidentiality of statistical records that previously have been protected. this has occurred be cause in these three acts there is no distinction between data collected for statistical purposes and data collected on individuals for administrative purposes. in addition, no recognition was taken of the fact that administrative records may be used for statistical purposes without any breaches of privacy or confidentiality. it is unfortunate that the statistical profession had little or nothing to do with the formulation of these acts. meeting the responsibilities how can we, then, as statisticians, face up to these responsibilities? some of them can be met on an individual level; others by means of a group effort; and still others through a combination of individual and group efforts. as individuals, an obvious approach is to behave in an ethical manner vis a vis the prospective or actual respondent. if we consider him and treat him as a human being, many of the public relation problems attendant to sample surveys will be eliminated. as individuals and as imaginative statisticians, we can meet some of our responsibilities through the development and use of techniques that guarantee the maintenance of privacy. the randomized response method used in the interviewing process is a device that assures that the true status of an individual with respect to this response to a particular question can never be determined. the technique of error inoculation can be used to protect data that have already been collected. this is a technique which adds a random number with a known preassigned distribution to the individual record. through this and other techniques, the exact value attributed to an individual will not be known. thus, the confidentiality of records is maintained whether the record was obtained through a survey or from some administrative file. electronic and mechanical devices can be used to insure anonymity of response. as far back as 1940, lazersfeld and stanton [9] developed the program analyzer for the purpose of keeping a continuous record of the likes and dislikes of a group listening to a radio program. each person in a studio audience was given a pair of control buttons which enabled him to record his likes by pressing the button in the right hand and his dislikes by pressing the button in the left hand. aggregate data are easily obtainable. while the responses of a person in a particular seat in the auditorium may be determined, after the seat has been vacated there is no way of determining how a particular person voted. new devices are being developed where through electronic means data can be collected. feedback devices on television sets will make it possible to have instantaneous counts fed into a central location so that the number of sets tuned to a particular channel can be determined. buttons can be put on television sets to indicate preferences to questions asked by an announcer. if the feedback is done through the use of trunk lines or by radio waves, then the individual responses will be of a transitory nature and the only permanent record will be the summary measure picked up at the central location. when an individual is working alone, he needs guidance through information provided by a group action. to this end our subsection on survey research methods received a grant from the national science foundation to examine survey methodology as it is now practiced and to deter mine what steps should be taken to improve the quality and usefulness of survey results. part of the investigation will deal with the relationship between the survey statistician and the public insofar as it may be a problem area. this study will provide indications for solutions and will lay the groundwork for a handbook on quality. this handbook will serve as a guide to individual practitioners. finally, statisticians can act together in group fashion when it comes to relations with legislative bodies. un fortunately, our profession has been lax in this respect. during the past few years the basis for a great deal of privacy legislation has been developed without the active participation of our association. when asked to provide help, we have reacted, but we have been slow in taking the initiative. as a result, legislation has been left in the hands of persons who do not understand the statistical method. in the past year our association has recognized its responsibilities and become more aggressive. two committees have been formed. the first is the committee of privacy and confidentiality. in forming this committee we took cognizance of the fact that some of the recent legislative acts and proposed legislation may have a substantially detrimental impact on statistical pro grams of the federal government and that the impact may be felt more generally. the committee is to review and evaluate the implications of these acts. the committee will also review current proposals in the office of management and budget concerning confidentiality and transfer of statistical records. it will bring these to the attention of the statistical profession and stimulate discussion of their implications among its members and other concerned groups. it will develop points of view and methods of implementation for any actions that should be taken as the basis for the asa to bring issues and problems to the attention of appropriate public and scientific groups. a second ad hoc committee is in the process of formation. this committee will be an advisory one to the house of representatives subcommittee on census and population. we are hoping that formal arrangement can be made, whereby our association can provide the sub committee with the technical expertise and advice with regard to its legislative responsibilities. while the specific charge to an ad hoc committee has not yet been established, one of our joint concerns is that safeguards against the invasion of privacy and breaches of confidentiality be maximized. when warren weaver made his presentation 20 years ago, it was at a time when science had recovered from the effects of the mccarthy era. this was a period when the omnipresence of science was being sold in many sectors of life. the public had the image of a scientific technical priesthood and weaver was concerned with a climate of fear that was emerging at that time. today, in the field of sample survey and census re search, we are becoming aware of another type of fear. this is the latent and instinctive human fear of being counted or enumerated. many of us who have taught statistics have pointed with pride at the antiquity of our subject by citing from the old testament the enumeration of fighting men taken at. however, there was another enumeration of fighting men which was conducted by job at the command of king david. it was reported that when the enumeration was completed, god was angry and divine wrath was visited on israel. there were three days of pestilence and 70,000 men died. to keep current its registers of the population, the romans conducted quinquennial censuses, whereby the members and property of each family were enumerated with respect to the family’s civil status and corresponding liabilities. whenever such a census was completed, a purification sacrifice took place. even as late as 1753 in the british house of commons, the fear was expressed that a numbering of the people would be followed by “some great public misfortune or epidemical distemper” [17]. some scholars have concluded that these cases expressed a lingering folk memory of a primitive taboo in modern times believe that we are civilized and do not need purification rites after an enumeration. people are not afraid of divine wrath or that an epidemic will occur after a census. the fear nowadays among some people we don’t know how many is that after an enumeration or interview, the information supplied will be indelibly inscribed in some central data bank, and that sometime in the future this information will be used against them. we have to allay these fears. if we do not, there is the danger that some demigod will attempt to make political capital out of this threat. in 1968 a member of congress taking this point of view was almost successful in getting legislation passed that could have restricted the scope of the 1970 census [4]. if we as statisticians regard the respondents in our surveys and censuses as coworkers and partners all attempting to accomplish a common task respondents by supplying information, statisticians by compiling then all of the responsibilities i have been discussing will fall into place.

the declaration of independence. during the course of this year many of the people in this nation have been involved in a search for a sense of history, purpose, and destiny for themselves and their institutions. it is also a worthwhile endeavor for a professional society to examine its past, its present, and its goals and objectives for the future. i can well imagine the surprise and amazement of the founding fathers of this nation if they were look in upon their product today some 200 years later. i also think the five men who met in this city in november, 1839, organize a statistical society would be very surprised at the present state of their offspring. i wonder if they would be pleased or disappointed. john fiske closes his account of the federal convention with a story of merit [2, p. 51. during the hot summer of 1787, for four months the delegates had been meeting in philadelphia. more than once it had seemed that their efforts would come to naught. differences in view points were often so marked that the convention threatened to break up in confusion. many felt that chaos was imminent. at long last came that day in september when the draft of the constitution was ready for the signature of the delegates. only three would not sign. the document was now ready to go to the continental congress for ratification. the members, it is said, sat as if awestruck at what had been accomplished. george washing ton, president of the convention, sat with bowed head. it was at this point that benjamin franklin made his prophetic comment. he was now past eighty years, with a life crowned with the wisdom only a wealth of sound experience could bring. it was he who had outlined the albany plan of union of 1754 to bring together the thirteen colonies. he had been a prime mover in the declaration of independence. he had just gone through the trying experience of the constitutional convention. on the * franklin a. graybill is professor, department of statistics, colorado state university, fort collins. co 80521. this article is the text of the presidential address delivered at the 136th annual meeting of the statistics1 association, august 22, 1976, boston, mass. bark of the president’s black armchair (etched in the wood) was a half sun with its gilded rays (peeking over the horizon). as washington stood up at the close of the meeting, franklin pointed to the chair with this observation, “as i have been sitting here all these weeks, i have often wondered whether yonder sun is rising or setting. but now i know that it is a rising sun!” i believe that it is a rising and not a setting sun for the statistical association and the statistical profession. i have given my address the title “what lies ahead?” to some this implies an inference, to others a prediction. i don’t, mean it in either sense, but i will state what i think have been some of our successes, and some of the things that i think we must consider for the near future. first i want to give a brief outline of some of our history and of stated objectives since i think it is imperative from time to time for a professional society evaluate its goals and accomplishments. we look at our recent history see what vie have done or should have done, since only in that perspective can we know what we can do or what we should do. a brief account of our history would begin in the rooms of the education society, number 15 cornhill, in this city of boston on november 27th, 1839 where five men met “for the purpose of considering the expediency of forming a statistical society.”’ on december 11 of the same year they met and adopted a constitution and officially organized the statistical society. article i1 of the constitution stated, “the objects of the society shall be to collect, preserve and diffuse statistical information in the different departments of human knowledge. two items of particular interest were contained in the official records of the first two meetings. the first item was in article vii of the constitution which stated, “the society shall meet annually in the city of boston on the first wednesday in february. i j the second item of particular interest was that one of the five founding members was a physician whose last name was fisher (prophetic perhaps). february 5, 1840 at the annual meeting it was voted change the name from the statistical society to the statistical association and apply to the legislature for an act of incorporation. “by an act approved february 5, 1841, the statistical 1 record of the first meeting of the statistical society association was incorporated by the legislature of massachusetts. thus the new association, full fledged and authorized by law, was ready for its work of preserving and diffusing statistical information” [6]. at the annual meeting in april, 1907 it was decided that there should be a presidential address at successive annual meetings. the first one was delivered by president carroll d. wright on january 17, 1908 in boston. the asa is now responsible, in whole or in part, for six major publications on a regular basis. the journal of the statistical association, the statistician, and amstat news are publications that are the entire responsibility of the asa. technometrics is jointly sponsored by the asa and the assoc. this year a new journal was begun, the journal of educational statistics, under the joint sponsorship of the educational research association and the asa. we expect this publication to be as successful as technometrics. this year we also started publication of the current index to statistics which i believe will be a major contribution to the statistical profession. in addition, we publish jointly, or alone, various abstracts and a directory. the asa was also responsible for starting biometrics the journal of the biometric society. in february, 1945, the biometrics bulletin was published by the asa under the masthead of the biometrics section of the statistical association. in march, 1947, the name was changed from biometrics bulletin to biometrics. the biometrics society (which is holding its meeting here in boston at the present time) was founded in september, 1947, and began at once using this (the biometrics) journal as their official publication channel. early in 1949 the biometrics society approached the asa concerning the possibility of transferring bimnetsics to the (biometric) society as an alternative to starting its own journal. terms proposed for the transfer were discussed through 1949 and approved in principle at the annual meetings of the bio metrics section in december and by the board of directors and council of the a s a in 1939 (the 100th year of our existence) we had slightly over 2,200 members. on january 1, 1961, we had 7,515 members and the annual dues were $12. on january 1, 1976, (15 years later) we had 12,011 members and the annual dues were $24. every year, except one, for the past 15 years our membership has increased. in 1975 our membership increased 6.7 percent, the largest percentage increase in the past 15 years. our net income over expense has been positive (more income than outgo) in all but three of the past 15 years. in 1975, the last complete fiscal year of operation, the dues per member were $20, while the cost per member of running the association was almost two times that amount. so, as the society grows, its members are demanding more. if you will examine the dues of similar societies, i believe you will find that ours are very reasonable. your board of directors is very aware of the financial problems that 2 biomckes, december 1950, p. 439. organizations of all kinds throughout the world have experienced during the past several years and has been constantly monitoring this aspect of operations. thanks to you the members, the board of directors, the central office, and the many members who have served on various committees, the statistical association is in very good financial shape. the association is composed of six sections and four subsections, which are organized by subject, and 60 chapters which are organized geographically. there are many, very active committees. the first section, established in 1938, was the biometrics section. the association has several official advisory groups to agencies of the united states government. the vitality and impact of the association will depend to a large extent upon the activity of the sections, the chapters, and the committees. on january 30,1970, the board of directors authorized the appointment of an ad hoc exploratory committee to prepare a proposal for a full scale study of future goals of asa. in may, 1970, the board approved and supplemented the committee’s recommendation which was that the board itself should conduct the study and issue the report. to assist the board, task forces were appointed to work under a steering committee’s guidance. the report was issued in july, 1971, and i invite you to examine it. i quote from that report : as background for this study we try to identify in highly compressed form the setting in which we see asa operating today, and the kind of world of statistics that the association must deal with in the relatively short future. certainly, to begin with, an outstanding characteristic is our diversity. it colors all we do as a discipline and imposes almost impossible demands on us as an association. today’s statisticians as a group are at one and the same time highly mathematical and empirical, theoretical and applied, general and subject oriented. their job attachments are to commerce, or industry, or teach ing, or government, the physical sciences or the social sciences. the statistician title alone hardly identifies what a given individual does because we vary so widely in interest and function. for many of us statistics is a primary profession, but for many also statistics is a second or even third skill. small wonder with these disparities there is difficulty in agreeing on just what we mean when we talk of statistics as a single discipline. there are, to be sure, some visible trends that may be reversing this growing tendency to diversity but their effect is still limited and may be offset by other developments. for example, we see an increasing emphasis on and common interest in data, including descriptive statistics on many different subjects and relating often to areas of public concern. this trend, largely toward interdisciplinary efforts, could well reverse or dampen some of the forces that have tended to fragment or compartmentalize asa since 1940 as we become increasingly concerned with special methodologies. if there is a single element that is new or deserves more emphasis it is the increasing need in today’s world to make more clearly understood our contribution as statisticians to the welfare of man. while this has been a matter of concern for a long time, it has been so only in a somewhat limited way. when the asa constitutional goal “to increase the contribution of statistics to human welfare” was adopted, it probably referred largely to the gathering of data rather than to its analysis and use. now, as a discipline we have become increasingly concerned with methodology, techniques, and applications over a much broader and often more complicated spectrum. as a result, we face the extremely difficult task of demonstrating to the world that statistical methods, techniques, and applications are an essential underpinning to analyzing problems in all areas of science and society, and provide useful ways of resolving real life problems that appear insoluble. accompanying the efforts to widen the application of statistics in areas of social concern, increased attention has been directed engage in research and publication is vast and largely unsung. but without you the association would cease to exist in its present form and its “contribution to human welfare” would diminish drastically. in the december, 1913 issue of jasa [4] in a paper entitled “our coming seventy fifth anniversary,” john koren stated : by many citizens to the burdens of the public in supplying in formation and of the questioning by the public of the value and validity of statistical results. professional statisticians will and should face increasingly stern responsibilities for strengthening the public trust in statistical inquiry. in addition to relating statistics to human welfare, the constitution calls for asa “to foster, in the broadest manner, statistics and its applications, (and) to promote unity and effectiveness of effort among all concerned with statistical problems.” all of these goals, too, are still valid, as are the generalized ways which the constitution identifies for carrying them out, namely: publications devoted to statistical methodology and its application, stimulating research, setting standards, promoting education, etc. what seems clear, however, is that viewing such goals and activities in the light of today’s world calls for something more than just publishing a specialized journal and conducting annual meetings of limited scope. we have, indeed, been moving away from this narrow interpretation, consciously or unconsciously, for many years.3 one of the overriding phrases in this document and in the constitution is “ increase the contribution of statistics to human welfare.” there are some (very, very few in number) who feel that a society should be a “learned” society only and its objectives are to publish a journal and hold meetings. i am happy to say that our society has taken the much broader view that we should be a “professional society” and hence we can “increase the contribution of statistics to human welfare.” while the publication of our technical journals is one of the most important tasks we perform, it is not the only one. of the 12,000 members of asa i doubt if more than 5 percent have published more than five papers in the journal of the statistical association or in technometrics. and there are many members who tell me that they do not read the journals. however, they belong to the association, they support the association, they give of time and money to the association apparently because they think it does in some way con tribute to human welfare. no one participates in all activities of the association, but we lend support even though we do not take part. i presume that most members make a living in some activity related to the subject of statistics. but i think that most of us hope that the profession that provides our livelihood also contributes something beyond that. the accomplishments of any society result from the free service to it by its members plus the additional assistance it is able to attract by judicious expenditure of its resources. in most scientific societies, by far the greatest input is free. the major output is the journal, the authorship of which is unremunerated effort by the members. publication costs are even paid by dues which represent the primary expenditure [5, p. 2051. so the contribution made by the members who do not a “a study of future goah of asa,” washington, d.c., july, 1971. “ i at a quarterly meeting of the association held about fifty years ago, john ward dean, its faithful recording secretary for many years, ‘‘drew the attention of the member to the fact that soon a quarter of a century would be completed since the first meeting was held for the organization of this association. he thought it desirable that the event should be noticed in some manner by the association. an address, in which the progress of statistical science during the last twenty five years and what this association had done in that time should be shown, would be an appropriate mode of observing the occasion. this address should be printed, and if so it would no doubt do much towards furthering the objects of the association” (from the minutes of the meeting). what cause for jubilation the founders of the statistical association had as they looked back upon its service during twenty five years is a story to be told in detail elsewhere. to the super critical of our age, their record of things done may seem brief enough; yet theirs was the fine distinction of having kindled and kept alive a keen and discriminating interest in statistical work in the days of its infancy in the united states. at that time to have conceived of statistical inquiry as a science, always spelling it with a capital s, betokened courage and rare confidence in the future. the statistical profession can play a vital role in our society ; it cannot only help enlarge the technology, it can help evaluate technology’s impact on our lives. dr. brzezinski, professor of government at columbia university, in an article for the los angeles times [l] stated, ”it is a fact that our society is becoming saturated with data and information. the problem no longer is what we need to know but how interpret the data with which we are submerged almost daily.” and a group who spent several decades of research in employment has determined that “the world’s work can be described by three major functions work with people, work with things, and work with data’’ [3, p. 71. we are often told how rapidly knowledge or information is increasing. anyone who regards academic information as the backbone of education might do well to ponder the medical student’s dilemma, “while a general practitioner learns less and less about more and more, until he eventually knows nothing about every thing, the specialist learns more and more about less and less until he eventually knows everything about nothing” [3, p. 41. can society move forward in the face of this information and data overload? i am optimistic (or perhaps naive) enough to believe that the statistical profession can make and has made a “contribution to human welfare,” and as man collects the mountains of information, an appropriate share of his resources must be de voted to abstracting and distilling the important ingredients from this information and to learning how to use the storehouse of knowledge for the benefit of the human race. it is perhaps a time worn cliche that the statistical association’s greatest treasure is not its publications, it is not its financial resources, it is not its chapters or sections or annual meetings, but it is to be found in the rich diversity and commitment of its members. it is you who will chart our course and propel us down it. what i am trying to say is that our main strength is the diversity of our interests, our backgrounds, our training, and our work. i have no hard data to support my claim but my observations lead me to conclude that more people hold jobs that are classified directly or indirectly as “statisticians” who received no degree from a department of statistics than who have a degree from a statistics department. i also believe that in our institutions of higher education most students who take courses that can be classified as “statistics courses” are taught by professors who are not in departments of statistics and who do not have degrees in statistics. i don’t mean to imply that this state of affairs is all bad. however, i believe it is far from optimal unless there is adequate communication between the professional statisticians and those whose commitment to statistics is secondary. in many respects the blame for this situation must be placed on the shoulders of the statisticians, for in many cases we have been so involved with our own research that we have not taken the time to promote the service courses to fill the needs of other disciplines. on the other hand, part of the blame must rest on the shoulders of the professors in the various disciplines for their parochial attitude towards their students. i believe, however, that the principal deficiency in the arrangement is the lack of communication between the professional statisticians and the nonprofessional statisticians who must use statistics in their work. the responsibility for improving the situation is ours and the task is not an easy one. the lack of communication can be even more serious among other groups who utilize statistics : the theorists and the data analysts, those in industry and those in government (local, state, and federal), those in higher education and those in industry and government, those whose principal job is statistics and those who use statistics as a peripheral tool, those whose main interest is one area such as biometrics and those whose main interest is another area such as computing or physical and engineering sciences. it is perhaps inevitable that interests become more diverse and specialized as the profession grows and develops. one of the principal goals of our association, and one that we must all work towards, is the goal of utilizing the diversity of the members of our profession to its advantage. while the many centers of statistical activity by their objectives and functions have different needs, we must appreciate that each must utilize statistics in its own fashion because of its requirements. thus cooperation, understanding, and communication is important if the science of statistics is to have the full impact on society’s problems as it should have. so “what lies ahead?” one could make a prediction about what theories and methodologies the next generation of statisticians will be using. this is a subject be discussed elsewhere. i am interested in a different aspect of what lies ahead of us. i want to relate to you just a few of the topics that have been brought to my attention since i have been president. some of these have been discussed only briefly, some are being implemented, some will be forgotten, some will contribute majorly to our profession. these are topics to which every member can give help and input. a brief list of these would include the following : 1. the asa should do more to promote statistics on the inter national scene. 2. the asa should have a grievance policy available for its members who have pressure applied by a person or group to modify statistical results for the advantage of the group. 3. there should be a national accrediting policy for institutions that give academic degrees in statistics. there should be a national certification for practicing statisticians. 4. the asa should have an ethical standard by which to judge members who falsify data for their own benefit. 5. the asa should seek to have much greater input into the methods of data collection and interpretation for the purpose of.legislation. 6. the asa should have information available for its members about job opportunities, salaries, age distribution, etc. 7. the asa should do much more to encourage women and minorities to enter the profession. 8. the asa should set guidelines on how statistics can be used in court cases. 9. the asa should address the problem of the need of government and industry to obtain information from the public and at the same time protect the privacy of the individual. 10. the asa must assume a strong leadership in the field of continuing education for its members. 11. the asa should find ways to help members of the executive and legislative branches of government understand how statistics can be used to give them information on which to make and evaluate public policy; one way is perhaps by becoming a stronger force in the national academy of sciences. 12. the asa should encourage the development of more under graduate programs in statistics. 13. the asa must do a better job of

rising sun, and as we as a people become more involved in technology, in social programs, in all the myriad of things that contribute to civilization as we know it and shape it, statistics will play a

not at all. those activities gave birth and name to our field and they still occupy central and vital areas. but in those areas also it it is the recognition of the effects of chance, of variability, of fluctuations, that distinguishes the work of statisticians from the neighboring fields of accounting, bookkeeping, and inventory taking. controversy also exists about the sources of chance effects. we may agree about the prevalence of errors of sampling and of measurements, and also about errors due to our current ignorance of disturbing factors. however, many of us, but not all, also postulate a fundamental * lealie kish is professor of sociology, research scientist, and program director at the institute for social research, the university of michigan, ann arbor, mi 48106. this article is the text of the presidential address delivered at the 137th annual meeting of the statistical association, august 16, 1977, chicago. source of indeterminacy that underlies all empirical work, and a basic role for such indeterminacy in our outlook, models, and designs. furthermore, the remedies i suggest for closing the gaping wound between academic mathematical statisticians and practicing empirical statisticians are bound to be especially controversial. statistics contrasted with other sciences statistics is a peculiar kind of enterprise of contradictory character because it is at the same time so special and so general. statistics exists only at the interfaces of chance and empirical data. but it exists at every such interface, which i propose to be both necessary and sufficient for an activity to be properly called statistics. it has a special and proscribed function whenever and wherever empirical data are treated ; in scientific research of any kind ; in government, commerce, industry, and agriculture ; in medicine, education, sports, and insurance; and so on for every human activity and every discipline. this widely spread yet specialized character differs from other disciplines, which tend to cover in depth all aspects of their special domains. thus statistics differs fundamentally from other sciences, the data of other scientists come chiefly from their own disciplines though they may also take side trips into other fields. in stark contrast, statisticians have no fields of their own from which to harvest their data. statisticians get all their data from other fields, and from all other fields, wherever data are gathered. because we have no field of data of our own we cannot work without others, but they also cannot do without us or not very well, or for very long. ours is a symbiotic way of life, a marginal and hyphenated existence. we resemble the professional harvesters of wheat and grains on our great plains, who own no fields of their own, but harvest field after field, in state after state, and lead a useful, rewarding, and interesting life as we do. instead of the word chance we could use probability, except that today i would rather avoid the theological controversies surrounding that word. yet we can agree that statistics does not claim to deal with all kinds of uncertainties. not, for example, with the uncertain aspects of unique historical events such as brought on the , french, russian, mexican, or chinese revolutions. (nor, for a more humble example, with the uncertain events that brought me to this platform tonight.) statistics deals with chance effects in empirical data concerned with classes of events, not single historical events ; it treats numerical data from classes, from populations (kendall 1948). i also believe that we should deal chiefly with large classes of many events, and not with classes of size 2, 3, or 6. my aims are entirely pragmatic: to describe what we statisticians do in our practice, in our teaching, in our writing and what we should be doing; also what our association tries to encompass, and in what directions we should plan to move. the descriptions and plans are not simple because statistics is such a diffuse enterprise. at one end it has vital roots in abstract mathematical theories of probability and stochastic processes ; it shades without definable boundaries into several profound areas within mathematics proper. at the other, it branches into procedures for collecting and analyzing empirical data of all kinds; thus it gets embedded in the methods and interpretations of all substantive fields of measurement. statistics and statisticians must remain in touch with both ends, but they can neither encompass nor reside exclusively in either end. without data we are within the deductive arena of mathematical probability. without chance effects we are in one of the many areas where mankind has learned to observe, measure, and count. all types of counting, all processes of observation, collection, tabulation, and analysis of data are subject to variability, to errors, and to mistakes. but statistics does not necessarily include all kinds of counting, such as those found in accounting, banking, voting, or scoring in sports. when dealing with measurements, experts in the specific sub stantive fields concern themselves with refining instruments, and with eliminating mistakes and cheating. statisticians also get involved in those efforts, but the statistician brings a different and special view to the study of errors of observation : an explicit recognition of chance effects, a probabilistic view and treatment of them, and especially the incorporation of that view into the research design and the interpretation of observations. note then that to err is human, to forgive divine but to include errors in your design is statistical. in any scientific enterprise one can distinguish a hierarchy of four problems and decisions. first comes the choice of variables to consider, second the design of the model for relations between the variables. these two decisions belong to the scientist or expert in the substantive field. third comes the estimation of parameters, and fourth the assessment and analysis of the variability of errors of those estimates. for these latter two stages statisticians are needed, and they must be either bought or borrowed. (otherwise, the role is taken by the scientist ; and he may perform it well, but he may not.) consider, for example, the model d = (3)gtzfor the distance covered in t seconds by an object falling freely to the earth’s surface. the constants 3 and 2 come from the physicist’s model, but the statistician gets involved in designs for measuring d, t,, and especially g, the gravity parameter. furthermore, to measure the distribution of g may pose a formidable challenge for the sample design, requiring both a background in the relevant variables and foresight about future uses of the model. the situation is similar in more complex models, whether physical, biological, or social. consider, for example, the highly controversial separation of an i& test into components for genetic heritability, environment, situational factors like age and culture, inter actions, and error terms. i maintain that the basic difference between the social sciences and the “exact sciences” lies not in the magnitudes of the error terms, but in the multivariate nature inherent in the models. in the social sciences, most models must be multivariate because disturbing variables cannot be excluded as the physicist excludes air resistance and wind from his freely falling body. statistics and philosophy we may agree then that statistics, in both its theory and its practice, plays important roles in many or in most human activities. we generally also agree that it requires as much learning, experience, and intelligence as any other profession. still, is it an interesting and noble occupation? is it an exciting activity for a young person and is it dignified for a mature person? would you want your daughter to become a statistician? or your son to marry one? it may seem like a humble task to hunt for and measure errors while the search for the main patterns and variables belongs to other scientists. i believe and shall argue that statistics is the most mature of the sciences. learning to live with the inevitable uncertainties of chance effects and to include them in our patterns, plans, designs, assessments, and inferences is among the latest and most mature products of the human mind. we shall note that the late arrival of statistics among the sciences has important consequences for its position among university departments and for its problems today. in all her (his) endeavors the statistician cannot avoid the basic philosophical problem of empirical science : to make inferences from limited sets of empirical data to large finite populations and to infinite superpopulations of random variables induced by causal systems. survey samplers, in particular, cannot avoid the basic questions posed by david hume, then by karl popper (1959) and by wesley salmon (1967). the fundamental ideas of statisticians like fisher, neyman, and savage are not only mathematical but profoundly philosophical. the converse is also true: in the current philosophy of science you find fundamental ideas coming from statisticians and from the theory of statistics. a closer link between the disciplines of statistics and the philosophy of science, at least in joint seminars, would be stimulating to both. the diverse schools of inference frequentist, fiducial, bayesian, likelihood, and others still to come may be viewed as valiant efforts to capture within a mathematical framework the “hume an” problem of inference from variable empirical sample data to universal statements. the powerful emergence of the new ideas may be seen in darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selec tion, and in the later developments of the theory. con sider genetics from mendel to morgan and to watson. scardovi (1976, p. 35) writes: mendel’s was the first explicit indeterministic paradigm in the history of science, [and in 18661 was thirty years ahead of the philosophy and science of his time. the complete lack of recognition accorded him by his contemporaries can thus be explained. mendel also surprises us with his statistical insight : he was capable of seeing in his numerical data random oscillations about a limiting value, and thus was able to extract the ideal proportion toward which the outcomes in the combined heredity of several traits tend. all biological diversity of species and of individuals may now be viewed as the results of many throws of the dna dice interacting with the environment. monod (1971, p. 118) writes: even today a good many distinguished minds seem unable to accept or even understand that from a source of noise natural selection alone and unaided could have drawn all the music of the biosphere. in effect natural selection operates upon the products of chance and can feed nowhere else; but it operates in a domain of very demanding conditions, and from this domain chance is barred. it is not to chance but to these conditions that evolution owes its generally progressive course, its successive conquests, and the impression it gives of a smooth and steady unfolding. synthesis of chance and necessity statistics is ubiquitous because events everywhere involve chance factors. all nature and all human activities resemble games like bridge, baseball, football, or tennis in combining chance with skill or causal factors. bjorn borg said on winning at wimbledon in 1977, “i think i am number 1 for the moment.” the structure and language of sports show people’s widespread intuitive knowledge of combining chance with skill. in football the top team must win about 8 of 10 games, and we speak of “upsets.” i liked the sophistication of a simple headline one friday in our michigan daily: “upset unlikely.” but in baseball games we see no “upsets,” and winners average perhaps 60 percent of about 160 games. examples abound in sports and games of sophisticated designs for combining chance with skill. yet statistical views are still emerging in new fields, when mature minds discover the effects of chance. those views come late, because (as monod said) “minds are unable to accept or even understand” the joint roles, in stead of mutually exclusive roles, for pure chance and for natural laws. einstein, the wisest mind of our century, is quoted (hoffman 1972, p. 193) as saying, “god does not play dice with the universe.” yet the einstein bose statistics define a basic game of chance for elementary particles. the delays in the synthesis of chance effects with causal systems present a paradox whose examination is fruitful for us. primitive man’s fascination with chance, fate, and fortune was early and widespread. he was first filled with wonder and awe of hidden powers, magic, miracles, and ad hoc explanations. only after discovering rules for connecting cause and effect, and formulating natural laws, did he learn to counterpose chance effects to explain deviations from the rules. much later came the combined view of causal laws with chance effects. “at the end of the seventeenth century the philosophical studies of cause and chance began to move close together,’’ and were developed in sciences like astronomy and demography in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. this development had an important impact on the theory of chance itself. previously chance was a nuisance, at least for those who wished to foresee and control the future. man now began to use it for other purposes, to bring it under control, to measure its effect, and to make due allowance for it. (kendall 1968.) a similar development of the idea of chance in children the child does not distinguish the possible from the necessary. during the first period there is no differentiation between what is deducible and what is not because the intuitive anticipation remains halfway between operation and chance itself. during the second period [after seven years] there is differentiation and hence an antithesis between chance and operations, chance defines the unpredictable. in the course of stage i11 [after eleven years], on the contrary, there is a synthesis between chance and operations, thus the complementary roles of chance and necessity appear basic and ubiquitous. that the discoveries of the diverse syntheses occur late to mature minds has several consequences. first, i believe that this vital outlook should belong to the philosophical, humanistic, and moral heritage of all scientists, and further of all citizens; also i believe that statisticians have natural responsibilities for teaching it. consider the broad implications of several recent discoveries about the role of chance: the genetics of individual health, intelligence, and behavior; the statistics of population genetics (for which fisher has been called the foremost biologist of our century) ; the occurrence of cancer ; the lengths of our lives. appreciating the pervasiveness of chance should help us cope better with diverse aspects of life. about success in affairs, in business, even in science, we may say: “fortune favors the prepared mind.” the winners of millions of dollars or of nobel prizes tend to accent the prepared mind, the losers emphasize fortune. this tendency for biased judgment, between winners and losers, is also found in national surveys of attitudes (and these self protective biases may be psychologically healthy). the tragic biblical job might have been happier and wiser if he knew that his plagues were due to chance. the triumphs or the problems of your children may be due to chance, not only to your behavior despite what freud may say; a statistical view may protect parents against false pride or against guilt and despair. but we are not mere helpless puppets of chance, and we can improve our chances for example, by quitting smoking, with regular exercise, and by losing weight. recognition of the inter was investigated in 1951 by piaget (1975). at first play of chance with discernible causes may yet lead us to a better way of life and to a better moral philosophy. somebody may even start a new religion of statisticology ! recent developments of new fields a second consequence of the late recognition of chance effects may be found in recknt discoveries of new fields for statistics. within the past two generations, field after field has been laid open with the statistical recognition or introduction of chance effects. for example : fisher with randomized experimental designs ; neyman with randomized designs for complex samples ; shewhart with statistical control for quality of products ; stochastic analysis for many fields ; time series and spectral analysis ; monte carlo simulation ; response surface analysis ; and so on. there will be still more as our era of statistical discoveries continues. within the major fields many new techniques were also developed. in survey sampling, for example : multiphase sampling, interpenetrating samples, jackknifes, balanced repeated replications, controlled selection, measurements of interviewer variance, randomized response techniques, randomization for confidentiality, etc. each of these techniques uses chance and randomization to tackle some problem in application. in addition, new procedures are designed as survey sampling penetrates new fields such as anthropology, archeology, and geology. i view the entire field of survey sampling as another synthesis of chance and structural effects. it is a set of strategies for representing actual populations of variables, which are ill defined mixtures of the two components. instead of assuming a well mixed urn of random variables, the sampler designs a complex randomized design over the frame population, and controls the chance effects through stages of randomized operations of selection. many other problems and fields still remain to be conquered with new statistical techniques and theories to capture and to tame the wild errors of chance. for ex ample, modern epidemiology has created many new ideas ; mcneill (1976) used those ideas to write a new interpretation of world history! statistics in universities today but even if we grant broad importance to it, does the discipline of statistics need autonomy? does statistics need separate departments in our universities? the question is being asked by financially pressed universities, which notice that students elect most of their statistics courses outside the statistics departments. with one foot in mathematics, a second in computing, a third in philosophy, and seventeen more in other departments, do we have a leg to stand on? i say yes but. yes enthusiastically, because a statistician trained in the theory and in the applications of, for example, survey sampling and experimental design, can design better surveys and experiments in just about any field of application than either a mathematical statistician or an expert within his (her) own field. the knowledge and the approach of the statistician are reason ably portable from field to field. but i also believe that departments of statistics must change drastically from their present narcissistic concentration on abstract theory. research and teaching, in many departments, have become divorced from applications, from empirical data, from the real world. this centripetal academic disease is chronic and contagious, and is also common in other disciplines and in other countries (although british statistical tradition seems less affected even today). typically the teaching of statistics in universities is based on the assumption that graduates with good theoretical backgrounds can readily learn applications afterwards, while ‘‘on the job.” but “on the job training” for unprepared statisticians can be very expensive both to graduates and to their clients and employers. teaching applications within an academic setting may be more difficult than teaching theory, but with care it can be provided, and ultimately it should be much cheaper than the total costs of “sink or swim on the job” for unprepared graduates. would you accept a physician or surgeon with only theoretical training? at the same time, i also believe universities should offer more theoretical statistics as continued education for statisticians and for others who practice statistics without statistical degrees. the practitioners working on applied problems will bring their own experiences, views, and needs to their studies of theory. to satisfy their needs, to answer their questions, and to help solve their problems should also provide the stimulation that academic departments of statistics need. i believe those efforts hold great promise for universities. the history of our discipline exhibits significant para doxes in autonomy. our association was founded in 1839, only the second national scientific body after the philosophical society (wallis 1966). yet more than 100 years passed before the first department of statistics was established in a university. in the 30 years since then more than 100 departments have mushroomed. the late arrival of this mature science was not accidental; after galton, pearson, and fisher it was bound to come. but the portentous accident was the coincidence of its arrival with the historically unique explosion of universities, which just now ended. consequently our academic statisticians have been nurtured in a fantasy land that they mistook for normalcy. departments concentrated on turning out academic ph.d.’s, and imported others to fill the hungry pipelines. [o$e had the curious situation where the highest objective of the teacher of statistics was to produce a student who would be another teacher of statistics. it was thus possible for successive generations of teachers to be produced with no practical knowl edge of the subject whatever. (box 1976.) but this geometric explosion had to end, and statistics departments must now reform their teaching strategies accordingly. i doubt that the future lies in concentrating exclusively on mathematics and theory, and having students find their own way to applied statistics in other departments. some biostatistics departments have done remarkably well in teaching applied statistics to students in all fields, but this service function interferes with their primary responsibilities to the biomedical sciences. also the mislabeling is a hindrance to students and graduates in other fields. reformation must come and it will probably take diverse forms. one solution consists of one large department having many joint appointments with departments of application, of mathematics, and of computing. in one university i visited, a good and happy department consists entirely of joint appointments. many statistics departments should change, i propose, from their primary concentration on self contained and self perpetuating theoretical ph.d. degree programs. in stead they should develop strong master’s level programs in applied statistics, designed first for statisticians in government, industry, and other applications, and second as vital components of ph.d. programs in other fields. if a statistics department insists on confining itself to mathematical statistics, then a decent regard for truth to its clients, the students, demands that it relabel itself accordingly. better theory and methods in statsticl off ices in asking for changes both in universities and in work situations i agree with bjerve’s (1975) presidential address to the isi, and his “worries about the wide gap existing between official statisticians and academic statisticians. professionally, these two groups seem to be living in two different worlds without communication in between.” the time has come for better integration of theory with application. theory should improve the quality and efficiency of applied work. simultaneously, applications must be the testing ground for statistical theory and methods, and must provide the motivation for further advances. several paths toward integration are possible. 1. programs of continued education should be encouraged. they can transmit new techniques and also satisfy needs discovered on the job by practitioners. beyond the traditional devices such as books, journals, and sessions at annual meetings, we need more special and short courses both at universities and elsewhere (note the very successful short courses at our asa meetings). more short courses, seminars, workshops, and meetings should also be organized within the offices themselves. (“offices” refer to places in government, industry, hospitals, etc. where applied statistics are being performed.) 2. consultations of practitioners with academic experts on current problems can be beneficial and stimulating to both parties. it seems to me that the offices could profit ably increase those contacts and the sizes of their consulting budgets. incidentally, such consultations may help to redress the imbalance between giant organizations that have their own specialists and small ones with none. 3. more statisticians strong in theory and methods are needed in offices. these positions, when created, should be filled better and more easily in the coming job market than in the past especially if universities prepare their graduates for practical work. in many cases part time positions for academics, or visiting or rotating positions for one or two years, may be preferable for both parties. all these situations exist, but they are underutilized be cause they run against the rigid structural habits both of offices and of academia. 4. more internships for students are badly needed and can greatly benefit all three parties (students, universities, and offices) and society. because of conflicting drives of the three parties, the programs need care, skill, and empathy and finances. but the outlook for the coming years is more propitious than in the past. 5. better recognition is also needed for the status and roles of statistical methodologists. in too many offices the ladder of promotion takes good statisticians out of technical positions into largely administrative roles. our association and publications what should our association do to close the great gap, to better serve our discipline and all statisticians? i throw this question back to you. write to our board, t ry reforms in our sections, chapters, and committees. i note only that the coming years are propitious for bringing our mathematical colleagues back into the association. but our main efforts should be directed to bringing in all hyphenated statisticians from other fields who have strayed from our fold. their presence and activities are needed for vigorous development in our field and in our association. our sections, chapters, and committees must help. a central role in this unifying task must be played by our publications. we are proud of our publications, but here again i appeal to you to help restore a better balance toward applications. our editors and the publications committee are working toward those aims, but we need your help. we face several major obstacles : 1. we all respect mathematics because we each have had some, but we also fear mathematicians. i find that the more mathematics one has, the more one craves (an insatiable desire in accord with psychological reward systems). statistical publications have been flooded with mathematical virtuosity, and that flood has been permitted to impede statistical creativity. 2. we must work against a common but false double equality whereby methods are equated with theory and then theory with mathematics. both equalities are only partly true and misleading and harmful. statistical theory needs strong philosophical foundations and orientation toward empirical data. and methods are valuable only insofar as they are applicable. i would strongly prefer that methodological contributions be actually applied to empirical data to prove (probe, test) them. that, i believe, was karl pearson’s demand as editor of biometrika. 3. academicians have more time, experience, and motivation to write, edit, and referee than most practitioners. they deserve our gratitude for performing very well on the whole a difficult task and a necessary evil. but papers on applications and methods too often suffer from lack of understanding by the referees. the im balance can be redressed with more help for, and more pressure on, our publications from our practitioners. what can we do about the gaping chasm between the statistics departments and statistics in the applied world? the very words statistics and statisticians seem to have entirely different meanings in the two worlds. some friends say that it is too late and hopeless to try to reunite the two. some favor surrendering the very name statistics in universities, and starting out fresh in new departments with names like “data analysis” or “statistical computing.’’ others even dare to deprive the practicing, applied statistician of the name of statistics and to appropriate it exclusively for their own academic mathematical pursuits. i disagree with those pessimists. iago may be talking of statisticians when he says to othello: who steals my purse steals trash; but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes me poor indeed. we need the good name of statistics for our field and our association, and we need it to unite the efforts of theoretical and applied statisticians. there is a common chain that links mathematical probability with statistical theory, then with our methods, and these with our applications. to weaken or break that chain anywhere is harmful to all. but i shall not end on a pessimistic note. as a statistician i am an optimist, with a statistical definition of the species: “an optimist is a person who thinks the future is uncertain.” ",290,17.2137931034483,5.18449519230769,0.296875,4992,1482,16.4968168103448,11.4968168103448,47,0.742689063157936,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1978.10479990"

(i don't think any of you would have understood it anyway.) i have had to look for an alternative. i toyed for some time with the title, ""whither statistics?,"" subtitled ""perhaps we shouldn't start from here,"" but in the end abandoned that too. eventually it struck me that many of the issues that we face as members of the statistical association are really not very different from those we face as ordinary human beings. this is what my talk is about. the best is often not very good some of us have had a preoccupation with optimal or best procedures. but the best, of course, is not necessarily very good. for instance, to bring in the aspect of everyday life, if ever i had to decide between cutting my throat with a razor blade or with a rusty nail, i suppose i would choose the razor blade. but, although not strictly relevant to the problem as posed, one question that might cross my mind would be, ""have i considered all my options?"" a principle that is being given more attention these days is that of ""robustification."" here one doesn't attempt to guarantee that things will be optimal over some tractable, but perhaps very narrow, set of circumstances. instead one tries to ensure that they will be fairly good over a wide range of possibilities likely to happen in practice. look at the human hand, for example. i doubt if there is any single thing that it does that could not be done better by some special instrument, but it is very good at doing a very large number of things that come up in facing the world as it actually is. another way to say this is that there is really nothing wrong with optimization per se, but that we ought to try to optimize over that distribution of circumstances which the world really presents to us. the mistake is choosing the best over too narrow a set of alternatives, suboptimization. it is sometimes argued that by doing simplified exercises, we can at least obtain useful pointers. however, i feel that such pointers are very likely to indicate the wrong direction, as might be true in the case of the razor blade and the rusty nail. what is the real world like? the difficulty in taking the wider robustification approach is that we cannot expect to get good results unless we are really prepared to engage in the hazardous undertaking of finding out what the world is really like. it requires us, as statisticians, to have some knowledge of reality. i believe we do have members, we may have asa fellows, possibly we have even had asa presidents who really do not care what the world is really like. some years ago a friend of mine told me about his daughter who was then at oxford university. she was a very bright girl, but she got interested in politics (it was in the 1960s); she got behind in her studies, and the time of graduation was approaching. you may know that in the english system, there are many different grades of bachelor's degree. the young lady started to worry: was she going to get a ""pass"" degree (which is almost like the university spitting at you), or was it to be a third class, lower second class, upper second class, or a first class honours degree? she decided to ask her tutor about it. finding him buried somewhere in the dust of one of the oxford colleges, she eventually got around to asking him the delicate question, ""would it matter in the outside world if i didn't get a very good degree?"" he looked very startled and said, ""outside world? what do i know about the outside world?"" when the statistician looks at the outside world, he cannot, for example, rely on finding errors that are independently and identically distributed in approximately normal distributions. in particular, most economic and business data are collected serially and can be expected, therefore, to be heavily serially dependent. so is much of the data collected from the automatic instruments which are becoming so common in laboratories these days. analysis of such data, using procedures such as standard regression analysis which assume independence, can lead to gross error. furthermore, the possibility of contamination of the error distribution by outliers is always present and has recently received much attention. more generally, real data sets, especially if they are long, usually show inhomogeneity in the mean, the variance, or both, and it is not always possible to randomize. to find out what the world is really like, we must spend more time looking for ourselves at real sets of data. for example, david cox says that deviations from normality often occur in the direction of light tailed distributions as well as heavy tailed ones. let us discover if he's right. if he is, it could seriously affect some proposed robust methods. in order to better confront the realities of the outside world, some have urged us to abandon classical methods of estimation, such as employ likelihood and bayes' theorem, and resort to a new empiricism for each problem that arises, and for each author that writes about it. i think that notion is wrong headed. the imperfection, of course, lies not with the estimation method, but with the model that we put into it. for example, it is true that the sample average, which is the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean on standard normal assumptions, could be a very poor estimate if we believed that the data were generated by a contaminated normal distribution. nevertheless, if our model took account, not of what we did not believe, but rather of what we did believe, we could obtain excellent estimates by standard methods. the great advantage of the model based over the ad hoc approach, it seems to me, is that at any given time we know what we are doing. models, of course, are never true, but fortunately it is only necessary that they be useful. for this it is usually needful only that they not be grossly wrong. i think rather simple modifications of our present models will prove adequate to take account of most realities of the outside world. the difficulties of computation which would have been a barrier in the past need not deter us now. choosing the ""best"" doesn't make sense with options that are not alternatives another difficulty with optima is a tendency to want to choose the best one of a set of items that are not really alternatives. the relevant question then is not, ""which is best?,"" but ""do these different entities have a role, and if so, what is it?"" for example, it turns out that it is much better to have two sexes than one and this not merely for hedonistic reasons. again, if one mentions bayesian analysis and sampling theory analysis in the same breath, one not only hears the question, ""which is best?,"" but also the question, ""which is right?,"" and religious passions are quickly aroused. yet, to my mind bayes theory and sampling theory are not alternatives at all. it is widely recognized that the advancement of learning does not proceed by conjecture alone, nor by observation alone, but by an iteration involving both. certainly, scientific investigation proceeds by such iteration. examination of empirical data inspires a tentative explanation which, when further exposed to reality, may lead to its modification. this modified explanation is again put in jeopardy by further exposure to reality, and so on, in a continued alternation between induction and deduction. i am continually surprised that statisticians, even good ones, still seem to ignore this iterative aspect of investigation and talk as if the movement from an initial (perhaps ill posed) question, to design, to data collection, to analysis of the data, to ""the answer"" were a one shot affair. the wise investigator expends his effort not in one grand design (necessarily conceived at a time when he knows least about unfolding reality), but in a series of smaller designs, analyzing, modifying, and getting new ideas as he goes. this iterative aspect of research has a profound influence on almost everything the investigator and the statistician do, and it has been the source of much misunderstanding. just as the rules that govern mathematical iteration are very different from those that govern solutions in closed form, so the rules that ought to apply to the statistics of most real scientific investigations are different, broader, and vaguer than those that might apply to a single decision or to a single test of hypothesis. now, since scientific advance, to which all statisticians must accommodate, takes place by the alternation of two different kinds of reasoning, we would expect also that two different kinds of inferential process would be required to put it into effect. the first, used in estimating parameters from data conditional on the truth of some tentative model, is appropriately called estimation. the second, used in checking whether, in the light of the data, any model of the kind proposed is plausible, has been aptly named by cuthbert daniel criticism. while estimation should, i believe, employ bayes' theorem, or (for the fainthearted) likelihood, criticism needs a different approach. in practice, it is often best done in a rather informal way by examination of residuals or other suitable functions of the data. however, when it is done formally, using tests of goodness of fit, it must, i think, employ sampling theory for its justification. bayes and likelihood inferences are necessarily conditional and, therefore, should not be used alone for the same reason that the statement, ""if the moon was made of green cheese, it would be a great place for mice,"" should not tempt a. mouse to hang around cape kennedy. inappropriate division of an entity while we can make a mistake by looking for one answer when we should be looking for two or more, we can make another mistake by dividing an entity inappropriately. you will recall the story of solomon, who determined the true mother of a child of disputed parentage by offering to cut it in two. one slicing of our subject which i think can be harmful is that into applied statistics and theoretical statistics. i hear people saying things like, ""of course i'm a theoretical statistician myself, but i agree there should be some applied statisticians and there should even be applied statistics departments; in fact, some of my best friends are applied statisticians."" now, in my opinion, that isn't any good, because, if you imagine the theoretical statisticians distributed about a point on the right of a scale and the applied statisticians distributed about a point on the left, you will end up with a bimodal distribution with low density in the center. now the people most needed are, in my opinion, those in the middle, and perhaps that's why they seem to be in such short supply. if, alternatively, we aimed at a central target, then we might achieve a single unimodal distribution. this would still, of course, allow diversity. we would have some highly theoretical people in one tail and some highly applied people in the other. but the majority, while having proper theoretical training, might also possess ability and experience in applying what they knew to the solution of scientific problems. training of statisticians this suggests the question of how statisticians should be trained. it's fairly easy to see how we should not train them. i will make an analogy with swimming. swimming could be taught by lecturing the student swimmers in the classroom three times a week on the various kinds of strokes and the principles of buoyancy and so forth. some might believe that on completing such a course of study, the graduates would all eagerly run down to the pool, jump in, and swim at once. but i think it's much more likely that they would want to stay in the classroom to teach a fresh lot of students all that they had learned. let me mention another distinction which is now needed, and which threatens to become an unnecessary and harmful slicing. statistical practitioners have known for a long time that, prior to using the methods that most textbooks emphasize, there is a very important and largely neglected' phase of activity which fisher called specification and which has also been called model identification. this involves informal techniques of analysis of data, many of them graphical, aimed at looking at the data in a preliminary and exploratory way in order to help understand what questions should be asked and what tentative models might be entertained. until recent years, however, this process was regarded by the majority as not entirely respectable. like the black art, it was widely felt that it should be conducted, if at all, only behind closed doors. 1 an early exception was the second chapter of statistical methods fo'l' research wo'i'kers (fisher 1925), first published in 1925, in which fisher discussed the use of preliminary graphical techniques. 3 it was a stroke of genius to realize that to render ""a deed without a name"" respectable, you should name it (or perhaps i should say rename it), and we are all grateful for the name ""data analysis."" this important part of our subject can now be studied without apology or shame, and courses on it are taught and may be attended by consenting adults. the elevation of data analysis to its proper place as a subject meriting serious study makes me as happy as i would be if some neglected but important activity of the carpenter, such as the use of the saw or the chisel, had at last received proper recognition and study. but my enthusiasm for the naming of data analysis does not extend to the renaming of statisticians as ""data analysts,"" any more than i should be happy to hear a carpenter described as a sawyer or a chiseler. indeed, i am as appalled by the appearance of data analysts as entities as i would be at contemplating one half of the baby over which solomon adjudicated, and for the same reason. there can be no feedback between the parts of a once living thing cut in two. please can data analysts get themselves together again and become whole statisticians before it is too late? before they, their employers, and their clients forget the other equally important parts of the job statisticians should be doing, such as designing investigations and building models? by invention of the concept of experimental design, fisher promoted the statistician from a curator of dusty relics to a valued member of a scientific team, responsible for planning and taking part in the conduct of an investigation. let us not allow him to be relegated to his previous passive and inferior role by an injudicious choice of a name. ""our data analyst"" is too close for my liking to ""our tame statistician,"" a poor thing if that is all he is. the statistical association finally, i want to talk a bit about our association because it is ours and it can be as good or as bad as we make it. during my time as president i have received a number of letters, all of them interesting and some of them critical. some members feel that we should be doing things we are not doing, some feel that we are doing things we should not be doing, some feel that the articles in our journals are not on the subjects they would like, or are not written with sufficient clarity. the suggestions made in such letters are, of course, given careful consideration not only by your president but by your board and its committees. if you have ideas on these or other subjects, however, and want to see something more done about them, i do urge you, if you have not done so already, to volunteer for active duty. the association is always seeking new faces and new ideas for its committees. and there are other things you can do too. suppose, for example, as a statistical practitioner, you feel that the journal technometrics is not adequately fulfilling that part of its mandate that says it will publish papers illustrating the application of known statistical method to new or novel environments, expository or tutorial papers on particular statistical methods, and papers dealing with the philosophy and problems of applying statistical methods to research, development, design and performance. i have it on good authority that editors have two problems in carrying out such a mandate: in the first place, articles of this kind are extremely hard to come by, and in the second place, referees tend to reject such articles for the wrong reasons (perhaps because they have not read the mandate). i urge you, therefore, to consider one or both of the following courses: 1. if you have suitable material, please write it up and send it in. 2. please volunteer to act as a referee. the editors are in desperate need of good referees for articles of this and every other sort. they need people who will go carefully through a paper, say encouraging words about good things, suggest how ideas could be clarified and how imperfections can be put right and who, when necessary, will firmly reject unsuitable manuscripts. in closing, i want to say how much i have enjoyed being your president, especially because of the kindness, consideration, and help i have received from the members, board, and officers. in particular, i wish to thank fred leone, ed bisgyer, jean smith, and the rest of the washington staff. the association is indeed fortunate to be served by such accomplished and dedicated people. reference fisher, r.a.

Hartley","1970-1999","what is statistics? this question may be provocative. a surprising question to be asked by any member of our association or, indeed, its president. yet, it may be fruitful to address it. you may have, in the past, been asked this question by a well meaning reporter anxious to write an “understandable” story about your depart ment or agency. it is somewhat embarrassing if you cannot answer it, and so you may think of a quickie like, “statistics is the science that tries to make sense out of variable answers.” just a wisecrack to satisfy your reporter? let us see, maybe there is a little more to this answer. statistics is indeed a science, but of course most statisticians are professional people who apply this science to their subject matter problems. many of us just use statistics as a tool kit and only rarely find it necessary to develop new tools, new statistical methods required to solve our real world problems. yet it behooves us from time to time to examine our basic concepts. what, then, is the “science of statistics”? it is a comparatively young science, although our historians have uncovered many interesting forerunners centuries ago. statistics is in a sense the antithesis to the classical deterministic science era of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. let us look at this era. the striking success of newtonian physics backed by applied mathematics had developed and strengthened the deterministic outlook of classical science. indeed, there was a time when the success of applying newtonian mechanics to physics and engineering stimulated applied mathematicians to look for a deterministic world law. a world law from which all phenomena in all sciences could be predicted. the mathematician laplace, in his early life an avid follower of newtonian mechanics, is reputed to have proudly proclaimed something like this : “once i have discovered the world law, then give me the initial positions and velocities of all particles in this world and i will predict future history.” modern science knows better. modern science has learned modesty and has long abandoned the dream of a deterministic outlook. indeed, the very postulate of laplace, “give me exact initial positions and velocities of all particles,” is nowadays ruled out as impossible by the famous heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. so even physics, the leader in the so called exact sciences, had to yield its determinism. statistics is part of this modern scientific outlook of uncertainty. its theory can be appropriately described as “the mathematics of un certainty.” the deterministic world law from which all phenomena can be exactly predicted is abandoned. if i may oversimplify our concepts, our laws may only predict “expectations” and the actual observations may differ from these by “statistical errors.” it is the study of these errors that enables us to make predictions under uncertainty. our mathematics of uncertainty governing these errors is sometimes described as the calculus of probability. but the science of statistics cannot be identified with the calculus of probability. for statistics is an applied science. its inferences vitally depend on concepts of the particular subject matter area to which statistics is applied. the areas of application comprise practically all sciences. to name a few: biology and agriculture, economics and sociology, physics and engineering, chemistry and biochemistry, biomedical science and pharmacology, human and animal psychology. rut more than that, statistics is applied to the operational or real world aspects associated with these sciences both in the public and private sectors. the mathematical aspects of statistics are only a part (often only a small part) of its effective application. 2. the balance between mathematical and applied statistics i now turn to the controversial problem concerning the distinction between applied statistics and mathematical statistics. ideally, of course, there should not be such a distinction. we should recognize that both are essential to statistical science. yet we have to be realistic and admit that most of us emphasize one trait or the other in our work. to my mind the difference between applied and mathematical statisticians is one of accepted priorities. to the applied statisticians it is of the utmost importance to obtain a mathematical formulation and solution of a problem that arises in the subject matter science or, indeed, in the real world. if it so happens that this can be satisfactorily accomplished with the help of “trivial mathematics,’’ they do not mind. on the other hand, if a realistic formulation of the problem leads them into mathematical problems beyond their own capability. they should and usually will seek the help of better mathematicians rather than oversimplify the model. by contrast, to the mathematical statisticians it is of first importance that their mathematical argument be of a high standard of ingenuity. they regard the possibility that their results may be applied to some scientific or real world problem as irrelevant or, indeed, as blasphemic. this attitude is so well illustrated by the toast of the cambridge mathematician (of g.h. hardy vintage), who was reputed to proclaim: l‘here is to mathematics, may she never be useful!” in spite of this toast, applied statisticians should feel fortunate that they may occasionally be able to interest a really first rate mathematical statistician to help them with a problem they cannot solve. the necessity for such help should, however, be the exception rather than the rule, and the training of competent applied statisticians must involve an adequate proficiency in “mathematical problem solving,” covering the full spectrum of mathematical statistics. the mathematical training should aim at conveying versatility in the formulation and tackling of new mathematical problems rather than infallibility in mathematical proof and rigor. if we acknowledge the need for both applied and mathematical statistics in our science, we must at the same time recognize that the professional statistician is predominantly concerned with applied problems. a glance at this meeting’s sessions will confirm this. i have learned that some of our mathematical friends lament that the “standard of our papers is low.” but i totally reject the notion that the merit of our applied papers should be measured with mathematical yard sticks. the question we should ask of these papers is, how well do they solve real world problems? irrespective of the level of mathematics required to accomplish this. on the other hand, we must not err on the other end of the scale. we often hear the argument that pure mathematical research in statistics with no application to real world problems is unnecessary. the fallacy in this argument is that even if we have no application at the present time, it may well be important in the future. let me give an example. two hundred years ago the german mathematician leipniz invented imaginary numbers. a pragmatic contemporary may well have ridiculed him for wasting his time. yet today, progress in radio engineering and many other branches of electronic wave propagation would be essentially unthink able without a mathematical background based on imaginary numbers. on a more recent theme, who would like to tackle multivariate problems without matrix calculus ! how do we recognize mathematical statistics researches with future social potential? this is perhaps one of the most difficult problems with which grant awarding agencies are faced. it is extremely dangerous to be shortsighted and prevent all activities that do not immediately contribute to the social problems of our generation. if such an attitude had been adopted through out history, i would see us statisticians doing our problems sitting on a beach and counting pebbles with amazing dexterity!! 3. the cooperation between statistician and subject matter specialist we have noted that the effective application of statistics vitally depends on expertise in the subject matter area to which it is applied. moreover, these areas of application are extremely diversified. how, then, is it possible for the statisticians to be expert in all these target areas? do they make the impudent claim to be the modern counterparts of the universal scientist of the middle ages? clearly, not so. many of us specialize in particular fields of application and this is well illustrated by the sections of our association. yet many of us are active in two or more sections, and the interests of individual sections are becoming more and more diversified and covering ever widening vistas, often leading to the creation of subsections. real expertise in all such areas of applications is becoming progressively more difficult. under such circumstances the only way for a statistician to be effective is to cooperate with a subject matter area specialist. the statisticians’ contribution will, therefore, be (a) their ability to under stand the problem posed by their fellow scientist, or technologist, or industrialist, or administrator and (b) the quantitative formulation and solution of that problem. indeed, the quantitative statistical formulation of the problem, sometimes called statistical model building, should normally be a cooperative effort blend ing the expertise of the subject matter specialist with the quantitative know how of the statistician. of the many cooperative activities, let me single out two examples in just one area that may be described as’“accelerated safety testing.” the first example is an animal experiment designed to estimate the so called virtually safe dose of a potential carcinogen. as might ’be expected, the acceptable risks of cancer incidence in animals are set at extremely low levels, such as one in a million, and the associated virtually safe doses are extremely low and lie in the so called residual dose range. it is often lamented by naive politicians that we do not experiment directly in this residual dose range. but if we would do that, we would require experiments of astronomical size to measure the risk increments over the background cancer incidence ! accordingly, such experiments are forced to use accelerated doses often thousandfold the virtually safe doses to be assessed. the responses to such accelerated doses yield measurable risk increments, but these must now be extrapolated backwards to the residual dose range. this methodology is still controversial and under development. it requires the close cooperation between statisticians, biochemists, and toxicologists in the building of suitable models on which this extrapolation can be based. an even harder problem arises in the extrapolation of the results from animal experiments over species to man. an analogous difficulty is encountered when assessing the reliability of engineering systems or components that are specified to perform at an extremely high level of reliability. the hazards to which such systems are exposed operationally are comparatively moderate. direct experimentation with such low hazard levels is often quite impractical. therefore, experiments are carried out at grossly accelerated hazards leading to measurable but considerably lower levels of reliability of performance. how do we extrapolate back to the operational hazard levels? the model used for this can only be evolved by the cooperation of the statistician with a host of technical experts. we are indeed fortunate that in these situations at least some, although limited, expert advice is available to the statistician; however, often the information that the subject matter area specialist has to offer is extremely scanty, indeed, sometimes nonexistent. this is usually not the expert’s fault. we may be looking at a data analysis problem in a new unexplored area. until quite recently such situations could make a statistician despair ! however, recent developments of the so called exploratory data analysis techniques must be regarded as a breakthrough, for they give at least a helpful hand in malting progress in such emergencies. such exploratory analysis must, however, be used only in these emergency situations for which they were designed. i note with some alarm recent tendencies of advocating the total banishment of the model based parametric method in favor of exploratory data analysis because the former may introduce biases if based on a wrong model. i do not welcome such developments. progress in scientific evolution has in the past relied on a seesaw of formulation of new theories followed by experimental verification or rejection. scientific theories correspond to our parametric model. if we avoid model formulation be cause our model may be wrong, we may stand in the way of progress. a useful exploratory data analysis should eventually be followed up by the formulation of para metric models. let me illustrate this thesis by a historic example. early in the 17th century the german astronomer johannes kepler had collected a large data bank on the movement of planets, the so called rodolphine tables. he then carried out what would today be de scribed as an extensive exploratory analysis of these data. his power of perception enabled him to summarize this exploratory data analysis in the so called kepler laws. here are the three kepler laws: 1. every planet describes an ellipse, the sun occupy ing its focus. 2. the line joining the center of the sun with the center of a particular planet sweeps over equal areas in equal times. 3. the squares of the times of revolution of planets around the sun are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. however, kepler’s work was followed shortly after by a triumphant model based analysis by isaac newton, who discovered his law of gravitation, which has become the cornerstone of newtonian physics. newton himself conceded that without kepler’s exploratory data analysis, he would not have been able to formulate his theory; but worse, where would physics be today without newton’s theory? let us learn a lesson from these scientific geniuses. is this a statistical example? it certainly is. kepler had to cope with measurement errors, with many outlier observations, and also with real astronomical error sources causing residuals, some of which could later be explained by a more refined application of newton’s model. my discussion of the cooperative projects in which statisticians are involved can only skim our extensive efforts in this area. however, i would be remiss if i did not mention some of the more successful activities developed jointly with chemical engineering. the two most important statistical techniques originally developed for use in the chemical industry are (as you may well know) response surface analysts and evolutionary operations. the first is mainly intended as a guide to experimentation in a pilot plant, where the experimental results from a pilot plant are expected to simulate the relation between an actual plant output and actual plant operating conditions. specifically, this technique explores the region of operating conditions resulting in maximum output. by comparison, evolutionary operations aim at similar objectives, but guide the running of an actual production process of a plant under operating conditions. the statisticians who have developed these methods have at all stages cooperated with the chemists, the chemical engineers, and other technical experts. indeed, the evop committee, which monitors the evolutionary operations of a plant, is advocated to comprise experts in the chemistry of the process and of the plant operation at all technical levels down to the level of the shop floor as well as a statistician. but the cooperation between statisticians and the chemical industry is not confined to these two techniques. the wide spectrum of joint activities covered becomes clearly apparent at the annual gordon re search conference or more precisely its section devoted to statistics, chemistry, and chemical engineering. we should also mention the annual princeton conference, organized jointly by the society for quality control, and our biopharmaceutical subsection, and numerous other meetings and workshops held on a more irregular basis. 4. problems of data acquisition i am sure that many of our members in the public and private sectors feel that practically all i have said so far has little relevance to their problems. for up to now i have focused on data analysis and have given little or no thought to the problem of how the data have been acquired. this problem of data acquisition is, i believe, the critical issue with which most professional statisticians must deal. again and again they are faced with the question, “where can i get data or information on this, that, and the other?” for example, we may need information on the rates of application of n p k fertilizers to wheat fields, the annual expenditure of sportsmen on hunting and fishing activities, the traffic density on specified sections of interstate and state highways and farm to market roads, the frequency of specified crimes in metropolitan, urban, and rural areas. some of this information may be available from so called official statistics sources, and certain guides to these have been prepared. for example, the directory of federal statistics for states, issued by the bureau of the census, may be very helpful. however, it may be distinctly risky to just identify a data source and then blindly proceed to use it. it is vital to also have information on the limitations afflicting such data sources, limitations both with regard to coverage and content errors. this applies particularly to overseas sources, such as those compiled by the united nations, for example. such additional information on the limitation of sources requires again a cooperation with experts concerned with the data compilation. most of the official statistics sources are derived from sample surveys (as opposed to complete censuses), conducted by federal and state agencies. of these, the three perhaps best known are the current population survey, a household survey, which is conducted monthly by the bureau of the census on behalf of the department of labor and gives us (among other social economic information) our monthly unemployment statistics ; the health interview survey, which is conducted annually by the national center for health statistics and is also a household survey that gives information on the state of health of the civilian population; and the enumerative survey, which is conducted each june and december by the department of agriculture and is a direct inter view survey of farm operators that provides estimates of agricultural production at a state and crop reporting district level. certain states use this survey to obtain county statistics. the sampling technique used is a two frame approach in which the usda area frame is combined with a mail survey, using county lists of the agricultural stabilization and conservation service. these lists are consolidated to form a list frame of operators’ addresses. these are only examples. there is an almost bewilder ing multitude of sample surveys conducted by federal and state agencies. but even so, the requirements of the private sector can rarely be met by federal and state statistics, and many surveys are conducted within the private sector, usually by survey oriented companies. the importance of this activity has been recognized by our association through the creation of a special section on sample survey research, a most active section. the word research in their title is not confined to re search in mathematical sample survey methodology. granted, there are many interesting mathematical problems arising from the design and analysis of sample surveys. it is rightly stressed by survey practitioners, however, that the most serious and important problems are those arising from the so called nonsampling aspects. very briefly these are 1. nonresponse or partial response of units, that is, the failure to obtain all or part of the information in the questionnaire from some of the sampled units; and 2. the so called content errors, that is, errors in the recorded answers to the questions. let us dwell in a little more detail on these concepts. a complete nonresponse is a well known malady afflict ing practically all sample surveys. unfortunately, the literature on how to deal with this malady is limited, and it is difficult to lay down guidelines that are generally applicable, since the most effective strategies will vary from survey to survey. a few general rules, however, can be laid down. it is acknowledged that the problem of nonresponse cannot be solved by simply sampling at a higher rate so that the sample of respondents corresponds to the originally specified target sample. the reason for this is that the nonrespondents will often differ from the respondents with regard to many of the characteristics. thus the sample of respondents will, in fact, be a biased sample. some methods of eliminating this bias have been proposed; however, it is usually better to make a real effort to reduce the percentage of nonresponse by organizational devices. broadly speaking, nonresponse problems will vary with (a) mandatory versus non mandatory data acquisition and (b) the technical method of data acquisition (i.e., personal interview surveys, mail surveys, etc.). only certain federal agencies have been endowed with the privilege of conducting surveys to which a response is mandatory (e.g., the population census and the census of agriculture), and reference may be made to their documented releases. briefly speaking, the non response rate in such surveys or censuses is consider ably lower. on the other hand, intricate problems of public relations result, since mandatory requests for information are resented by many sections of the public. the malady of partial nonresponse arises when the response to certain questions is either missing or the responses are “outliers” that have been rejected by the data editing process. a computerized procedure to “impute” such missing or suspect content items is the so called hot deck method in current use by the bureau of the census and other federal agencies. under certain circumstances, the imputation by the hot deck method is not feasible, in which case the questionnaire has to be regarded as a total nonresponse. in view of the importance of this problem of incomplete data analysis, workshops on the topic were conducted during the weeks preceding this and last year’s annual meetings. these workshops were specifically addressed to partial nonresponse in sample surveys. we are looking forward with anticipation to the reports and papers resulting from these workshops. it can be anticipated that considerable improvements in more heuristic methods like the hot deck will result from these activities. we now come to the last, but by no means the least, problem in data acquisition. after we have made a heroic effort to reduce the incompleteness of our data, we would be reckless to assume that there are no errors in the data that we have managed to acquire. in fact, overintensive efforts to avoid nonresponse may, in certain cases, result in faulty responses. it is, therefore, of paramount importance that, at all stages of data collection and processing, the quality of the data be controlled. one such control is the scrutiny of data for internal consistency. you have no doubt heard about the famous “teenage grandmothers” that turn up occasionally on census questionnaires and are duly eliminated. here the two answers to “relation to head of household = mother” and “age = 16” are clearly inconsistent. there are other inconsistencies that are less obvious, and yet others that are conceivably correct, such as a “son” whose age exceeds that of the wife of his father (she may be his stepmother). until quite recently such common sense data scrutiny and con sequential editing were performed by hosts of clerks. for studies of a more specialized nature, however, inconsistencies can, of course, only be discovered by personnel with the required expert knowledge. for example, in a study involving clinical examinations of cancer of the breast the classification of stage may have to be checked against the recorded anatomical or histological division codes. only personnel completely familiar with clinical concepts will, of course, be able to perform a scrutiny of such records. high speed computers are taking over more and more of these functions of data scrutiny. for this to be feasible, we must convey to the computer in minute detail the complete logical sequence of the involved check procedure, including all the “know how” as to “what the expert would be looking for.” moreover, for the computer to deal with cases that may be errors or may be correct data of an unusual nature, it must be able to refer to statistical information so that it can gauge a suspect discrepancy against a statistical tolerance. after all such information has been stored in the computer’s memory, the data from the particular study, survey, or census are passed through the computer for automatic scrutiny. as soon as the computer encounters an inconsistency, it is instructed to either (a) record the details of the suspected inconsistency in the data and list it for human inspection and reconciliation or (b) immediately correct any inconsistent item with the help of statistical estimation procedures and by using the data that it has already accepted. many organizations, such as the bureau of the census, concerned with automatic data scrutiny and editing, employ a judicious combination of (a) and (b). the procedure (a) is usually preferred in situations in which human eliminations of reconciled inconsistencies are administratively feasible, as it would be with smaller rather specialized studies. the method (b), called “imputation” of suspect data, is identical with that used for the estimation of missing content items ,discussed before in conjunction with partial nonresponse. it is used when the merging of a correction tape with the original data tape becomes practically infeasible, as is the case with certain census operations. with an adequate control on the frequency with which imputations are made, such a method has in fact been in successful use during the 1960 and 1970 population census. today the bureau of the census uses this and similar methods of data editing as an integral part of a tight quality control on data from which its releases are tabulated. it can be said that these activities constitute one of its main uses of high speed computers. although computerized data editing procedures are extremely helpful, they will as a rule only eliminate gross errors, still leaving the recorded content items afflicted by the so called nonsampling errors. if these errors could be assumed to be in the average zero and to be uncorrelated, the standard textbook variance formulas could be used to estimate the precision of the sample survey estimates. however, both assumptions are usually erroneous. a systematic bias in the nonsampling errors is particularly vicious, and such devices as the so called special record checks are often required for its control. to assess the effect of the so called nonsampling variances is more hopeful. there have recently been evolved certain techniques based on component of variance estimation, which look promising. again, it cannot be stressed too strongly that the statistician attempting to work in these areas must at all stages cooperate with subject matter specialists such as economists, sociologists, and agricultural experts familiar with the pitfalls in the data acquisition process. to those of you who are getting interested in this area i must greet you with the churchillian warning “expect nothing but toil, sweat, and tears!” 5. the impact of computers on statistics modern statistics is heavily dependent on the high speed computer. it is appropriate therefore to dwell more fully on the impact of computers on statistics. there is, of course, no question that they will affect the computational aspects of statistics. however, will they reach the heart and soul of our science and technology, will they influence the outlook of statisticians? i think they will. in my brief report on this influence i will confine myself to a few selected aspects. i have already mentioned the important role of computers in the acquisition and editing of data. although this activity seems, at first sight, to be of a trivial nature it is in fact one of the most challenging applications of high speed computer technology. from a mathematical point of view, the problem of error detection is essentially unsolvable, simply because the number of all possible error patterns is combinatorially of an astronomical magnitude. however, with the help of experts in the acquisition of each data bank, it is possible to select likely error patterns and construct consistency checks most likely to unmask errors in the data. all of these techniques depend heavily on high speed computer programs and could not have been executed without their help. turning next to the analysis of data. the techniques most frequently used in this activity are analysis of variance and regression analysis. many excellent computer systems are now available for performing these computations. undoubtedly the availability of computers has increased the capabilities of research teams who had previously to rely on desk computers, which could only cover the analysis of a fraction of their data. a computer service center is characteristically faced with the analysis of a large number of small data sets. the time in which each individual set can be analyzed is phenomenally short. however, this benefit would be completely annulled if a new program had to be written for every small problem. this difficulty is overcome by using statistical computer packages providing, as it were, prefabricated programs for a great variety of small analysis problems sequenced by an efficient operating system. so impressive is the efficiency and so small the cost of the package analysis that there is a tendency to analyze every problem by an option provided by the package. granted we have some excellent packages providing a great variety of options. however, the result of indiscriminately using a packaged analysis may be deplorable. indeed, in certain cases we may witness a highly efficient production of a printout completely irrelevant to the statistical problem at hand. examples of this kind are the indiscriminate use of multiple comparison options where the treatment means are really a set of ordered responses (e.g., the yields for a crop measured for different rates of fertilizer applications). this problem is a response curve problem and not one for multiple comparisons. again, in an unbalanced analysis of variance there is a tendency to regard all factors as “fixed” simply because such an analysis can be handled more easily by a package option. another misuse of computer packages arises from a naive acceptance of the model assumptions underlying the packaged analysis and an even more naive assumption that there are no errors in the data. fortunately, most packages provide data and model monitoring options such as a printout of residuals or more sophisticated devices. i wish these monitoring options would be used more frequently, as they provide beneficial information to the experimenter about the scientific mechanism that has generated the data or, indeed, a mechanism that has generated gross errors. it is sometimes lamented that in the “good old days,” when experimenters “did their own sums of squares” on a desk computer, they were learning a lot about their data and that the computer destroys this intimate contact. now we must distinguish between doing sums of squares on a desk computer as opposed to an intelligent scrutiny of the printed residuals. the former is to my mind pointless, the latter is a highly desirable use of the computer’s potentials, and we cannot agree with the contention. we next turn to the capability of the computer to perform large and extensive computations. thus we can invert larger matrices, can solve larger systems of simultaneous equations, and can solve larger programming problems. this capability of solving larger and more comprehensive problems gives us more freedom in the building of our models. our models can be more comprehensive and, hopefully, more realistic, taking account of effects that in the past had to be neglected and generated undesirable noncentralities in our statistical errors. we are witnessing a tendency to fit bigger and better models. is the sky the limit? we must clearly back up here and realize that in most problems the limits are set by the available data bank. let us illustrate the dilemma with the so called simultaneous equation models in econometric forecasting. suppose we are trying to make our model more realistic and add more exogenous variables to our supermodel. alas, we will often find that the fit now becomes nonestimable, as we have too many variables. so we decide to extend the data bank by going back in our span of years. but the inclusion of the extra years may represent a period in which another set of exogenous variables cannot be neglected and so we must add these, and so on, ad infinitum. the number of exogenous variables is chasing the data span and the data span is chasing the number of exogenous variables : a rather startling illustration that we have to practice parsimony in spite of the computer. finally, i turn to a development that i personally consider perhaps the most important impact of computers, namely, their use in statistical model building. classical statistical analysis once insisted on the use of mathematical models for which compact mathematical solutions could be found. this generated a tendency on the part of analysts to restrict their studies to such tractable models, even at the expense of making them unrealistic. with the computer’s capabilities we need not be afraid of formulating more realistic models, thereby freeing the scientists from the fetters of analytic tractability. to quote an example, the so called rate equations governing the time dependence of chemical reactions are usually assumed to be linear first order differential equations with constant rate coefficients. these give rise to the well known analytic solutions of mixtures of exponentials that have often been fitted to data obtained from a study of chemical reaction processes. it is well known to the chemist that a model with constant rates is often an oversimplification. nonlinear rate equations are often more realistic. however, we usually cannot solve the resulting nonlinear rate equations analytically. by contrast, the computer has no difficulty solving more realistic rate equations by numerical integration and fitting these numerical integrals directly to the data. the parameters in the rate equations then be come the unknown parameters in the nonlinear regression fit. the rapidity of numerical integration sub routines is essential for this approach to be feasible. there are many other instances in which numerical analysis can and will replace analytic solutions. future research will therefore be able to search more freely for realistic models incorporating the full spectrum of information that is at the disposal of scientists. indeed, they will use the computer as a powerful tool in trying alternate model theories, all of a complex but realistic form, to advance their theories on empirical phenomena. obviously the answer is not to discourage our colleagues from learning and using statistics. indeed, we should and do actively help them in this endeavor by providing a wide spectrum of statistics courses oriented towards applications in various subject matters. both our colleagues and we will benefit from their statistical knowledge in our effort to communicate. on the other hand, we consider it infeasible for them to be real experts in their fields and at the same tame have a complete knowledge of statistics that would enable them to dispense with the services of a statistician. however, it is up to us to make a convincing case for this contention. to do this we must practice first rate statistics, statistics that is of such a quality that our offer of help is an offer that our colleagues cannot refuse! cannot refuse because a refusal would waste their time doing amateurish statistics instead of bringing their sound expertise to bear on the fruitful cooperation with the professional statisticians who know what they are doing. of course the maxim to practice first class workman6. the identity of the statistical profession my last section will address a widespread concern among statisticians, 1 am now addressing the growing concern about the identity of the statistical profession, the concern about justifying our very existence. plication of statistics requires the cooperation between the statistician and the specialist in the subject matter ship is one that should be applied to any technology with a pride in professional perfection. yet we statisticians seem to be singled out for a particular scrutiny. let us look by comparison at the legal profession, for example. company will often involve considerable engineering expertise for their effective resolution. they require the 1 have repeatedly emphasized that the effective apthe legal problems that arise, let us say, in an engineering area to which statistics is applied. indeed a good statistician will acknowledge that a successful cooperation participation of the company’s technical experts. yet what engineering suggest that requires subject matter area judgments that only the specialist possesses. on the other hand, specialists should recognize that the application of statistical techniques activity. now it is usually accepted without question that the input of the subject matter specialist is vital. on the other hand, we witness with some concern the tendency to question the role of statisticians. this tendency is fanned by the fact that there are indeed many problems that are not amenable to statistical treatment. we statisticians must certainly refrain from forcing statistics into a problem where it is not needed. but the error “of the second kind” that our colleagues often commit is not to use statistics at all when it is badly needed. how many failures in the public sector would have been avoided by a timely statistical analysis, revealing risks of an unreasonable order of magnitude? in its most blatant form the tendency to ignore statisticians questions the need for statistics as a profession and raises doubts about the very identity of statistics as of economists, industrial and management engineers, computer scientists, sociologists, psychologists, and many others trying to act as their own statisticians. what is the answer to this problem? their engineers should take law classes at night school and to do their own legal work? quite apart from the fact that they have to acquire a law degree to energy required on the part of these engineers would severely interfere with time devoted to activities in their own engineering profession. who would suggest that a company’s social workers should take first aid courses to try to dispense with the company’s physician? who would suggest that an insurance company’s experienced salesmen should take night classes in actuarial science to try to do away with the company’s actuary when developing a new policy? here then we have, i believe, the answer. for what applies to all these professions applies with equal justification to statistics as a profession. we must convince our colleagues in other areas that they would be wasting their time dabbling in statistics in an inept do it yourself extravaganza. and convince we shall. for we shall not idly look on while our professional identity is being destroyed. let me close with an analog to a well known wartime ex liwe

Martin","1970-1999","more than 140 years ago a few men met in boston to form what shortly became known as the statistical association. article i1 of its first constitution ex plained the purpose succinctly: “the objects of the society shall be to collect, preserve and diffuse statistical information in the different departments of human knowledge” ( statistical association 1940). we have come a long way since then. it may be useful, however, to refresh our minds concerning that original purpose. government statistics bureaus are among the more prominent organizations specifically charged to collect, preserve, and diffuse statistical information. statisticians in the private sector who apply statistical methods to problems in science, in industry, in medicine, for example, are sometimes puzzled by the different interests of their colleagues in government bureaus of statistics. they ask questions such as, why does not the office of federal statistical policy and standards have more staff trained in statistical methods? why do not more statisticians become heads of government statistics agencies? i shall not try to justify the present state of affairs, but i should like to comment on some of the distinguishing characteristics between statistical practice in government and outside government. i have two objectives. one is to draw attention to some of the important current issues in federal statistics. another is to emphasize the importance of certain statistical practices beyond those commonly considered a part of statistical science. statistical methods applied to problems in the laboratory, on the agricultural plot, in the manufacturing control process may not differ much whether the sponsor is a government, a university, a corporation, or an individual scientist. but statistics viewed as a product, that is, data collected and disseminated for the use of others, does differ in important ways from statistics considered as a science or a methodology. it is to this part of government statistics that the rest of this paper is confined. persons trained in statistical methodology think of statistics as a scientific discipline, but most of the rest of the world uses the term to mean orderly arrays of data, an end product of statistical activity sets of numbers, tables, or graphs. many of us are ambivalent and move back and forth, using the discipline oriented concept when talking about the qualifications of a particular statistician for filling a particular post, and using the product oriented definition when referring to the functions and activities of government statistics bureaus. (for further discussion, see kruskal 1978, healy 1978.) what is different about statistics considered as product rather than as method? let us look at the process of producing and summarizing large data sets for the use of others, the principal function common to large government statistics bureaus. in one sense, producing statistics as an end product is a narrower concept than applying statistical methodology across a whole range of problems; any one bureau of statistics or similar organization usually focuses on only one class or kind of subject matter area. in another sense, it is broader. it encompasses not only statistical methodology as a tool, but the whole gamut of activities that must be performed in producing statistics for the use of others planning, collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data. the practice of many of these functions is not based primarily on statistical science or methodology, but is an art based on a mixture of intuition, experience, and judgment, as well as scientific evidence or procedures in other words, the practice of a profession as well as the application of a scientific discipline (hartley 1980). statistical methodology is a part, but only a part, of the process. i believe these statements are descriptive of any application of statistics, but that they are more evident components of statistical activity in organizations whose primary function is data collection and compilation of general purpose statistics than in other areas of application. when i joined the federal statistical system in 1943 there was, of course, major emphasis on the production of statistics to guide the war effort. more basic than this temporary practical use of detailed data, however, was the widely and even passionately held belief that the success of our economic and social systems depended to a significant degree on the quality and widespread availability of statistical information about the operation of these systems. economic statistics had recently been overhauled and expanded during the depression decade, and there was hope that the state of society could similarly be quantified (committee on government statistics and information services 1937). the development of the national accounts and the employment act of 1946 added further impetus. at that time, the users of the information, the decision makers, were viewed as innumerable, anonymous individuals using impartial information to make a multitude of decisions on matters of importance to them. this view contrasts with the view of statistics collected for a particular purpose to fit the needs of a particular problem with an identified decision maker. both views may reflect reality, of course, sometimes for the same data set. during the last three decades the awareness of statistics as a tool of central decision making has grown, accompanying the expanded use of statistics in planning, operating, and evaluating many government programs, in monetary and fiscal policy, and in regulatory activities. the growing reliance on statistics in central decision making should be gratifying to statisticians; the results of our labors are being used. it also imposes on government and the statistical profession great responsibilities in supplying relevant and accurate information. increased reliance on statistics in decision making has also led to a view of statistical information as power. this, in turn, has created some uncertainty over the proper location of statistics gathering organizations within the federal government. on the one hand, the statistics must be relevant to the problems perceived by society; on the other, they must be neutral with respect to partisan solutions. if the statistics bureau is too close to policy planning and analysis, it runs the risk of becoming partisan. if it is too insulated from policy considerations, the statistics bureau may be perceived and treated as a routine production operation, a mere numbers factory, a view all too prevalent among administrators. for this reason, as well as to improve the quality of the data themselves, heads of statistics bureaus seek to establish subject matter analytical units within their staffs. such units help to identify priorities (see national research council 1976), interact with technical statisticians, deal with policy analysis groups established elsewhere in their departments on questions of concern to departmental decision makers, interact with the research community and other outside users, and provide a channel through which all these interests have an impact on the data collection operation. without such internal analytical capability, planning functions are likely to suffer. in the following i shall identify what appear to me to be important characteristics of the process of providing data for the use of others. the list is by no means exhaustive. i have chosen topics either because of their important effects on the activities of statistics bureaus or to direct attention to aspects not normally considered a part of statistical science that might benefit from additional attention from highly trained statisticians. 2. priorities a critically important function of an organization producing statistics is to set priorities. what statistics must be collected? develop new data or improve the accuracy or efficiency of an ongoing series? use more resources in analysis, in testing the quality of current operations, or in disseminating results more widely? needs, technical feasibility, and costs must be considered. the choices are myriad, the guideposts infrequent, and the advice of different stakeholders (or users) conflicting. a large fed eral statistics bureau is at some distance from the users of its data, from internal government decision makers (sometimes even those in its own department), to say nothing of other users such as the congress, other levels of government, researchers in universities and elsewhere, and the general public. a conscious effort must be made to keep up with the needs of these various groups and to resolve conflicting views into a sensible program. the difficulties are great. the process is not well understood even by those who are trying to determine priorities, still less by others. an example from my own experience at the bureau of the budget may illustrate the difficulties. you will recall the enormous pressure to speed up our space program and land a man on the moon following sputnik. the space agency had proposed a greatly in creased budget and the budget examiner responsible for reviewing this request asked me what the matter was with the statistical program at the national science foundation. it appeared that one group of critics was charging that if the budget request were to be approved it would require the employment of half the trained physicists in the country; another group countered that the program would only need 10 percent of the physicists. the national science foundation could not tell the examiner the correct figure overnight. he thought that the coordinating statistical office, in which i was employed, should work with the foundation to develop a more relevant, policy oriented program of statistics to be better prepared for the next urgent demand for information. he was unable to tell me, however, o r to obtain from his colleagues even tentative list of issues for which statistics would be needed in the future. similar examples could be found concerning every statistics producing unit in the federal government. i draw two conclusions. one is that policy makers and other users frequently judge the quality of a statistics program on the basis of what types of statistics are produced whether they answer the important immediate questions, rather than on the quality of those statistics. the other conclusion is that statistics bureaus are unlikely to get immediate and easy answers about either present or future needs from the people for whom the statistics are compiled. subject matter analysts and practicing statisticians must become involved on an interacting basis. as pointed out earlier, experienced bureau chiefs want analysis units within their own staffs units that by en gaging in substantive studies can learn the virtues and deficiencies of the existing information; can deal on a continuing basis with policy analysts and decision makers outside the bureau; and can keep abreast of external re search. such activities are those most likely to point to needs for new or different information. such units should have explicit responsibility for participating in setting priorities. in setting priorities, as in much else of its planning and design undertakings, a federal statistics bureau operates within a decentralized, but loosely coordinated, statistical system. coordination is intended to make the separate data collections of different bureaus more useful (because the results are designed to be aggregated or to be analyzed in concert) or to make them more efficient (by eliminating duplication or unnecessary differences in definitions or by arranging for access to independent sampling frames, for example). a recently completed review of the coordinating function recommends centralizing and strengthening the coordinating office and, among other improvements, would explicitly assign to that office responsibility for leadership in improving the application of statistical methodology in federal data collection activities (bonnen 1980). legislation to accomplish this has recently been introduced in the senate. a fairly recent development, initially motivated by the statistical association, has been the organization of the committee of professional associations on federal statistics (copafs). which now includes 12 member associations. the general objectives are to in crease the involvement of the professional associations in issues of general importance in federal statistics and to monitor the changing situation as it affects the federal statistical product relevant to the user needs of the associations. sufficient support has become available to establish an executive office for copafs in the early fall of this year. it is expected that in the future there will be increasing interaction between the federal statistical system and the professional community representing many aspects of special user interests, among which will, no doubt, be the setting of priorities. 3. concepts another major activity of statistics bureaus is the definition of concepts, an activity that is both difficult and extremely important in much of federal multipurpose data collection. both economic and social theory have de voted insufficient attention to defining units of analysis in terms appropriate for data collection. unlike many of the experimental sciences, concepts are seldom rigorously tested under laboratory conditions. a well known example is the case of employment and unemployment. macroeconomics deals with “labor” and the price of labor. if one wants to measure labor, should one measure the number of persons at work, or jobs held, or hours spent at work? there are uses for each of these measures. it took economists and statisticians working together for nearly a decade during the thirties, first to agree on basic concepts, and second to develop reasonably satisfactory and mutually compatible definitions of employment and unemployment, definitions that were workable in house hold surveys and that with only minor changes are still being used today, though not without continued questioning. another, and as yet unsettled, example is the concept of ethnicity and the problem of its definition in censuses and surveys. social theory suggests no easy answer, usually assuming self identification. a variety of different definitions have been used in practice: place of parents’ birth, mother tongue, language spoken in the home, origin or descent. the current census asks, “are you a ?” and then provides a check list. some are dubious that this form of the question will produce useful results and have argued that the questions on birthplace of parents, despite their more limited relevance, are to be preferred in view of their greater objectivity and presumed reliability. ethnic origin is but one of numerous characteristics and classifications that require continuing dialogue, experimentation, and testing, with both statisticians and subject matter specialists making contributions. these issues do not occur only in the social sciences, but range across the life and physical sciences as well. the national center for health statistics devoted much effort to develop a widely applicable concept of disability, finally arriving at a definition of conditions limiting activity. those compiling statistics on skin cancer are plagued by the difficulty of distinguishing between new and recurring cases. oil and gas production statistics are riddled with definitional problems. and so it goes. it is not sufficient for the statistician to say that such concepts and definitions are not his or her business, that these questions belong exclusively to the subject matter specialist. 4. descriptive statistics the multipurpose statistics collected by government statistics bureaus are primarily descriptive statistics. the immediate occasion for their collection is usually a practical one, not the search for scientific truths. nevertheless, these descriptive statistics are frequently incorporated into scientific theories or assist in the development of new knowledge. the population censuses, originally prescribed for the apportionment of congressional seats, have, together with the birth and death statistics developed to promote public health, formed the basis of the science of demography. the census of manufactures and our statistics of international trade, designed to support the infant economy of a new country, were the forerunners of an enormous array of economic data that are used not only for current monitoring of the economy but also to test economic theories and are incorporated into econometric models to analyze relationships. weather statistics provide some of the raw data for the atmospheric sciences. thus opportunities do arise for the development of new knowledge in connection with what may appear to be mundane data collection activities. the processes of collecting, summarizing, analyzing, and disseminating data, furthermore, afford ample opportunity, given sufficient resources, for the application of statistical methodology and the development of new statistical techniques. illustrative of these opportunities are survey sampling theory, estimates of statistical error, the handling of incomplete data in surveys and in analysis, matching or linking of data sets, the design of experiments used in testing concepts, definitions, or collection methods, and various analytical devices, such as simulation models and the research on methods of seasonal adjustment now being furthered under a joint asa census bureau program. 5. estimates of error government statisticians have long worked on problems of statistical error and have been particularly successful in telling users about sampling error. attempts to describe biases and response error, and thus total error, have been a more recent development. a recent effort at quantifying nonsampling error is the report “an error profile: employment as measured by the current population survey” (u.s. office of federal statistical policy and standards 1979). statisticians need the cooperation and assistance of subject matter specialists to identify and describe the sources and magnitudes of response error and bias. yet the concept of bias measured only in a statistical sense, as a difference between the expected value of the estimate and the true value being estimated, seldom satisfies the subject matter specialist, who is in many cases more concerned with the relevance of the expected value of the quantity measured to the concept that fits his or her theory or problem. this may be particularly true of analysts who are not collecting their own data but are using data collected for other purposes, as so frequently happens with multipurpose economic and social data. i recall hearing a statistician ask an economist why economists paid so little attention to the error structure in the data they used. the economist replied that in her view, conceptual relevance of the data was 85 percent of her problem, and error but 15 percent. even though statisticians cannot incorporate such concerns in error formulas, they can be sensitive to issues of relevance in joint explorations of error measurement. john tukey called attention to these issues in his recent paper on the statistician’s responsibility for both accuracy and relevance (tukey 1979). because data produced by federal statistics bureaus frequently are national in scope, and therefore refer to the same universe, differences in series that ostensibly measure the same or very similar phenomena are glaringly obvious. this can be acutely embarrassing to the producers of the data. if two different bureaus are involved, each is likely to point to all the reasons the other’s estimates are weak reasons that sound sensible, are frequently based on supposition, rather than scientific evidence, and seldom tell the whole story. i worked at one time with a small interagency group that put together employment and unemployment estimates from different sources into a single public release. to take the employment estimates, for instance, each was produced monthly, referred to the same time period, used the same classifications (with some exceptions), but was based on a different operational definition of employment. one was a probability sample of persons with a job, obtained from households with an estimated sampling error and (in com parison with the other) with considerable month to month sampling variability. the other was based on re ports of filled jobs from employers, and thus included double counting of persons holding more than one job, was not a probability sample, but was subject to much less monthly variation. adherents of the former series pointed to its proper probability design, overlooking the bias of the population undercount; adherents of the latter pointed to the presumed accuracy of employer reports compared with household surveys, and the lower variability, overlooking the biased survey design. meanwhile, the public wanted to know what was happening to employment each month. even if estimates of total error had been available for each series, i doubt if that question could have been answered definitively (although no doubt our uncertainty would have been greatly reduced), since each estimate of error would have been couched in terms of the definitions appropriate to its own frame. lacking estimates of total error, the interagency group writing the monthly release tried to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each series, to explain reasons for glaring differences in month to month changes (not always possible), and to give the public an overall view of what was happening to some ill defined, underlying concept of employment as reflected by two different measurements. these series are still being announced in a combined release, although the responsibility is now that of a single bureau (see “the employment situation,” press release issued monthly by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics). the point i should like to make, however, is that the existence of two ostensibly similar series can be a boon as well as a bane to statistical enterprise. differences in level and change can call attention to problems, especially to nonsampling errors and, if taken seriously, can lead to improvements in one or both series. efforts to reconcile the two employment series, for example, led to many improvements, extensions, and additional analyses improvements that have provided a wealth of additional information on the labor force. attempts to ex amine relevance, as well as nonsampling error, might well start with comparisons between other such closely re lated series. 6. pressures for more another characteristic circumstance of much federal data collection is the insistent pressure for more. once statistical information is produced, it is generally used. and once used, pressures start building for more more detail, greater frequency, more prompt availability. if a series is issued quarterly, it is wanted monthly, if it is national in scope, it is wanted for regions, or states, or all standard metropolitan statistical areas, or even every county (3,000) or every political entity (39,000). the census bureau has been faced several times during the past decade with the task of making population and in come estimates for 39,000 units as updates from the 1970 census for general revenue sharing purposes. half of these 39,000 units have a population of less than 1,000. the bureau of labor statistics is currently required to estimate employment and unemployment monthly for 5,000 areas. other statistics bureaus face similar demands for state and local data. the quality of such efforts is limited not only by re sources budgets, statistical talent, and other inputs to the statistical operation but also by the burden imposed on respondents. although much of the government’s paperwork burden is not for statistical purposes tax collection, regulatory activities, provision of benefits for which applications must be filed large scale statistical surveys must consider the burden imposed on suppliers of data and the mounting resistance to paperwork. such resistance is particularly strong in the case of small business organizations. statistical surveys, furthermore, may depend on tax or regulatory or other administrative re porting programs to establish universes, provide sampling frames, or reduce the burden of reporting for small units. the economic censuses, for example, use a few items of information from tax returns rather than collecting du plicate information directly from large numbers of very small firms. economizing on the burden of answering forms is thus a federal objective (see commission on federal paper work 1977). exchange of information among statistics bureaus for statistical purposes only, and with strict confidentiality for individual reports, is one device that can economize on both resources and burden (president’s commission on federal statistics 1971 ; asa committee on privacy and confidentiality 1980). another device for reducing burden is the joint collection of information by federal and state statistics bureaus. other devices have been sought, such as the use of synthetic estimates in which ratios from a current national survey are applied to less current state or local information to develop cur rent state or local estimates (purcell and kish 1980). the search for new estimating and analytic methods should continue to help relieve the pressure for ever increasing detail. much of the demand for geographic detail arises from legislation. the most historic use is prescribed in the constitution, the use of population census counts to determine the number of representatives from each state and to fix the boundaries of congressional districts. more recently, congress has specified increased detail in legislation to ensure that funds are distributed to localities in accordance with its intent, or has required that information needed for planning or evaluating the success of various programs is available. formulas are incorporated into laws for the distribution of funds in more than 100 programs in which population data are used (u.s. congress 1975). in other programs, information such as the unemployment rate is used to trigger the starting and stopping of benefit programs in local areas. some work has been started on ways to tailor allocation formulas or trigger mechanisms so that statistical errors will have less effect on the results (u.s. office of federal statistical policy and standards 1978), but much more.needs to be done. uses of statistics for fund allocations or triggering mechanisms bring pressures for increased accuracy and additional detail. as nathan keyfitz has pointed out (1979), such uses of statistics assume certainty rather than the uncertainty with which statisticians are accustomed to deal. as he noted, certainty can only be assumed by convention, conventions that are necessary because otherwise dollars could not be parceled out or programs started and stopped by formula. the 1980 census will, of course, be used for much of the fund distribution in the next few years. in the past, the convention has been implicit that census figures are correct for such purposes. census statisticians, evaluating the completeness of the decennial censuses, have called attention to an undercount of the population that is relatively more serious for blacks and probably other minority groups. these estimates of undercount, derived by methods of demographic analysis, are not available for small areas; even state estimates of the undercount are uncertain. now, because of increasing awareness of the undercounts, their presumed uneven impact on different localities, and the greatly expanded use of census statistics in allocation formulas, the bureau of the census faces the troublesome question of whether adjustments should be made in census data, and if so, in what fashion (see national research council 1978 and u.s. bureau of the census 1980). statisticians should note that this problem is not con fined to enumerating the population or to fund allocation. in private contracts as well as in federal regulation, fund allocation, or administration, many other statistics, rang ing from wage rates, prices, and corporate financial figures to emissions of pollutants and estimates of air quality, are used as if they were without error. adjustments are used relatively freely in some estimates, such as the national accounts. here the data are controlled by an accounting framework and missing pieces estimated and inadequate pieces adjusted by the economists and statisticians who prepare the estimates. this practice, as well as the fact that the national accounts are pieced together from hundreds of different data sources, has effectively prevented any meaningful estimates of the error structure of the accounts. there are obviously very different views and practices regarding adjustments in different data sets. statisticians should be concerned, not only with estimating statistical error, but with methods for dealing with uncertainty in situations that require an assumption of certainty in the statistics. how far, for example, should a statistics bureau go in making adjustments, under what circumstances, on what basis, with what justification? these are questions that statisticians have normally shunned or considered the province of others, possibly because of the policy implications. 7. counting statisticians engaged in collecting multipurpose data are perceived by the rest of the world as engaged in count ing an operation often regarded as the most elementary numerical process, not only by the public but also by other statisticians. even though the mathematical design for collecting information may be simple, the practice of collection is almost invariably difficult. errors, and the opportunity for making errors, abound. one need not point only to the population undercount. during the 1973 energy crisis there were problems with data on imports of oil, reflecting difficulties of assigning imports to the same time periods in different sets of records. the u.s. and canada have undertaken a detailed, laborious investigation attempting to match total imports of the one country with exports from the other, and could not resolve all discrepancies despite years of good faith effort. employer reports of employment and wages to tax agencies differ from statistical surveys even when the tax records are the mailing list sources for the surveys. in addition to sampling error, likely causes are different reference periods, incompatible definitions of units, classification problems, errors of omission, double counting, and response error. 8. analysis since statistics bureaus collect data primarily for the use of others, some believe it is unreasonable to expect them to engage in substantive analysis. they may fear that such analysis might distort data collecting priorities or delay public dissemination of the data. nevertheless, a criticism frequently expressed is that statistics bureaus do not do enough analysis. i agree with the latter views. of course, there is usually some analysis. for example, the development of models and projections may be considered one form of analysis population projections, input output tables, econometric models, or seasonal adjustment procedures have all been developed at least in part by statistics bureaus. currently, several longitudinal surveys are being supported by federal agencies, with funding for analysis provided primarily to outside re searchers. development of new analytic techniques for efficient analysis of longitudinal surveys may possibly emerge. i believe that more analysis by statistics bureaus, whether by their own staffs exclusively or in cooperation with others, would lead to improvements in the base data, to a better understanding of priorities, to better documentation of the data for use by others, and possibly to new knowledge as the result of the analysis. the close tie between analysis and data improvement is not generally understood and, indeed, is not clearly documented. budget authorities and congressional appropriations committees are unaware of the importance of analysis in leading to improved data and also may fear that analysis would not be politically neutral. the research community is, on the whole, considerably more interested in obtain ing the data for its own independent use than concerned about building up analytic strength in federal statistics bureaus. nevertheless, there are signs of increasing analysis in some statistics bureaus and some examples of cooperative analysis between such bureaus and independent researchers, and i hope these can be encouraged. 9. dissemination statistics bureaus spend much time on methods of dis tributing their products effectively. the theoretical statistician writes a report for a research journal and typically leaves it up to others to seek out and use the results of his research. the statistical consultant has direct contact with the users of his advice. but the statistics bureau, at a greater distance from users and operating on public funds, should feel a responsibility for making data avail able in convenient forms and for explaining how the data were compiled and outlining their weaknesses and strengths. many of you may feel that few statistics bureaus have gone far enough in this direction. efforts to improve dissemination are being made, how ever. for example, microdata samples for public use have been prepared much more frequently in recent years, and rather than the last results to be disseminated, are now much more likely to be near the first. some bureaus provide computer access to large arrays of aggregated data. some statistics bureaus have instituted occasional conferences of users to promote the use of their data for research and to obtain feedback from users. documentation remains a problem, one of concern to all applied statisticians on which much work should be encouraged in the future. dissemination to policy makers and the general public is frequently accompanied by descriptive comment and graphs, calling attention to noteworthy facts. it is to be hoped that the recent resurgence of interest in tabular presentation and in graphical techniques (beniger and robyn 1978; fienberg 1979) will lead to improved prac tice. how the news media adopt and adapt such news releases is still another problem. it may be too much to expect headline writers to understand measurement error. just recently, a headline in the washington post read, “jobless rate edges up to 7.8 percent.” the one tenth of one percent change reported in the unemployment rate was less than one standard error of consecutive monthly change. even so, this was an improvement over a headline 20 years ago that read, as i remember, “government says unemployment unchanged, but actually it increased by one tenth of a point.” there is another type of dissemination of information about the methods and practices developed and used in statistics bureaus. this is commonly an undernourished activity. more needs to be done, not only in encouraging reporting of methodological research in the journal of the statistical association and in other professional journals, but in describing methods and procedures that might be useful to others but are not sufficiently original for inclusion in jasa. i hope that more opportunities will be afforded in the future for such publication. i look forward to the day when the statistical association will find a way in its publication program to recognize the needs of statisticians and their colleagues engaged in data collection, compilation, and dissemination not by changing jasa, of whose worldwide re known we can all be proud but by one or more additional publications. if statisticians as professionals seek a wider application of statistical methods in data collection, in other scientific disciplines, and in management and ad ministration, whether public or private, we may need to devote more effort to communicating with nonstatisticians in interesting and beneficial ways. 10. conclusion i have touched on some of the concerns of statistics bureaus in producing data for public use, intentionally skipping over most purely statistical science concerns. in describing some of the circumstances in which statisticians practice in statistics bureaus, my purpose has been to encourage more interaction with other disciplines and more attention by statisticians to problems of concept, public policy, or practice concerns that they may initially view as beyond their bailiwick. in this review of statistics as a process of data collection, compilation, and dissemination in federal bureaus, i have made a number of recommendations that i briefly summarize here. i urge acceptance of the proposal for a strengthened central coordinating office for federal statistics; i support legislation that would permit exchange of data among statistical bureaus with suitable confidentiality safe guards; and i recommend strong internal analysis staffs in statistics bureaus. one thread that runs through the other recommendations is the need for strong and continuing interaction between statisticians and subject matter specialists in setting priorities within statistics bureaus, in developing concepts and definitions, in exploring relevance as well as the measurement of error, and in improving methods of disseminating data. furthermore, i have suggested that statisticians, whether in or outside statistics bureaus, can make contributions to methods for dealing with the uncertainty inherent in statistics in such practical applications as formula allocations of funds; can develop improved methods of data collection and analysis to meet the increasing demands for additional detail; need to devote much more attention to problems of documentation; and should be encouraged to publish more descriptions of methods and procedures for nontechnical as well as technical audiences. statisticians who follow these suggestions will tend to concentrate on one or a few areas of application. in this way, they can obtain sufficient background to help fill the wide gaps between methodology and practice. such steps may be deemed to run counter to the view that statistics is not specific to subject matter, that statisticians should move easily from one field of application to another, and thereby spread new methodology more widely and more quickly. i believe these views need not be in conflict. both types of statisticians are needed. in my opinion, the training of statisticians in statistical sciences gives insufficient weight to the need for statisticians interested in data collection problems. many of the statisticians now engaged in data collection have moved to it from other disciplines. there might be a two way flow. indeed, if my analysis is correct, there is a sizable meeting ground where it is difficult to distinguish the statistician from the subject matter specialist.

Bradley","1970-1999","the future of statistics as a discipline is discussed as are ways to enhance that future. the presentation includes sections on statistics as a discipline, recruitment into the discipline, training in statistics, the unification of statistics, and concluding remarks. the nature of statistics is reviewed with reference to the views of various practitioners of statistics. it is noted that public attitudes to ward science and statistics are not conducive to the recruitment of students to the discipline and that anticipated shortages of personnel must be met by vigorous efforts to attract the best young people to statistics. suggestions are made for improved training in statistics and for broader programs in continuing education. it is noted that research in statistics should deal both with topics motivated by problems of the real world and with the foundations of statistical inference. specific recommendations are made that should strengthen statistics in the future and lead to its continued unification. the statistical association, enlisting the co operation of other statistical societies, is seen as the major means of ensuring the future of statistics as a discipline. the asa must provide the leadership required and represent the discipline to society. key words: presidential address; statistics as a discipline; training; research; statistical societies. i would not be here tonight except for the influence of one man, professor emeritus george l. edgett of queen’s university, canada. for many years he was the only teacher of statistics at his institution and he encouraged a remarkable number of undergraduate mathematics students to pursue advanced study of statistics. i was one of them. it was appropriate that he was elected a fellow of the statistical association (asa) some years ago in recognition of his teaching. i am here tonight also because of the example, encouragement, and support of many friends in statistics as well as of my wife and family. i would like to express my gratitude for the inspiration of all, particularly w. g. cochran, harold hotelling, gertrude cox, p. l. hsu, boyd harshbarger, h. 0. hartley, and s. s. wilks, not all of whom were my former teachers. professor cochran was for many of us a model of a distinguished statistician able to bring the tools of mathematics to bear on real problems of applied statistics. a special session in his memory will be held at this meeting. we are reminded of the contributions of professor wilks through the 1981 wilks memorial medal awarded to holbrook working here tonight. presidential addresses have changed through the years from technical presentations to discourses on selected aspects of our discipline and association, perhaps to the relief of many members of the audience. i have heard nearly 30 of them and have reread some in preparation for this evening. the rereading may have been a mistake, leading me to the impression that one can only reassemble a subset of a finite set of ideas into a new combination. nevertheless, it is apparent that there is a resurgent undercurrent of concern for the fractionation of statistics into specialized disciplines, for widening gaps among them, and, after 142 successful years of the asa, even for the identity of the discipline itself. my presentation centers on the preservation of the integrity of the discipline and future actions and activities that will permit us, individually as statisticians and collectively as the american statistical association, to continue to serve society. statistics as a discipline much has been written about statistics as a discipline, a science, and a profession good examples are the articles by kish (1978) and hartley (1980). all of us here would agree with these descriptions, but we would begin to disagree on elaborations, thus showing diversity of interest that can be both beneficial and divisive. statistics has been called a mathematical science by some and an applied science by others. if statistics is a mathematical science, it stands alone as the one that postulates models for natural phenomena that must be subject to observation, verification, and refinement, the very process of the scientific method. if statistics is an applied science, it differs from other applied sciences that utilize the theoretical discoveries of science in the production of new products that serve man. statistics as an applied science is applied in the service of science itself; it serves as a tool in other scientific investigations. i believe it is this role of statistics that attracts and generates the dedication of its practitioners. we all see our discipline a little differently, depending on our talents, training, and circumstances. martin (1981) looks at statistics as product rather than method and sees statistics as the process of producing and summarizing large data sets for the use of others, the principal functions common to large government statistics bureaus. , it encompasses not only statistical methodology as a tool, but the whole gamut of activities that musi be performed planning, collecting, analyzing. and disseminating data. the practice of many of these functions is not based primarily on statistical science or methodology but is an art. based on a mixture of intuition, experience. and judgment as well a!, scientific evidence or procedures. kish (1978) contrasted statistics with other sciences: statistics is a peculiar kind of enterprise of contradictory charactei because it is at the same time so special and so general. statistic!; exists on/v at the interface of chance and empirical data. the: data of other scientists comes chiefly from their o w n disciplines. in stark contrast, statisticians have no field of their own from which to harvest their data. , , , because we have n o field of data of our own we cannot work without others, but they also cannot d o without us or not very well. or for very long. hartley (1980) discussed the recognition of uncertainty in modern science and said: statistics is part of this modern scientific outlook of uncertainty. its theory can be appropriately described as “the mathematics of uncertainty.” the deterministic world law from which all phenomena can be exactly predicted is abandoned. kish saw also the philosophical side of the discipline: in all her (his) endeavors the statistician cannot avoid the basil: philosophical problem of empirical science: to make inferences from limited sets of empirical data to large finite populations and to infinite superpopulations of random variables induced by causal systems. a closer link between the disciplines of statistics and the philosophy of science, at least in joint seminars, would be stimulating to both. mahalanobis (1965) viewed statistics as a key technology in national development. how do nonstatisticians view statistics as a discipline? can the answer ibe not at all or almost that? the july 4, 1980 issue of science (vol. 209, no. 4452), a centennial issue, contains articles ranging from “present and future frontiers of the sciences” to the “interaction of science and technology with societal problems.” statistics is not mentioned anywhere as a discipline. an article in the centennial issue by miser (1980) on operations research and systems analysis notes that a comprehensive study of an air quality issue could demand not only research analysts and meteorologists but also demographers, economists, statisticians, and others. maclane (1980) writes on the present and future frontiers of mathematics, but neither probability nor mathematical statistics is mentioned. simon (1980) stresses the importance of good data collection methods and good data, gives l. j. savage credit by reference but not by name for the concept of subjective expected utility, and devotes some space to game theory. one may infer that he gives social scientists credit for improved data collection. articles on engineering, industrial research, food and nutrition, demography, energy, environment, and information resources mention computing, but make no real references to statistics although they present data and refer to costs and benefits, assessment of risks, and threshold limits of toxicity. statistics is more involved in science than the centennial issue of science suggests. the asa has formed advisory committees upon requests from various agencies of the federal government: the census advisory committee, the ad hoc committee on energy statistics, the ad hoc committee on nuclear regulatory research, and the committee on statistics and the environment. (for 1981 committee memberships, see amstat news, no. 72, february 1981 ) one of my first actions as president was to appoint, on the request of the bureau of the census, a second committee led by margaret martin to advise the bureau on technical aspects of the estimation and distribution of the undercount in the 1980 census. other committees of the asa (associated with government statistics) contribute also; they are concerned with law and justice statistics, statistical standards, policies on federal statistical positions, small area statistics, pri vacy and confidentiality, and problems of incorrect polls and abuses of polls. philip handler, president of the national academy of sciences, has recommended the establishment of an office of science headed by a chief scientist in the environmental protection agency and i have endorsed his recommendation. he stated that the chief scientist should have outstanding abilities in statistics, data management, quality assessment, scientific measurement, evaluation, and usage. members of the asa represent our association in many other organizations and on their committees. our members individually support our discipline in science in diverse ways. it is a major strength of statistics that it is represented with dedication and even evangelical zeal. what then is wrong with statistics and what should we do for its future? the contributions of statisticians to science in contrast to the philosophy of science are secondary ones. we act as collaborators in the scientific enterprise. it is hoped that our role is a collegial one, and we can contribute to investigations, usually conceived by others, from their planning stages to their definitive conclusions. are we too willing to attempt salvage operations late in a project‘? how often is data analysis a salvage effort‘? are we too servile‘? as bross (1974) urges, let us be scientists and not shoeclerks. do statisticians as individuals and statistics as a discipline receive appropriate credit for their contributions? several years ago a brochure on statistical consulting, stating abstractly the expectations of both the consultee and the consultant, was developed by the statistical consulting center of the florida state university. i proposed the title, “consult ing etiquette,” which was not used. such a brochure. setting forth abstractly policies on use of data, confidentiality, acknowledgments, authorships, and related matters, can be most helpful in providing a basis for easier decisions in special cases. my first recommendation is the following: 1 the statistical association should develop a brochure on policies and procedures in statistical consulting in service to the discipline. required courses in statistics are among the most feared by graduate students from other disciplines. yet, after successful completion of such courses and appointment to professional positions, a surprising number of these individuals confidently act not only as their own statisticians but as consultants and teachers of statistics to others. in a way visible to the public, we see nonstatisticians discussing conclusions from invalid polls or per forming as statistical experts in courts of law. the phenomenon seems peculiar to statistics it seldom happens, for example, in mathematics. it is a phenomenon that can discredit statisticians. it is a phenomenon that leads some to see a need for a code of conduct for statisticians, a step towards a licensing procedure. h. hartley in his address said we must convince colleagues in other areas that they would be wasting their time dabbling in statistics in an inept do it yourself extravaganza. and convince them we shall. for we shall not idly look on while our professional identity is being destroyed. let me proceed to some of the means to the retention and enhancement of our professional identity. my belief is that the future of statistics as a discipline depends not on regulation but on how we as statisticians plan for and perform in the future. our future depends on the recruitment and training of talented young people, the quality and relevancy of our research, our uni ty as a profession. and our respect for each other amid diverse specializations. it depends greatly on the leadership and representation of the statistical association. 1 consider these topics briefly in turn, make some recommendations, and challenge you to find solutions to other issues raised. recruitment into the discipline the long run future of any discipline depends on its ability to attract and train the very best young people. the demand for statisticians remains strong in industry. government, and education. graduate enrollments in departments of statistics have decreased in the last several years, particularly of u s students and above the master’s level. the future shortage of doctorates in statistics is only beginning to be apparent because of the several years’ lag inherent in the system. the shortage seems likely to reach a critical level in the very near future. the imbalance between demand and supply results from several simultaneous adverse circumstances and from continuing lack of appreciation of the challenges of the discipline. there is general public disenchantment with science. handler (1980) commented: some of our brightest young people now believe that the unanticipated consequences of technology have tr/rtwdy injected the seeds of inevitable disaster into human affairs. they look askance upon the introduction of any new technology and are fearful. therefore. of further scientific advance. mosteller (1981) notes that a well educated public is needed for support of the sciences and is concerned: in the united states we have seen ;in erosion in education in science and mathematics both in amount and quality. the c it i x n has become less well informed. a s we know from the many studies of the national assessment of education progress. there are public misconceptions of science also. handler discussed risk assessment in relation to energy policy and noted that the penalties of serious energy shortage are far greater than those associated with any available energy technology. the data of table 1 from howard and antilla (1979) show activities ordered by resultant deaths with rankings of these activities on the basis of perceptions of risks of three population groups the league of women voters, college students, and business and professional club members perceptions apparently influenced by biases of the media and peer group emotional reactions. ’ career plans of students entering college are affected by public attitudes toward science and mathematics. there has been a marked decline in the number of students entering the mathematical sciences and increased ’ value5 of the spearman rank correlation coefficient for the rankings of the three groups respectively in comparison with the list order are .527, ,305. and ,643. the coefficient of concordance for the rankings of the groups is ,870. table 2(a) shows the 10 year decrease in percentages of freshmen planning to study mathematics and statistics in contrast with other fields, while table 2(b) shows career plans in percentages for freshmen. the marked decline in national science foundation (nsf) graduate fellowships awarded in probability and statistics in recent years is shown in table 3. career opportunities in modern statistics are not well understood either by the public or by prospective students. statistics is seen as a dreary and drab occupation involved with data tabulation; its role in research in science and social policy is not recognized. statistics is newsworthy when it is in trouble poor election prediction or perceived undercount of minorities in a census. the first course in statistics is often dull and badly taught. britain leads in the introduction of statistics and probability in secondary education and has a new journal, some probable fields of study, by percentage of freshmen planning that field , for teachers of statistics in the schools. we lag behind, although serious efforts are being made by our joint committee on the curriculum in statistics and probability. unfortunately, in the past, most of us have regarded training in statistics largely as postgraduate training and have relied on the recruitment of students from mathematics. some efforts on recruitment to the profession are being made. the not very active committee of presidents of statistical societies sponsors the reactivated visiting lecturer program in statistics and publication of the brochure, careers in statistics. the committee on minorities in statistics and the committee on women in statistics make special recruitment efforts. some chapters of our association have programs to stimulate student interest in statistics. individual administrators of statistics departments actively recruit students to statistics through program brochures and sometimes through visits to col leges and universities. we must do more as an association and as individual statisticians. recommendations (2) to (6) that follow should help. a greater effort must be made at the national and chapter levels to create an awareness of career opportunities. i challenge you to develop new ways of doing this. 3 individual graduate programs in statistics should be more aggressive and actit e in student recruitment. 4. teachers of statistics should provide better insights to statistics as a science in introductory courses, and actively seek prospective statistics majors. graduate students in statistics must be sought, not only among undergraduate mathematics majors but f rom other undergraduate areas such as engineering, the physical sciences, biology, and economics. statisticians in government and industry should d v e b p programs for the identification and support of currently employed individuals nith interest in and the capacity for graduate study of statistics. the demand for statisticians continues. projections have been made by the nsf on personnel needs to 1990 (see amstat news, april 1981, and national science foundation 1980). the study indicates that the supply of scientists will be adequate except that there will be two fields with large deficits of people with bachelor’s and master’s degrees: the computer professions and statistics. in areas with deficits, inadequately trained people are likely to be hired. we must develop continuing education programs to assist these employees to become competent members of our profession, contributors rather than li abilities to statistics. 2. 5 6 training in statistics “a conference on the teaching of statistics and statistical consulting” was held at the ohio state university in november 1980. the large attendance, the papers presented, the quality of the participants, and the discussions that took place indicate the very great interest in the improvement of training in statistics. the need for balance between training in theory and in applications was emphasized as was the need to provide students with experience in the analysis of real data sets and in statistical consulting. a proceedings volume is in preparation and is recommended (rustagi and wolfe 1981). departments of statistics and mathematical statisticians have been charged with being too theoretical, divorced from the real problems of statistics, and interested only in training others in their own image almost a process of cloning. kish (1978) stated our academic statisticians have been nurtured in a fantasy kind that they mistook for normalcy. departments concentrated on turning out academic ph.d.’s. and imported others to f i l l the hungry pipelines. but this is too harsh and, indeed, as i have noted, kish saw the role of statistics in the foundations of the philosophy of science. the pipelines were hungry, and some concentration on training academic statisticians was necessary to develop the training facilities necessary for the future. not all of us were in the extreme right tail of george box’s bimodal, thin in the middle distribution of statisticians. box (1979) envisioned a scale with applied statisticians on the left and theoretical statisticians on the right and suggested that if, alternatively, we aimed at a central target, then we might achieve a single unimodal distribution. this would still. of course. allow diversity. we would have some highly theoretical people in one tail and some highly applied people in the other. but the majority, while having proper theoretical training, might also possess ability and experience in applying what they knew to the solutions of scientific problems. university statistics departments are beginning to take sight on box’s central target, but his desired unimodal distribution may be achievable only as a mixture of two or more distributions. present statistics departments seem likely to contribute a distribution of statisticians better located than before, but skewed to the right and properly so because many new insights are needed in the foundations of statistical inference. balance will be achieved with the creation and merging of a second distribution of statisticians with a mode close to that of the first but skewed to the left. the development of the right skew distribution has received the most attention. universities have done a pass able job in the past in training statisticians for academia. industry, and some positions in government. we shall achieve the right skew distribution if the following recommendations on training are adopted: statisticians should be trained to be scientists. teachers of statistics should instill in their students an inquisitive. scientific attitude and the concept of scientific integrity. students should be oriented to become professionals in an important liable profession. training programs should contain a required central core of sound theoretical courses in probability and statistical inference. students should be motivated toward cooperative research through some training in un area of application of statistics and through statistical. let me elaborate only a little. students can be oriented in science and statistics through a course stressing the role of statistics in scientific inquiry and providing some history of the development of modern statistics. further orientation results from historical references in individual courses. examples set by instructors, and participation in research projects while in graduate school. students need a strong theoretical foundation in statistics and prob ability to understand the applicability of current statistical methodology, to acquire a basis for the formulation of innovative approaches to new applied problems, and to understand future new methodology as a means for growth in the discipline throughout their careers. returning to the bimodal distribution of statisticians. i think that the left hand mode may be further from the desired central target for the unimodal distribution than the right hand mode. also, the desired left skew com ponent distribution of the unimodal mixture of distributions may be more difficult to develop than the right skew one because it has received less attention and may itself‘ represent a mixture of several populations. our section on statistical education sponsored a report on the training of statisticians for industry. i would like to suggest that they ad dress also the issue of training statisticians for what margaret martin has called statistical practice in bureaucracies., perhaps with the help of other interested sections and subsections. let me share a few preliminary thoughts with you or1 the issue. the problem is acute and divides us. we hear complaints that mathematical statisticians use language and techniques that are incomprehensible to applied statisticians and that the journal of the american statistical! association is too theoretical and unreadable. the corn plaints are unacceptable, even though we differ only in degree in our reading difficulties and authors could make more effort to communicate. mathematics is the language of research in statistics and we must improve our skill:; in this basic language. if the left skewed distribution is to have a mode near the desired target, it is essential that applied statisticians also have basic understanding of probability and statistical inference. this may be accomplished through improved training of applied statistics students and through programs of continuing education and self training for those already in the profession. it is not clear that present statistics departments have the expertise for the necessary training. the answer may be in the development o f interdisciplinary programs with departments of economics, demography, sociology, political science, and public; health, in which the department of statistics provides the recommended central training in statistics and probability and in such necessary components of the programs a:j sampling theory. continuing education in statistics must and will receive more attention in the future. in february 1981, the asa board of directors approved a position for a full time director of continuing education and an appointment was made in june. we have made a successful start with short courses on specialized topics in statistics in association with our annual meetings and through an increasing number of conferences and symposia on special topics. i rec ommend the following: 13. pricirity should be given to short courses in basic theory f b r those who havr n o t had the opportunity for s i h training htfiire, c i r s e s rariging from necessary mathematics f o r statistics through muster’s level probability and statistics. some of these courses should be sponsored by the asa parallel to our present annual meeting short courses. the development of other courses by university extension programs should be encouraged. we should develop reading lists u s preparation f o r the recommended short courses and in assistance to midcareer statisticians in sevt ra in irig the discipline of statistics will be strengthened and more unified if we all learn more about the skills and activities of statisticians at the other end of our bimodal distribution. it can become unimodal with new training efforts arid mutual respect. 14. research in statistics the relevance of its research to problems of the real world affects the future of any discipline. if real statistical problem:, are not addressed by statisticians, solutions will be attempted by others. if these others are inept, serious costs could arise, public policy might be wrongly directed, and statistics could be discredited. if they are competent, new subdisciplines may arise in other areas leading to fractionalization of statistics. my remarks on research are largely directed toward relevancy. this does not mean that i dismiss research on the foundations of our discipline or investigation providing new insights on properties of known methodology we must value both. i give some examples of perceived problem areas but do not provide a list of research topics, referring you instead to the excellent article by tukey (1954). many of his topics are still pertinent today, suggesting that he possessed considerable insight; however, insufficient attention has been given to some of his ideas. duncan and clurbin (1980) described the communication gap between theoreticians and practitioners of statistics as a “vicious gap” and went on to say: theoeticians tend to do “desk research.” they often draw their research problems from other theoreticians’ research. not directly from the real world. while the academicians too often fail to enrich their instruction and research with real life problems, practitioners do not formulate and present their problems to those theoreticians who have the time, the know how, and the resources to solve them mahalanobis (1965) regarded mathematics as a tool of statistical theory and real problems as the motivation for new concepts: pure mathematics is indispensable for supplying rigorous logical foundations arid for exploring the limits and refinements of statistical theory but has never given it essentially new concepts or tools. new statistical concepts and methods have continually emerged only ,in dealing with observations in the world of reality. hotellinj: (1940) made an early plea for the recognition of the discipline and saw statistical consulting as a source of research ideas. we do have a relevancy problem in research in statistics. why has it occurred? it is easier to extend or investigate another property of a known statistical methodology than to generate new ideas. research statisticians have become increasingly isolated from areas of application. new computer related technologies have changed data collection in industrial production. faculty members have been faced with “publish or perish” policies resulting in a stream of minor papers and paper splitting. an increasing number of specializations in statistics has created specialty clubs with few members who review and accept each other’s papers for journals. (should editors select both a specialist and a generalist as reviewers?) too many applied statisticians use the workload of statistical consulting as an excuse for failure to do re search and also fail to recognize research problems or to pose them to others. frank wilcoxon was a florida state university faculty member from 1960 to 1965 after a distinguished career in both statistics and chemistry in research and development. he brought with him an array of problems in statistics that he had encountered in his applied work and, through his enthusiasm, soon had a number of us working on those problems. we experienced the stimulation that can be brought to research in statistics by statistical consulting and problems of the real world. as another example, i consulted regularly for some years with mavis carroll and the general foods corporation and a number of my papers were motivated by this consulting. some academic statisticians receive sabbatical leaves. such leaves give them the opportunity to gain insight into relevant research in statistics if taken with industry or government. industry and government would do well to consider a system of leaves for their employees in statistics to give them more time for research on problems they have identified and the opportunity to interest academic statisticians in these problems. exchange and fellowship programs could assist also and i should note that several fellowship programs with government are now managed by the statistical association. any system of leaves or exchanges between statisticians in applied work and academic statisticians can assist re search in statistics and mutual understanding. the following recommendations seem reasonable: 15. academic statisticians should consider sabbatical leaves with industrial or governmental groups in statistics f o r the resulting research stimulation. research and study leaves f o r applied statisticians to permit time f o r research and interaction with theoretical statisticians should be developed. industry and government should provide more consulting opportunities for academic statisticians, since benefits would accrue not only f rom the short term so 16. 17. lution of statistical problems hiit also from the associated long term research that would be stimulated. statistical societies, employers o j applied statisticians, and universities should do inore to develop ex change and fellowship programs in statistics to promote research, mutual understanding, und improved professional qualifications. there are other ways to stimulate statistical research on relevant problems. papers on unsolved problems in specific areas of application could be solicited for national and regional meetings and possible publication in statistical journals. duncan and durbin suggest that journals have a section on practical problems faced by practitioners. just as others have recommended the development of data banks, this leads to the following recommendation: a problem bank in statistics should he developed, possibly with the assistance of the sections of the asa. let me turn briefly from the relevance of research in statistics to the research itself. on the foundations of statistical inference, we continue to have diversity of opinions and doubts as to logical validities. for example, my colleague, basu (1980), concludes that the fisher randomization test is not logically viable. controversies re lated to bayesian inference and classical inference continue to exist. they need to be resolved constructively, perhaps through a generalized theory that may include both. box (1980) has made an initial effort at reconciliation. more consideration should be given to the use of new concepts of inference in applications. an example is the work of hoadley (1981) on a new bayesian approach to use of empirical bayes methods in a quality measurement plan. much needs to be done on the foundations of statistical inference. cooperative effort, not controversy, will help. let me conclude my thoughts on research in statistics with some questions that may affect research. i have emphasized statistics as a science and its role in science, as many statisticians tend to do, and have only mentioned the role of statistics in social policy, a role that should include business decisions as well as governmental ones. statisticians tend to think of the design and analysis of an experiment as an entity in itself and not as a step in an iterative scientific process. does this affect our views on statistical inference? scientific method should include the exploration of data from an experiment for insights that can lead to new investigations. does this affect our views on dependent statistical analyses and problems of multiplicities of analyses? why has there been so much emphasis on diffuse priors in bayesian inference and why have the concepts of decision theory been applied more to properties of estimators and mean squared error losses than to policy decisions? is it simply because priors and loss functions are difficult to define and required information is difficult to obtain and likely to be too subjective in real applications? have we subverted these procedures from their intended purposes? have we failed to under stand that experimentation and statistical analyses con tribute only part of the information that goes into decision making? do current emphases on exploratory data analysis and robust estimation suggest that we should be giving more attention to good data collection? the unification of statistics within the human race, groups form through common origins or interests. perhaps it is indicative of man's in security that these groups attempt to enhance their welfare through establishment of superiority over competitive groups and through a sense of elitism. much of the trouble in the world originates in this way. to a limited degree it even happens in statistics. the belief that there are widening gaps between various and diverse categories of statisticians has led to concern for the future of the discipline. we seek the welfare of the broad group of individuals labeled statisticians and believe this can best be achieved through unification of the various categories of statisticians through establishment and support of common interests in preservation of the discipline. we support the other sciences and i am not recommending elitism. al though we do have a common sense of pride in the accomplishmen t s of statistics the international statistical institute has addressed the unification of statistics through the reports of its committee on the integration of statistics and its committee on future directions, the first referenced to duncan and durbin and the second presented to the is1 general assembly at its 42nd session in manila (international statistical institute 1979). the statistical association has been aware of the problem also. but has approached it less directly, but perhaps more constructively, in its report (1978) of a conference on the transfer of methodology between academic and government statisticians. the report that i cited earher on preparing statisticians for careers in industry contributes also to communication between two categories of statisticians. it does seem that statistical societies provide the major vehicle for unifying statistics and for strengthening the future of statistics as a discipline. our several statistical societies with overlapping memberships have developed to meet special interests. they serve the discipline, its members, and society as they contribute new methodology to statistics. they contribute to the fractionation of statistics as they seek identity and fail to cooperate on issues of consequence to the whole discipline. some years ago, the committee of presidents of statistical societies (copss) was formed to facilitate joint activities. copss has sponsored the visiting lecturer program in statistics, some joint publications, and some special lectures. copss has, however, been weak, and we support the efforts of john flueck, the present chairman of copss, toward its revitalization. the constitution of the asa provides for cooperating or associated societies. i have two recommendations: associated or cooperating societies should be encouraged to cooperate with sections of the asa in the development of programs for regional and annual meetings, in publications, and generally in support of common interests 21. associated or cooperating societies that have no special olignrnent with a section of the asa should be encouraged to contribute to the programs of our meetings and in such other ways as result in mutual benefit. reciprocal participation should follow. the eastern and western north regions of the biometric society cooperate with our biometric and biopharmaceutical sections and provide a model for my first recommendlation. it is my hope that the institute of mathematical statistics (ims) may provide an example of the second. perhaps regions of ims will arrange sessions on the theory of statistics at our annual meeting in those years when we do not meet together, thus filling a serious void in our program. cochran (1954) spoke on the structure of the asa following some experience with the new constitution of 1948. the 1948 constitution encouraged the formation of sections and emphasized associated societies. it is interesting that cochran noted plans for the formation of a fifth section, the section on statistics in the physical and engineering sciences, a membership approaching 5,000 (now nearly ls,ooo), and saw the association as a voluntary, scientific one. in 1981, we have eight sections and two subsections, we have increased the number and variety of our publications, and we should see our as sociatiori clearly as both a scientific and a professional one. our sections and our publications are major sources of our strength. sections provide means of association and intellectual exchange with others with similar interests in statistics. section programs at meetings assure members of sessions in which new ideas on topics in their areas of specialization are presented. on occasion, some sections sponsor special conferences on special topics. more of this should be done. sections cooperate with associated societies and, from time to time, respond to public issues involving statistics or persuade the association to do so. our sections could also become a source of future weakness if their successful development leads to the formation of separate societies. the more specialized journals tend to be associated with the activities of separate sections the planned journal of business and economic statistics was proposed by the corresponding section. the success of the association has led to large annual meetings with competitive, concurrent sessions. this has yielded complaints from members who seem neither to wish to exercise selectivity nor to recognize the stimulation possible from across section interchanges of ideas. there have been suggestions that sections hold separate annual meetings, a very bad idea in my view and a threat to unity. we must work to preserve our present unity and to further the unification of statistics: at one time the florida state university had a last lecture series. the idea was that one should pass on 22. every effort should be made to improve the asa annual meeting3, reducing session competition through good scheduling, the use of poster sessions, and perhaps experimentation with video tapes, but preserving the rights of members to present contributed papers. because of the size of the asa annual meeting, sections should not consider separate annual meetings but should rather meet unserved needs of their members through their own special meetings, meetings with associated societies, and topic oriented conferences. the journal of the statistical association should remain our prestige journal, retaining the goal of publishing the very best articles on the theory, methods, and applications 0.f statistics. other journals of the association, dedicated to more specialized interests in statistics, should remain open to contributions from all and be subject to publication policies established by the asa board of directors. the asa has always been interested in data collection in government, beginning at least as early as 1844 (bradley 1981). this interest has broadened through the years, and asa now reviews the statistical adequacy of major research studies, governmental organization and use of statistics, and appointments to senior governmental positions in statistics. from time to time, the asa has responded to public use or misuse of statistics and arranged for testimony before congressional committees. the statistical association is the only society with sufficiently broad interests and broad membership to en able it to speak for the discipline and to exert influence on public policy. the future unity of the asa is most important to the future of statistics in america. 23. 24. 25. concluding remarks i shall not conclude with a detailed summary. i have discussed statistics as a discipline, how others see it , and some of our contributions. i have no fears for the future of statistics as a discipline if we retain our enthusiasm for the subject, continue to work together, and close the gaps that emerge from time to time between categories of statisticians. we must exert more effort to attract good young people to the profession, to improve training with new continuing education programs, and to stimulate research both on problems of the real world and on the foundations of statistical inference. the asa must provide much of the leadership and this will occur through the ideas, leadership, and service of its members. i hope that sections, chapters and committees of the statistical association will consider my recommendations and act on those with merit. ’ h.o. hartley, in what was one of the last of his many contributions to the asa, prepared an informal report with recommendations for the improvement of the annual meeting, which is now in the hands of the committee on meetings. those important words of wisdom that one would wish to transmit if, indeed, it were one’s last lecture. i did not follow that approach, but, instead, have attempted to share some thoughts that may benefit statistics and our association. i may have followed the stated plan of moser (1980) who, in the introduction to his presidential address to the royal statistical society, said that he would exercise the privilege of presidents and unburden himself of opinions and prejudices. in all of this, i have borrowed from the ideas of others and added but a few of my own. paddy is reported to have said at his hanging that it was remarkable how the thought of it tended to concentrate the mind.4 i hope that the thought of this speech had a similar effect on my mind and that i have not in spired a lynching. let me thank the officers, board, and members of the asa for their support. the often mentioned, dedicated efforts of fred leone, ed bisgyer, jean smith, and the washington office staff make the statistical association what it is today. i wish to thank particularly our past president and chairman, margaret e. martin, for her staunch support and willingness to pinch hit for me from time to time she is a very great person. finally, i am enjoying being your president this year and appreciate your confidence.

1982,"77th","Kruskal, William H.","Male","The University of Chicago","Academia","142nd","August 16–19, 1982","Cincinnati, OH",NA,"Miracles and Statistics: The Casual Assumption of Independence",1982-08-17,"William H. Kruskal","1970-1999","the primary theme of this address is cautionary: statistical independence is far too often assumed casually, without serious concern for how common is dependence and how difficult it can be to achieve independence (or related structures). after initial discussion of statistics and religion, the address turns to miracles, especially hume’s critique and babbage’s reply. stress is given the often tacit or unexamined assumption of independence among witnesses of a putative miracle. other contexts of multiple testimony are treated, and the address ends with contemporary casual assumptions of independence: nuclear reactor safety, repeated measurements, and so forth. other topics include prayer, circularity of argument, and the tension between skepticism about testimony and the pragmatic need to accept most of it provisionally. 1. introduction francis henry egerton, earl of bridgewater,’ died in 1829; in his will he left 8,000 pounds for the writing and publication of works on “the power, wisdom, and good ness of god, as manifested in creation.” under eminent auspices, eight clerical and scientific notables each wrote and published a treatise. charles babbage, progenitor of the modern computer, felt that the eight treatises did not carry their argument far enough, and that at least one of them incorrectly argued that the pursuits of science are unfavorable to religion. in addition, babbage had views about miracles, views in part statistical. so in 1837 he published what he called the ninth bridgewater treatise: a fragment. (a second, revised edition appeared in 1838.) i begin with babbage’s treatment of miracles in his own context, that of hume’s famous argument against testi mony for miracles. then i discuss miracles and testimony more generally, with special emphasis on the ubiquitous, critical, and often tacit assumption of independence among witnesses. i then discuss overcasual assumptions of independence in other contexts. if i have a moral, it is this: do not multiply lightly. miracles are relevant to statistics in a number of ways. one analogy is that miracles are like apparent outliers that we study and worry over. one might even say that miracles are the extreme outliers of nonscientific life.2 it is widely argued of outliers that investigation of the mechanism for outlying may be far more important than the original study that led to the outlier; the discovery of penicillium is often given as an example. just so, for those who take miracles as signs of revelation, the religious import of a miracle may be far more important than the daily life in which it occurred. in the same way, there are misleading apparent outliers and misleading false miracles, the results of poor, prejudiced, or careless observation. if identified as such, these outliers and miracles are worth little attention except for their connections with the psychological vagaries of human observation or with the effects on behavior of fortuitous coincidences. 2. religion and statistics religion and science generally are two basic realms of human effort that can hardly fail to interact and intersect. gilkey (1982) expresses that strongly: “new religious forms appear and reappear out of and because of a scientific, technological culture in response, first, to the demand for a credible system of symbols giving structure, meaning, and direction to nature, history, society, and the self, and, second, to the particular sharp anxieties and even terrors of a technological age” (p. 71). a current example of intersection is the debate about teaching evolution, especially in secondary schools, and gilkey’s article is about that debate. again, the great physicist frank (1956) wrote of how all scientific theories are related to “their fitness to support desirable attitudes in the domain of ethics, politics, and religion” (p. 9). some will be surprised at so normative a statement. i do not propose treating further the broad theme of religion and science, and i certainly will not exhibit aggressive incompetence by dipping deeply into theology. now narrow our focus to connections between religion and the mathematical sciences, a part of science in general. there are many such connections without explicit statistical aspects; i think of a range from astronomical and calendar calculations to recent attempts (brams 1980) to ward applying game theory to biblical stories. one also finds fatuous or superficial uses of mathematical terminology, for example, by francis hutcheson in 1724: “benevolence is directly as the moment of good. again, david hartley writes in 1749 that w = f2/l, where f = fear and l = love of god, and w = love of the world (see stephen 1962, vol. 2, pp. 57 58). such uses have been roundly criticized and also defended as useful metaphors. in the case of john craig, whose 1699 calculation of the date of the second coming has been frequently derided, a recent brilliant interpretation by stigler (1986) provides a sympathetic recasting. in any case, the argument over apparently superficial use of mathematical expressions continues in bitter argument over membership in the u.s. national academy of sciences. if we specialize further, from the mathematical sciences generally to probability and statistics, a number of developments come to mind. as pearson (1924) said, de moivre’s work on the central limit theorem was theological: “he was determining the frequency of irregularities from the original design of the deity. without grasping this side of the matter, it is impossible to understand the history of statistics from de moivre through derham and sussmilch to quetelet, culminating in the modern principle of the stability of statistical ratios” in another place, pearson (1978) carried the sequence of theologically mo tivated statisticians through florence nightingale, and added that “with a modified meaning we might almost add francis galton” (p. 286). indeed, several chapters of the lectures (pearson 1978), especially those dealing with thomas bayes and richard price, are suffused with theological motivations and connections. a different theme is the ancient religious fear of being counted, for example in a census. this appears in several parts of the old testament. for general treatments of religion and statistics). 3. prayer i digress to discuss statistically shaped studies of the efficacy of prayer. these studies are interesting per se, and they bring us near the topic of miracles. for some argue that prayers at any rate answered prayers are in a sense miracles, if often small miracles. yet tyndall(l871) wrote and many others have made the point that no prayer “could call one shower from heaven or deflect towards us a single beam of the sun” without a “disturbance of natural law, quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse” (p. 36). perhaps the first recorded empirical comparative trial of prayer was the competition between elijah and the many priests of baal (1 kings is), although the objectivity of its reporting may be questioned by some. recall that the priests of baal built an altar, put on it a sacrificed bullock, and called on baal to start the fire. nothing happened. then elijah had a bullock put on his altar, poured water over it to make the task dramatically harder, and called on his deity. the response was overwhelmingly fiery. at least one scholar (diet1 1968) has built on this example and proposed randomized trials as an approach to showing that miracles really happen yet another relationship be tween religion and statistics. among relatively recent empirical studies of prayer, the earliest i know was by the great francis galton. he reasoned that the royal family and british clergymen probably generated more british prayers for good health than did others, so he compared longevity of members of the royal family and clergymen with the longevity of others. there are, of course, obvious problems of control and comparability, but galton pushed ahead nonetheless, and came out with negative results that scandalized many contemporaries, perhaps as much for the method as the conclusions. his first publication on the topic was in 1872, and he included the material in his 1883 book the book also had a more general discussion of what galton called theocratic intervention and the possibility of ascertaining it. in the second edition, however, the theometric material was omitted, because said gal ton it offended the sensibilities of a number of readers. i believe that he never returned to the topic the galton (1872) article and other contemporary exchanges were reprinted in the prayer gauge debate (means 1876). [galton’s publication was slightly preceded by tyndall(l871) and henry thompson, but they only proposed studies where galton carried one out.] pearson’s (1924 1930) massive biography of galton describes the study (see vol. 2, pp. 115 117). haldane (1928, pp. 243 245) pro vides a slightly distorted account (wrongly substituting children of clergymen for their fathers), and brush (1974) gives a thorough discusion. a recent medical evaluation of prayer by joyce and weldon (1965) was double blind and inconclusive. another recent study (cullipp 1969) gave results more encouraging to prayer, but its description leaves me with questions. of course there is a long liter ature on the curative effects of faith in various senses; for an overview and entry bibliography, see frank (1978). 4. miracles we turn now to miracles themselves. there is a huge literature on miracles, and i have been able only to dip into it selectively with a primary interest in evidence for miracles, especially the validity of testimonial evidence. begin with david hume’s 1748 definition (see hume 1975) because hume was one of the first6 to apply probabilistic ideas to miracles, and because hume’s famous argument against miracles is framed in terms of one probability out weighing another. hume defined a miracle as “a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent” (hume 1975, p. 115). see pomeroy (1962, p. 6) for variant hume characterizations of a miracle. aquinas had earlier said that a miracle is something done by “divine agency beyond the order commonly ob served in nature.” a more recent definition speaks of a “striking interposition of divine power by which the operations of the ordinary course of nature are overruled, suspended, or modified.” see flew (1967, p. 346) for a highly relevant treatment. every nuance of definitions like the above has been repeatedly examined and analyzed. for example, the idea that a miracle should be striking, remarkable, the resurrection in bright color with a full chorus singing the messiah, has been both underscored and denied many times. hume himself did not see the need for a striking appearance. he said: the raising of a house or ship into the air is a visible miracle. the raising of a feather, when the wind wants ever so little of a force requisite for that purpose, is as real a miracle, though not so sensible with regard to us. (1975, p. 115) other authors might exclude the raising of a feather by insisting that an event must have clear religious significance to be counted a miracle; for example, see swinburne (1970, pp. 7 10). for a discussion in the old testament context, see eichrodt (1967, p. 163). yet it is hard to know what religious significance might mean. eliade (1981) in sists that miracles may appear in the most ordinary parts of everyday life. he says, for example, that “just as i believed in the unrecognizability of miracle, so i also be lieved in the necessity of the camouflage of the ‘ex ceptional’ in the banal, and of the trans historic in historical events” (p. 224). i have difficulty with the unrecognizable miracle, for how can that be a sign or evidence or explanation? for a fuller statement of this point see smart (1964, pp. 48 49). there are also viewpoints that simply take life or science or man as miracles in themselves. “the greatest miracle is the existence of the laws of nature.” or, “all of life is a miracle. when you look at an apple seed, you are really looking at a miniature fruit tree. this is as big a miracle as the news of the resurrection.” these are some quotations from scientists in the god of science, a book7 of interviews with scientists about religion (trinklein 1971, pp. 80 81). prior (1955) says that “faith is an inward miracle of god’s mercy” (p. 8). to be more accurate, the statement is made by a barthian protestant in prior’s imaginary dialogue. eichrodt (1967) stresses that the old testament takes miracles in the “widest possible terms. even the course of nature itself counts as a miracle” (pp. 162 163). an important problem with hume’s definition is that of explicating the idea of “law of nature.” another is to show that an alleged miracle is in fact willed by the deity, or by an appropriate “invisible agent” presumably a benign one, say an angel, as opposed to a demon or devil (see swinburne 1968, 1970, chap. 5). yet i avoid such angelic temptations and hasten on to the central question of testimony about the happening of a miracle. for testimony, in particular allegedly independent testimony from two or more witnesses, forms a central topic of this exposition hume’s discussion of testimony is cynical, skeptical, and full of wit. he concludes that human testimony is so subject to bias, passion, self interest, change over time, and so on, that “no testimony for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability, much less to a proof; and that, even supposing it amounted to a proof, it would be op posed by another proof” from the weakness of testimony for remarkable events (1975, p. 127). hume goes on to say that experience, and only experience, informs us of the validity of human testimony and informs us of the constancy of the laws of nature. when “these two kinds of experience are contrary, we have nothing to do but subtract the one from the other this subtraction, with regard to all popular religions, amounts to an entire annihilation; and therefore no human testimony can prove a miracle, and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion” (1975, p. 127). one can try to formalize this argument in several ways, comparing two explanatory hypotheses about a reported miracle, say the changing of water into wine or the levitation of a holy anchorite. hypothesis his that the miracle really happened, so the report is correct, putting aside questions of volition by a deity or other invisible agent. hypothesis ?? is that the miracle did not happen and that the reporter (perhaps oneself) was mistaken, tricked, or even a liar. a fuller treatment might consider the possibility that the report was correct but misinterpreted. there are two sample points, r (the miracle is reported) and r (it is not), to permit an analysis. a likelihood approach might be tried, but it seems not rich enough to include hume’s argument. turn instead to a simple, familiar bayesian structure; after all, miracles usually have a priori improbability. (but keep in mind those everyday miracles stressed by some.) suppose then that 8 is the a priori probability for h, and 8 = 1 8 that for g let p be the _ _ probability of correct reporting: p = pr(r 1 h) = pr(r i h ) let = 1 p then we have a standard 2 x 2 table: r r the familiar central calculation is to write the column wise conditional probability as the unconditional one over the sum, pr(h i r) = p8 / (po + @). note that if p = p = $, then pr(h i r ) = 8 = pr(h), a natural result. even more naturally, if the witness is wholly trustworthy ( p = l) , then pr(h i r) = 1. this formulation may be criticized in many ways. for example, the propensity to lie or be duped is presumably very different if a highly likely event happens than if it does not; a bridge hand of 12 hearts is, i think, much more likely to be reported as 13, than one of 13 reported as 12. thus the value of p might well be taken as different in the two rows. more important, there is every reason to expect p to be a function of 8; the probability of reporting a bridge hand of 12 hearts as 13 is, i surmise, much greater than reporting a hand with 4 hearts as one of 5 (see venn 1962, p. 421). these are psychological and historical questions that cannot be neglected. there seems to be remarkably little discussion of reasonable numerical values for 8 and p in various settings.” at a more fundamental level, we generally do not set up such models until after a surprising event has been reported or at least discussed. thus there is inherent bias of selection in the very act of model formulation. similarly, there is something arbitrary about setting up the two point sample space. coins do land on their edges sometimes, and more often witnesses have their own in between summaries: neither water nor wine, uncertainties about how dead the revived man was, and so forth. in some cases, it makes little sense to look at the probability of a simple event rather than at a tail probability of decreasingly prob able events under one hypothesis. hume argued, as 1 interpret him, that pr(incorrect observation i r ) = pr(h i r ) > pr(h i r ) = pr(correct observation 1 r ) , that is, that pr(h i r ) < f. a little calculation shows that this is equivalent to 6 < p ; that is, the unconditional prob ability of the miracle is less than the probability of a lie (or mistake, or the like). he argues by anecdote, appeals to experience, and explanation of his cynical view of human nature. [that skeptical12 position was not new. indeed it long predates the christian era; see grant (1952) for a detailed history of waves of skepticism and belief. j hume might but i think did not have quoted the skeptical words of shakespeare, who had gloucester say “what means this noise?/fellow, what miracle dost thou pro claim?” (henry the sixth, second part, act 2, sc. 2). still hume put the skeptical case with special force, at a time of developing uncertainties about christianity, and in terms however early and rough of probability. 5. babbage’s reply hume’s argument was met by a storm of protest, much too extensive to report here. [one account is by brown (1984, pp. 89 91).] but i do want to describe babbage’s answer to hume. babbage said, in effect, “david hume, you may be right for a single observer thatis less than p, but suppose that there are several observers, and in dependent ones, who agree in reporting the miracle, that is, in r. isn’t it obvious that, for any fixed>no matter how small, we can find an integer n such that agreement of n independent observers on r will produce a conditional probability for h that is arbitrarily close to l?” well of course that’s right in an algebraic sense provided that p > p, that is, that a correct observation is more probable than an incorrect one. indeed, the conditional probability of h , given that all n independent observers agree in reporting that it happened, is 1 where we assume< 8 < 1. if p > p , then this probability as a function of n is monotone increasing to the limit unity. note that this assumes that p is the same for all observers and not a function of n. it also assumes crucially that the observers behave independently. at the opposite extreme, if the observers behave in a wholly dependent way and give the same answer, the conditional probability is the same as for a single observer. a complication is that p might decrease as n increases, a phenomenon observable at magic shows. under some circumstances, the larger the audience the greater the chance of misobservation. babbage went through calculations similar to those presented previously and concluded as follows: if independent witnesses can be found, who speak truth more frequently than falsehood, it is always possible to assign a number of independent witnesses, the improbability of the falsehood of whose concurring testimony shall be greater than that of the improbability of the miracle itself. the whole of this argument applies to independent witnesses. the possibility of the collusion, and the degree of credit to be assigned to witnesses under any given circumstances, depend on facts which have not yet been sufficiently collected to become the subject of mathematical inquiry. some of those considerations which bear on this part of the subject, the reader will find treated of in the work of dr. conyers middleton, entitled “a free inquiry into the miraculous powers which are supposed to have subsisted in the christian church, from the earliest ages through several successive centuries.” (babbage 1838, pp. 202 203)” not surprisingly, others critiized hume along bab bage like lines. much earlier, price (1777, p. 418) briefly made the point. chalmers (1857, pp. 66 69, 130 135) gave a similar argument before babbage. chalmers excused his “mathematical style of reasoning” because it was “the best fitted to neutralize the mischievous influence superadded to the skepticism of hume by the great name of la place” (p. 66). chalmers also scolded laplace on pages 114 116 and 142 143; i shall return to laplace. price and chalmers are careful to require independence, although i do not see proper discussions of how strong that requirement is. (indeed, chalmers sometimes forgets and multiplies too casually, e.g., p. 122.) in the same way the mathematician james r. young carefully assumes in dependence no collusion, in his language without ex amining the strength of that assumption. young’s calculations are much like babbage’s; a first claim by young (1844, pp. 366 367; 1846, p. 80) is that babbage (1838, pp. 198 199) made a small error in calculation that does affect his main conclusion. in fact, it seems to me that young misread babbage and that the two agree. young’s second claimed advance is more interesting. he points out that both hume’s and babbage’s treatments refer to a specified miracle; in fact, initial reports of mir acles refer to previously unspecified miracles. “suppose, for instance,” says young (1844), that a person testifies to the fact that he saw a dead man raised to life; and that ten other persons with every disposition to deceive, but without collusion, testify to the same thing. now, sup posing that these ten persons were limited within the very narrow range of only ten fabrications suitable to their purposes of deception: the probability that they would all fix upon the particular miracle mentioned is. this development is an early discussion of the familiar statistical problem of selection. it is also an at tempt to get around the hume babbage requirement but of course the primary weakness in young’s argument is the difficulty in establishing the absence of collusion. that some probability is very small says little or nothing by itself, or else every bridge hand would be astonishing. one natural statistical way of formalizing young’s approach is to consider the alternative that, if one of the witnesses in fact saw a dead man raised to life, he would (no matter how much a liar) report it with probability ty > l that leads to a likelihood ratio offor the sample point in which all report the revival assuming independence. the literature on miracles includes much on qualitative consistency among witnesses, for example, among the new testament gospels. a widely read nineteenth century example is the life ofjesus by strauss (1892, e.g., see pp. 742 743). ernest dewitt burton, president of the university of chicago, devoted much of his scholarly energies to reconciling, and (as he put it) finding harmony among, the gospels (e.g., see stevens and burton 1905). more recent related works are mcarthur (1969, which discusses possible dependencies among the gospels, l5 and perrin (1977). 6. other fundamental issues in serious statistical thought about testimony, as about most other applications, fundamental problems may question the relevance of probability ideas at all, or point out ambiguities in framing a model. as venn (1962) put it, “the individual presented himself, and the task was im posed upon us of selecting the requisite groups or series to which to refer him. we have to select the conditions of frequency out of a plurality of more or less suitable ones” (p. 395). in effect, venn shows how p may well depend on the nature of the event in question, thus challenging our ability to set up a usable probability space at all. the point had been raised earlier, for example by chalmers (1857, pp. 140 141) as he chides hume for shift ing reference populations. so the reference set may be questioned, and there are further complications. for example, in surveys with several or many interviewers it may be sensible to regard them as randomly chosen, thus introducing dependence among the respondents interviewed by the same enumerator. in other circumstances, especially with one or two interviewers only, we may decide to regard any interviewer effect as fixed so that there is no stochastic dependence. there is a similar ambiguity in some discussions of covariance analysis where nearby plots of ground in agricultural experimentation are taken to have correlated fertilities on one page and considered as bearing unknown fixed differential fertilities on the next. i think there are epistemological issues16 here that remain to be sorted out. in most of this work there was little reference to empirical evidence and great reliance on a priori simplifying assumptions: independence, equal probabilities over people, and probabilities of error not depending on circumstances. there was eventually a revulsion against what john stuart mill called the “opprobrium of mathematics” (mill 1952, book 3, chap. 18, sec. 3, p. 353; 1973, p. 538), an expression translated into french by bertrand (1888, p. 327) as “la scandale des mathcmatiques.” i hasten to add that there was also work of the era that tried to be more realistic and that dealt carefully with empirical evidence; in particular i cite cournot (1838) and bienaymc (1838). for further discussion see heyde and seneta (1977, especially sec. 2.4, pp. 28 34).17 there was, in any case, a turning against direct probabilistic analyses of matters legal and legislative; only in recent years has such work done far more carefully had a rebirth. yet even today egregious oversimplifications are made in legal settings. a popular example is the notorious collins case, in which multiplication of alleged probabilities of characteristics was casually done; see fairley and mosteller (1974) for citations and a tolerant ex position. an extensive discussion in the legal literature, with many references, is mccormick (1972, pp. 491 499). see also the exposition by eggleston (1978), in which the assumption of independence is carefully stated, but as a kind of incantation without due attention to its strength and the difficulty of confirming it.ls 8. recapitulation i pause to recapitulate. starting with questions about testimony for miracles, we have seen that one central issue is that of independence or alleged independence among witnesses. we have traced briefly the historical development of models for testimony generally, including testimony in judicial circumstances. before turning to contemporary examples, one may well ask why the assumption of independence is so widespread. one answer is ignorance. many otherwise estimable people will write that, for example, “the combination of these two probabilities that the core will dry out under accident conditions and that safeguard systems will fail to reflood the core is the product of the two individual probabilities, or 1 in 1 million” (lapp 1974, p. 72). far more important than simple ignorance, in my opinion, is seductive simplicity: it is so easy to multiply marginal probabilities, formulas simplify, and manipulation is relatively smooth, so the investigator neglects dependence, or hopes that it makes little difference. sometimes that hope is realized, but more often dependence can make a tremendous difference. there are intermediate positions in the constant tension between verisimilitude and implicity. a grand theme in the development of stochastic models is the assumption of conditional independence, with the condition often turn ing on unobserved, hypothetical variables. two examples are factor analysis and latent structure theory. in my view there is a central obligation to face squarely 7. france before coming to contemporary examples, i turn back to french thought. starting with condorcet and laplace especially in the latter’s famous philosophical essay calculations something like those sketched earlier for testimony to miracles, decisions about law court cases, and deliberations of legislatures. study robustness of conclusion against mistakes in a priori assumptions of in dependence, conditional or not.” 9. contemporary examples over easy acceptance of independence, and struggles with the complexities of not assuming it, continue about us. i give a few examples beyond those already mentioned, starting with accidents. estimates of accident probabilities in nuclear reactors are important, and much in the news. the difficulties of making those estimates, as with other low probability accidents, turn on the relatively few serious accidents ob served and on uncertainties in setting up physical models for events leading to accidents. the temptation to assume independence at various points must be strong; otherwise how can one get on with the job? most accident analysts understand, of course, that one cannot safely multiply marginal probabilities. for example, after explaining multiplication under independence, bethe (1976) says that one cannot always do that: “there can be ‘common mode’ failures where one event triggers two or three failures of essential elements of the reactor; in that case the probability is the same as that of the triggering event, and one does not get any benefit from the multiplication of small probability numbers. the prob ability of such common mode failures is of course the most difficult to estimate” (p. 25). exactly so. in fact many accident pathways are in between independence and complete dependence. one faces the difficult choice between simplifying assumptions the simplest is independence and inserting guesses about many complex conditional probabilities where direct empirical evidence is non existent or tenuous. or arbitrary averages of extreme possibilities may be taken; for a critical analysis of that approach, see lewis (1980, p. 61). it is not difficult to find a variety of statements at different levels of care. deffeyes and macgregor (1980), for example, give the classically ingenuous form: “the prob ability that an ore deposit will be formed is determined by multiplying the probabilities that each essential ingredient was present” (p. 68). swerdlow (1979, pp. 529 530) takes a contemporary historian of astronomy to task for naively multiplying probabilities. lorenz (1974) recognizes the need for independence, but passes lightly over judging it: “the improbability of coincidental similarity is proportional to the number of independent traits of similarity, and is, for n such characters, equal to 2” l” (p. 230). he refers to striking re semblances in shape of, for example, a shark, a dolphin, and a torpedo. other examples may readily be found in both ordinary science and exotic areas, for example, estimating the probability of extraterrestrial life or the prob ability of a world war next year.21 estimating probabilities like the latter two stretches to the limit perhaps beyond it the appropriateness of probabilistic ideas. how important dependence can be is vividly described by machol (1975) in connection with the sinking of the ss titanic. before the titanic hit an iceberg and sank in 1912, she was declared unsinkable because of her double bottom hull and watertight compartments. unfortunately the ice berg cut a 300 foot gash on one side that flooded five adjacent compartments. in addition, the radio operator on a nearby ship was asleep, the titanic was going too fast, and there were insufficient lifeboats. it is ironic that machol took the other side in a debate with the late j. kiefer in an entirely different domain, the taxonomy and classification of mushrooms. machol, together with r. singer, had strongly suggested assigning mushroom species to genera in accord with pseudolikeli hood ratios formed by multiplying marginal probabilities of characteristics (like having amyloid spores or having an intermediate lamellae width). the procedure, which was called by healy (1979, p. 169) in the medical diagnosis context “idiot’s bayes,” is in fact the correct bayes assignment procedure if all indicators are assumed independent. healy points out that the idiot bayes procedure sometimes works surprisingly well, but kiefer (1979) vigorously argues that responsibility for showing that it works or not is the proposer’s rather than the reader’s. kiefer’s analytical and critical article appeared in the mycological literature; it contains a full bibliography. machol replied in 1980. in the earlier discussion of r a y e r , i mentioned natural continued interest by the bishops of the church of england. a recent episcopal statement about religious belief (house of bishops 1986) deals in considerable part with miracles and testimony for them. it is explicit about dependence and independence, but its usage is, i think, somewhat vague. thus, for example, it says that “if we bear in mind the dependence of matthew and luke on mark, there are only two independent witnesses in the new testament to the institution of the eucharist, namely mark and paul” (p. 28). why mark and paul are taken as independent is not made clear. the same vagueness may be found in some historical literature, for example, garraghan (1946, pp. 294 295 and elsewhere) as cited somewhat misleadingly by burns (1981, p. 296). both of these books contain much material relevant to our discussion. we see then some of the traps in gratuitous or casual assumptions of independence. a grand irony is that in dependence seems rare in nature, and when we really want it, we go to great pains to achieve it, for example in the production of pseudorandom numbers for selective service lotteries (see fienberg 1971), and in randomization for allocation of treatments in experiments. (these two cases are not, strictly speaking, aimed at full independence be cause of their without replacement structure; the central point is that they are aimed at joint distributions of known form for the sample point. in fact those known forms are usually closely related to random sampling.) in most real cases there is noticeable dependence be tween phenomena. we are surprised, for example, when social psychologists working with sentiments of contentment find little or no association between putatively polar traits of positive happiness and negative discontent. similarly putatively polar traits of stereotypic masculinity (self confidence and competitiveness) versus stereotypic femininity (gentleness and concern for others) turn out to be almost vanishingly correlated given sex. [cautionary comments: (a) weak correlation is not the same as independence; (b) the averages differ in standard stereotyped ways.] an almost universal assumption in statistical models for repeated measurements of real world quantities is that those measurements are independent,22 yet we know that such independence is fragile. berkson, magath, and hurn (1939), for example, showed how laboratory blood cell counts present surprising correlations. repeated measurements by the same observer are bound to be affected by memory of prior observed values. to avoid that prob lem some measuring devices have arrangements for blind haphazard resetting of the zero point between successive observation. mahalanobis (1947) suggested carrying this further by using different scales for separate observations, each with variant scale markings perhaps even nonlin early related! there is a related substantial literature on process control, in the sense of independent identically distributed observations. much of that literature deals with shifts in expected value, but some discusses dependence. page (1978) gives an excellent overview. so we have come from miracles, through testimony, to inflated or insidious claims of independence and how they can be damaging. i began with charles babbage and i end by quoting william schwenk gilbert, another wise englishman. in act 2 of the yeoman of the guard fairfax asks, “and thou didst see all this?” point answers, aye, with both eyes at once this and that. the testimony of one eye is naught he may lie. but when it is corroborated by the other, it is good evidence that none may gainsay. here are both present in court, ready to swear to him. notes 1. he was the eighth and last earl, a renowned eccentric with family money, largely from the building and operation of english canals. falk (1942) gives a colorful account. the earl’s testamentary intentions were carried out by the president of the royal society, assisted by the arch bishop of canterbury and the bishop of london. see babbage (1838, p. xxi) and barnes (1965, p. 857). 2. a philosophical discussion of the relationship between apparent miracles and “irregular or discrepant fact[s]” generally is given by mckinnon (1967, pp. 312 313). 3. it may be an oversimplification to regard answered prayers as small miracles. for example, chalmers (1842) has an ingenious distinction to explain the apparent inconsistency between the efficacy of prayer (taken for granted) and the observed uniformity of nature, save for the few “well accredited miracles of the jewish and christian dispensations” (p. 237). chalmers pointed out that we are unable to trace causative chains in nature back for more than a few steps, and that prayers are answered by unobservable divine intervention further back in the chain. real miracles those exceedingly rare events arise from obvious, visible divine intervention. the same distinction had been made by chalmers earlier (1857, pp. 149 150). he did not hesitate to repeat a favorite theme, and i note further that he wrote the first bridgewater treatise! romanes’s (1874) book stresses the similarity between answered prayers and miracles (especially pp. x, 174 187), treats constructively the dilemma that a proper miracle or an answered prayer seems to tear a hole in received natural law, and argues more or less quantitatively (pp. 265 266) against galton’s empirical analysis. part of that analysis shows that clergy live about two years longer than lawyers and doctors; romanes says that only a fraction of prayers by clergy are truly sincere, say half, that only a fraction of those are for clergy, say half again, and that only half of the remaining prayers are for length of life as opposed to other boons. multiplication gives an eightfold dilution, and multiplying again two years by eight provides an effective advantage of 16 years! romanes, to be sure, recognizes the gaps in this counterargument and says that he gives it to show “that the statistical method is not a trust worthy instrument with which to gauge the physical efficacy of prayer” (p. 266). romanes’s thinking about religion fluctuated, probably under the influence of charles darwin. an account of perhaps questionable accuracy is given by romanes’s widow (1908). 4. the omission, according to pearson (1924 1930, vol. 3b), was at “the urgent request of the publishers” (p. 448). in his preface to the second edition, galton describes the omission ambiguously, but plainly says that he finds “nothing to recant” in the omitted chapters. 5. there was a use of the prayer gauge idea by stead (1891) in his article about a then current scandal centering on albert edward, prince of wales, and alleged cheating at baccarat. stead calculated that at least a thousand million prayers for the prince of wales had been made during his life, only to have him become the object of a virulent press attack over card cheating. benson (1930, pp. 211 213) gives a lucid account of the incident, but he puts stead with the attackers when in fact stead is sympathetic toward the prince if not to the effectiveness of prayer. stead explains the prince’s superficial life as the consequence of boredom and lack of serious responsibilities. turner (1974, pp. 59 63) describes another controversy focused on the prince of wales and prayer this one about serious illness and his recovery. turner’s article provides valu able further discussion about the argument over efficacy of prayer. in recent years there have again been british commentaries on possible relationships between prayer and healing, commentaries published under eminent and established auspices (see archbishops’ commission 1958; british medical association 1956; ramsey 1971). i have noted no ref erence in these publications to chalmers’s explanation, galton’s analysis, or the prayer gauge debate otherwise. there are c yet perhaps deep of the british medical association report by the archbishops’ commission (especially in the latter’s chapter 3). debate about miracles continues within the church of england. in particular, i cite the church’s (1986) report of the church of england bishops; it arose after york minster was set afire by lightning soon after the consecration there of now bishop david jenkins, who had been outspokenly skeptical about the fundamental christian miracles. two descriptive statements are by thomas (1985) and kramer (1985, pp. 80, 86 89). a strongly pro miracle viewpoint is given by berry (1986) to gether with many further references. in the context of dependence among witnesses, i shall return later to a 1986 statement by the house of bish ops. 6 not literally the first. brown grier (northern illinois university) has collected other examples, of which an unusually interesting one is the work of hooper [1689 (especially chap. 4), 16991 on transmission of human testimony. the centrality and persistence of hume’s argument nonetheless makes it a good point of departure. as stephen says “the fact that the argument is being answered to this day proves that its efficacy is not exhausted. every new assault is a tacit admission that previous assaults have not demolished the hostile works” (stephen 1962, vol. 1, chap. 6, sec. 1, p. 262). burns (1981) treats predecessors of hume; see pages 10, 59 60, 75 (about annet), 77 (woolston), 89 (wollaston), and 90 95. [annet’s treatment (1744, especially p. 64) is striking, although it lacks even the rough probability idea that hume uses. annet stresses the shrewd point that, if a miracle worker really had the power to change nature mar velously, he might ips0 facto, and much more simply, deceive the senses of witnesses.] burns gives a systematic outline of hume’s several argu ments about miracles; i discuss primarily the argument based on testi mony and probability, called by burns the a priori epistemological ar gument. 7. marty (1977) calls the trinklein book “obscure and almost naive.” trinklein, says marty, approached a “rather random sample of presti gious scientists the opinions he heard were as varied as those from 38 randomly selected patrons of any friendly neighborhood tavern” (p. 31). 8. before going on, however, it is worth mentioning again the pos sibility of extraordinary events that are not miracles; this may be called, following hume, the indian prince question. a south indian prince, says hume (1975), is told that water becomes hard and solid when the temperature goes down enough. the parochial prince, continues hume, ought to be skeptical and require strong testimony, but the alleged aqueous behavior is “not contrary to his experience [but rather] not con formable to it” (pp. 113 114). he simply had never observed water at low temperatures. the example goes back at least to john locke in 1690 (see locke 1959, chap. 9, sec. 5) in terms of the king of siam. something like that is the story of meteorites, whose existence was at first denied for years (see westrum 1978). there is an apocryphal hume like an ecdote about thomas jefferson: when informed that two yale professors had reported a meteorite fall in 1807, jefferson is said to have remarked that “it is easier to believe that two yankee professors would lie than that stones would fall from heaven” (mason 1967, p. 429). whether ball lightning really exists has been questioned for years (garfield 1977; stew art 1878, p. 403; uman 1982, p. 535). the stewart discussion deals explicitly with supposedly independent observers. of course these ex amples can be more than matched by many cases of false, tendentious, hallucinatory, and so forth observations of apparently extraordinary events. most of these would not be called even potential miracles by most miracle enthusiasts, primarily because there is little religious rel evance in ice, meteorites, ball lightning, and the like. 9. a basic divergence in the literature on miracles corresponds to the age old debate about free will and divine intervention. to put it crudely: did the creative divinity start the universe in a grand design and then simply sit back and watch it spin? or does divinity tinker and interfere from time to time by suddenly introducing miracles? babbage (1838, pp. 32 49, 168 171) seems to take the first view; he regards miracles as preordained apparent shifts in natural law, but not real shifts rather, parts of a more general law. his analog is to a com puter program that gives the sequence of natural numbers for a thousand years and then suddenly shifts to another sequence in obedience to initial programming. mill argues that the encompassing law of nature concept does not give a reasonable interpretation for miracles (mill 1969, pp. 473 478). mill says that a miracle “must be produced by a direct volition, without the use of means; or at least, of any means which if simply repeated would produce it” (pp. 224, 474). some thinkers seem to take both viewpoints at different places. an example is maimonides; see hartman (1976, pp. 157, 251) and heller (1958). in maimonides’s (1%3) guide ofthe perplexed the general law viewpoint is taken on pages 480 484, but the more traditional interven tionist position appears on pages 178,498 499, and 528 529. for theologians who regard creation of the universe as timeless, or outside of time, the problem disappears, but fresh problems may then arise. for example, how can one reconcile a timeless universe and the specifically historical character of christianity? 10. hume used the concept of probability in a rather rough way. for discussions of the state of probability at or before hume see burns (1981), van leeuwen (1963), and peirce (1958, pp. 305 306). see also sobel (1987) and owen (1987) for relevant material, especially on bayesian interpretations of hume’s statements. patey (1984) describes the devel opment of probability concepts. 11. there is a sparse but extended literature presenting algebraic for mulas for truth and testimony under various conditions. an excellent critical summary is by zabell (in press). 12. one theme of this essay has been a skepticism about testimony; indeed, statisticians along with lawyers, historians, and others by in clination and training listen with special caution to human testimony. yet i must comment in passing that all of us take most testimony at face value most of the time. we could not otherwise carry on our lives. locke (1959, book 4, chap. 15, par. 6) pointed out in 1690 the dangers in accepting opinions of others: “since there is much more falsehood and error among men, than truth and knowledge men have reason to be heathens in japan, mahometans in turkey, papists in spain, prot estants in england, and lutherans in sweden” (p. 638). yet locke’s editor, alexander campbell fraser, writes in a footnote that we “cannot dispense with the authority of experts and, in many cases, dependence on men of higher intelligence and larger experience than our own is the most reasonable means we can use of the attainment of truth” (p. 638). however sensitive we are to the vagaries of testimony, we simply must accept most of it, at least provisionally. we have neither time nor energy to check more than a little of what we have been told or read. that is certainly true of daily life. in scientific life, it is impossible for each of us to recapitulate more than a tiny fraction of other peoples’ observations. even in mathematics there is an analog: the most energetic and stringent mathematician cannot check and confirm more than a small fraction of statements and proofs in the mathematical literature. as mill says, “authority is the evidence on which even the wisest receive all those truths of science, or facts in history or in life, of which they have not personally examined the proofs” (mill 1969, p. 407). thus profound, persistent skepticism would make life impossible. i find that paradoxical and puzzling. 13. hume in fact refers to multiple witnesses at several places in his essay (e.g., hume 1975, pp. 112, 116, 121) but the references are brief and in passing. swinburne (1968, 1970) picks up the multiple witness point and wonders whether hume has overstringent standards of evi dence. middleton’s book was widely influential; it is discussed, for ex ample, by stephen (1962, vol. 1, especially pp. 222 230). i do not, however, find the question of independence addressed by middleton. 14. there were also restatements of hume’s argument, notably by mill (1885, pp. 217 241; 1969, pp. 470 489), who includes a bitter pas sage (pp. 236 237; 479 480) on the weakness of testimony for the biblical miracles. venn (1962, chap. 17) took a dim view of probabilistic calcu lations about the veracity of joint testimony. a major reason for his skepticism was that “practically our main source of error and suspicion is the possible existence of some kind of collusion. since we can seldom entirely get rid of the danger, and when it exists it can never be submitted to numerical calculation, it appears to me that combination of testimony is yet more unfitted for consideration in probability than even that of single testimony” (p. 428). jean jacques rousseau earlier presented a skeptical approach to such calculations, presumably not in terms of explicit probability calculus. in “the creed of a savoyard priest,” he asked: “who will venture to tell me how many eye witnesses are required to make a miracle credible? what use are your miracles, performed in proof of your doctrine, if they themselves require so much proof?” (rousseau 1911, p. 263). a nineteenth century eloquent supporter of the biblical miracles and their central importance for christianity was richard trench. it is wryly ironic that his views about multiple witnesses should undercut the ar guments put forward by other critics of hume. trench (1860) wrote that “however many they [the witnesses] may be, they are always but a few compared with the multitudes who attest a fact which excludes their fact, namely, the uninterrupted succession of a natural order in the world” (p. 61). trench’s discernment is in any case questionable. he asserts, for example, that people are lighter when awake than when asleep, as first observed by pliny and verified by “every nurse that has carried a child” (p. 232). another curious trench position is suspicion about vari ation among authoritative accounts of historical happenings, exactly the opposite view to that expressed by most defenders of the biblical miracles (that variation in accounts is natural, human, and increases credibility; p. 233). 15. there is a related literature about surprising degrees of agreement among the fathers of the church daillc in effect discusses dependence among the views of the fathers, and even draws analogies to contagion of illness. in the last chapter of his book, however, he seems to go the other way and argues that near unanimity of opinion strengthens the case 16. alleged circularity of argument is another basic question that arises in various related ways. perhaps the most fundamental way is the vali dation of faith via miracles described in a holy book; the book in turn is validated by the faith. as matthew tindal, an early english deist, wrote in 1730, “it’s an odd jumble to prove the truth of a book by the truth of the doctrines it contains, and at the same time to conclude those doctrines to be true because contained in that book”). yet, on the other side of the fence, one may find such boasts of circularity as the following: the new testament “pretends to contain a divine revelation; and, in support of this high pretension, it gives a narrative of the very facts which constitute the evidence that this pretension is founded in truth.” that statement is by john cook, pro fessor of divinity at st. mary’s college, st. andrews variants of tindal’s criticism come from the internal structure of the bible. frye (1982) asks, “how do we know that the gospel story is true? because it confirms the prophecies of the old testament. but how do we know that the old testament prophecies are true? because they are confirmed by the gospel story the two testaments form a double mirror, each reflecting the other” [from the review by kermode a third circular argument is criticized by mill (1969). mill says, as part of his recapitulation of hume, that “the existence of god cannot possibly be proved by miracles, for unless a god is already recognized, the ap parent miracle can always be accounted for on a more probable hypothesis. once admit a god, and the production by his direct volition of an effect is no longer a purely arbitrary hypothesis [and] must be reckoned with as a serious possibility” (p. 477). in vulgar brevity, god implies miracles implies god. mill points this out again when he writes, “all, therefore, which hume has made out is that no evidence can prove a miracle to anyone who did not previously believe the existence of a being or beings with supernatural power if we do not already believe in supernatural agencies, no miracle can prove to us their existence” stephen makes a similar point in discussing hume and paley: “when paley calmly says, if we believe in god, there is no difficulty in believing [in] miracles, hume’s answer is plain. if god is the cause of order, belief in him does not facilitate belief in miracles” lewis, in his well known book on miracles, makes a virtue of the circle, without mention of stephen or mill, when he writes “theology says in effect, ‘admit god and with him the risk of a few miracles, and i in return will ratify your faith in uniformity as regards the overwhelming majority of events” lewis’s argument was not entirely new. the famous mathematical physicist g.g. stokes had given a variant: “admit the existence of a god, of a personal god, and the possibility of a miracle follows at once”. for discussion the quotation may remind us not to sneer at what appear obvious circularities of argument. perhaps we are all forced willy nilly into cir cularities that we dignify by calling them “coherences” or “interconsis tencies.” there is, however, this difference, that some of us are willing to examine our own circularities, and some simply deny them without study. other discussions of circularity may be found. the relevance of this subtopic is that it presents a methodological tangle different from those of dependence of testimony and reference set, yet alike in the frequency with which they are ignored. 17. the opprobrium statement seems to have appeared first in the second (1846) edition of mill (1952), although i do not find it in the 1848 edition. following the opprobrium statement, there is a brief, pointed discussion of over simple probability ideas applied to tribunals. for more on mill’s distaste for formalism, including that of french mathematical political thought, used the french legal example as the basis for his critique of casual independence. give a fascinating story of 1867 expert testimony by two great mathematicians, benjamin and charles s. peirce (father and son), during a trial over a contested will. apparently the independence assumption was used cas ually in a context where it could hardly hold. casual multiplication in a legal setting has a literary endorsement in poe’s “the mystery of marie roget” (1904). poe writes that “if the feet of marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of probability that the body was that of marie would not be arithmetical, but highly geometrical, or accumulative. add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear give us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek for nothing further. if only one flower, we seek for nothing further what then if two or three, or more? each successive one is multiple evidence proof not added to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands” (pp. 285 286). 19. there is also a somewhat aloof mathematical viewpoint that simply avoids the verisimilitude questions emphasized here. for example, writes that “statistical independence, once a shadowy partner of gamblers, experimental scientists and statisticians, has achieved the respectability that only an ancient discipline like number theory can bestow” (p. 72). 20. perhaps one reason for misunderstandings about independence is inadequate training in classrooms and lectures. in a modest probe, i looked at two issues of the journal of the statistical association and counted 11 reviews of introductory textbooks. i inspected the six of these books in our library and graded their treatments of independence tolerantly: no a’s, one b, two c‘s, one d, and three fs, an unhappy record. among the problems with treatment of independence in these books, i cite first difficulty in even finding the independence discussions: indexes were absent or skimpy, and in some cases i gave up after a fruitless search of the index and table of contents together with rapid reading in likely chapters. when treatments of independence were given, they tended to be definitions plus a few simple combinatorial examples. with luck, there might be mention of independence for random variables and observations. in at most one of the books was there anything ap proaching responsible concern for what happens when there is depen dence, how to recognize it, what analytic options there are, and so on. 21. an example of extraterrestrial calculation is the correspondence between donaldson and pollard (1980). lyttle (1982) provides an ex ample of the blithe assumption of independence to calculate the probability of accidental launch of a strategic missile. for a fine treatment of the dependence problem in estimating accident probabilities for liquified natural gas transportation see fairley (1977, especially pp. 339 346). related problems have arisen in examination of acoustic evidence about the assassination of john f. kennedy portnoy and petersen (1984) criticize a study of biblical texts for casual assumptions of independence in statistical analyses. one could easily go on. 22. an important exception is the position of de finetti and his fol lowers. the truly basic idea for de finetti is not independence (plus identical distribution) but exchangeability, that is, invariance of the relevant joint distribution under permutations of variables. that option does not affect the primary theme of this paper: to look critically at any simplifying assumption independence, exchangeability, whatever and to worry about consequences when the assumption fails. 23. discussions of such a device for measuring blood pressure. in addition to decreasing or avoiding dependence among contiguous observations, devices of this kind may also decrease or avoid sources of bias and unwanted variation: integer preferences, observer expectations, and so on.

Anderson","1970-1999","1. some words of appreciation proving the functioning of the headquarters staff, and im as a prelude, i would like to offer my profound gratitude for the services rendered by the asa staff. the dedication of this staff to the asa, its members, and the general public is outstanding. 1 would also like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the many amenities provided by my most severe critic and constant companion, my wife, mary. i also wish to thank the asa committees, and especially the chairs, for their service to the association. i am sure that the staff and officers realize that the asa could not function without them. we have adopted a new constitution developed by an industrious committee under the leadership of kathleen lamborn; the asa nctm committee under dick schaeffer is developing precollege teaching materials in statistics; the future goals committee under joan rosenblatt is struggling to come up with a program that is both desirable and salable; tom jabine’s committee on scientific freedom and human rights has persuaded the board to take some strong action and continues to push for more definitive procedures. one of the chief activities during the past two years has been the excellent asa management review con ducted by john corson of the national executive service corps. mr. corson’s diligent, penetrating, and judicious report covered four areas: improving the functioning of the board of directors, reassessing asa’s programs, im proving the structure and outreach of the association. the report and the board’s response were published in the november 1983 the statistician. an asa building and development committee, chaired by ralph bradley and margaret martin, is developing procedures to solicit donations to a building and development fund. the generosity of many of you has resulted in pledges of over $250,000 to date. a consulting firm and a full time coordinator have been employed to develop a “case statement” on the rationale for developing asa programs and t h e need for a new building to support these programs. the committee has now shifted its operation into high gear with fred leone assuming a much more active role. 2. the statistical association i now address my title: “goals: where are we and where should we be going?” the “we” is both the asa and the statistics profession. although these two are intrinsically intertwined, i will attempt to indicate the “wheres” for each. at the present time, the asa has a membership of about 15,000; unfortunately, there has been little change in this total in the last four years. strenuous efforts are being made to find out why old members are leaving and why many statisticians have never joined. to date we have 62 chapters, which should form the backbone of the association; unfortunately, most of them feel they have little impact on our policies, decisions, or operations. efforts are under way to solicit and utilize recommendations from them. on the advice of and i have initiated periodic visits to chapters; i hope that such efforts will be continued. another essential role in asa performance is played by the sections. when i joined the asa in 1942, it had one section: biometrics. we now have 1q sections and subsections to cover specific fields of statistical methods, theory, or applications. an asa member can choose to belong to any number of these fromto all 10. a sample from the 1978 directory of statisticians indicated that about 30% of the asa members belong to four or more. sections or subsections. in order to ascertain from section members their opinions regarding asa activities, it would be useful to know which sections a member con siders to be of prime importance. i have asked the committee on sections to find out from you asa members whether it would be desirable and feasible to list the one or two sections that you consider to be of prime interest; then the business of the section might be transacted by only those members who designated that section as prime. the 1978 directory is a list of members of the asa, the institute of mathematical statistics (ims), and the two north regions of the biometric society (enar and wnar). i am disappointed and chagrined that the ims has decided to issue a separate directory in 1984. i was amazed to find that approximately one third of the members of ims were not members of the asa in 1978. i am pleased that the ims joined us in toronto, but i feel that the two groups do not meet together often enough. this apparently ever widening gap between the applied and theoretical statisticians is of great concern to me. what can we do to narrow this gap? for example, should we have an asa section on theoretical statistics? perhaps we should have an asa section on applied probability, which could serve as the focus for the activities of another group of applied mathematicians who are so important in the development of the statistics profession. i am hoping that the committee on committees can develop a systematic procedure for deciding what continuing committees are needed and the distinct role that each committee should play in asa operations. two other problems with regard to the committees are 1 how can we evaluate their performance? 2. how can the president elect, who fills vacancies on committees, be apprised of who would be willing and able to serve especially the younger asa members? on the second question, perhaps departmental chairmen and division leaders in industry and government should be making recommendations. as the asa increases its number of journals, how do we best serve the membership in its journal selection process? an ad hoc asa committee under bob hogg is now struggling with this so called “unbundling” problem. there have been complaints that the proportion of theoretical articles in our journals is increasing and many industrial statisticians state that the asa is not catering sufficiently to their needs. are these impressions associated with the plateauing of the membership count? the direction we take on these matters can have a profound influence on our profession. your advice is sincerely so an important aspect of our profession in the future will be continuing education. a tremendous variety of short courses, workshops, tutorials, and films was presented at the toronto meeting. there have been protests concerning overlap with the regularly scheduled sessions. should we curtail this overlap? with the rapid changes in science and technology, there will be an ever increasing need for retraining of research personnel. it would seem desirable to have continuing education sessions at the regional meetings and there is strong support to have more frequent regional meetings. it should be apparent that increased activity by the continuing education group will entail a need for increased space and personnel. a most perplexing problem facing the u.s. statistical community at this time is the reduction of federal budget allocations and professional staff for statistical operations. the asa is participating in the activities of two organized groups that are leading the opposition to these cuts: 1. cossa, the consortium of social science associations, has an executive director who issues timely legislative reports on fiscal, legislative, executive, and other relevant federal operations as they affect the social sciences. 2. copafs, a council of 12 professional associations on federal statistics, is now on the last year of a three year pilot program with a full time director. it reviews and monitors federal statistical programs, reports to its members, issues documents and letters of concern, and arranges for presentations to congressmen on specific action. the asa board of directors has approved continuation of this program. the asa appreciates the support of the association for the advancement of science (aaas) at its 1983 annual meeting in detroit of a resolution that presented the need for the maintenance and improvement of federal statistical programs and concluded with the re solve “that the aaas council call upon the administration and congress to recognize the centrality of quality statistical information systems and data bases of strategic national importance concerning the state of the economy and the state of technology, and to insure the existence of a viable, authoritative and independent unit to fulfill the needs for coordinating federal statistics and for maintaining their quality and integrity.” it is essential that we continue and even expand cooperative efforts with the aaas at all levels of statistical endeavor. there has been considerable interaction with the u.s. congress and the executive office of management and budget by individual members of the asa board and other members. senator percy (of illinois) convened a conference on federal statistics and national needs on january 25, 1983, followed by a workshop on the “data needs of america in transition” (with emphasis on the 1990 census) the following two days. the asa committee on law and justice statistics has just been awarded a grant to provide technical assistance to the bureau of justice statistics. the asa participates with the committee on national statistics of the national academy of sciences and a number of other professional organizations to sponsor a biennial symposium on statistics and the environment. one of the most active committees in this respect has been the asa committee on statistics and the environ ment, which has been working with the environmental protection agency (epa) to improve the statistical aspects of its program. a two day short course, “time series,” was offered in 1981 and another, “quality assurance,” in 1982. the office of radiation programs supported five day symposia in 1981 and 1982 entitled “low order radiation and environmental sampling” and “analysis of sampling data: assessment of human exposures and health effects.” one was held in july 1983, entitled “radiation and health,” with financial help from the occupational safety and health administration (osha). 3. the statistics profession but what about the statistics profession? i feel that the time has come to decide whether we should have some form of professional certification and/or a code of professional ethics. an excellent paper, “a professional code for statis icians? some ethical and technical conflicts,” by roger jowell (1981) is followed by extensive discussion. jowell argued for an educational code covering statistical practice and relationships with respondents, funders, peers, and society at large. an ad hoc asa committee on professional ethics, which has been struggling with this problem since 1977, submitted a report containing a set of such guidelines in the february 1983 the statistician. many statisticians strongly supported these guidelines; however, there were a number of caveats. since i tend to oppose attempts to legalize morality, i was impressed by herb solomon’s comments (1983): there are already enough constraints economic, social and legal that operate to keep us responsible in our efforts. the abuses of such systems (of ethical guidelines) would far outweigh any gains. i think the asa should keep on doing what it does well: publish journals, organize meetings, develop chapters, develop educational activities, and render statistical advice to government agencies. the notion of having a court available to resolve matters of individual behavior in statistics is anathema to me. on the other hand, i strongly support some form of certification that an individual has the necessary training to undertake the statistical activities for which he or she is employed. how much longer are we to tolerate the minuscule requirements for statisticians in the state and federal civil services? the requirement for a statistician in the kentucky civil service is a bachelor’s degree with one course in statistics, except that the college education can be replaced by experience in gathering and analyzing data on a year for year basis. a senior statistician has the same requirement plus only two years of experience, whereas a statistical supervisor requires only four additional years of experience. i presume that these requirements are typical of many states. for a gs 5 federal statistician, the requirements are only slightly higher: a bachelor’s degree with two three semester hour courses in statistics and three more courses in mathematics or statistics; however, courses can count as statistics courses if as little as 50% of the course material is statistical methods. experience can substitute for the other course work. advance in grade is based on professional experience or graduate course work, to be designated as a mathematical statistician the candidate need have only two courses in statistics, four in mathematics, and two more in statistics or mathematics. i will discuss two impediments to our efforts to have statistics recognized as a unique scientific discipline. the first is the public’s perception of a statistician as only a number cruncher a compiler of baseball, football, basketball, track, and other sports records, dow jones stock averages, and the like. this was emphasized in two recent peanuts cartoons in which linus presented the horrendous statistics for their baseball team and remarked that “statistics don’t lie.” to which charlie brown replied, “no, but they sure shoot off their mouth a lot.” then charlie asked what they should do next season, to which the unanimous reply was: “get a new statistician.” when janet norwood presents the latest consumer price index (cpi) on television, few members of the audience are aware of the complex statistical tasks involved in producing it starting with the construction of the index formula, then data collection, tabulation, and analysis of results. somehow we need to acquaint the public with the crucial role that statisticians play in this operation. asa’s continuing education department is developing media presentations that will focus on this prob lem; they have been too long in coming. a second impediment to our attempts to establish that we are a unique scientific discipline is the fact that statisticians are not identified in the statistical abstract of the united states (bureau of the census 1981); instead, they are included with the general classification of “mathematicians or mathematical scientists. ” the national science foundation (nsf) is cited as the source for the abstract’s material on characteristics of scientists and engineers, including employment, salaries, and doctorates conferred. this problem was highlighted in some advice we received on information needed in submitting a proposal to the nsf to provide funds to initiate statistical training in the elementary and secondary schools; the main obstacle is the present loaded math curriculum. an article in the issue of business week is entitled “industry’s hot new find: the mathematician”; however, the examples indicate that most of the problems were resolved by statisticians. in preparing statistical materials for precollege students and the general public, we should minimize our mathematical requirements by emphasizing our role in the assessment of chance and variability and their place in scientific, industrial, and governmental affairs. in order to accomplish this, do we need a national society of professional statisticians? there is one for engineers and for many other disciplines. another problem of immediate concern is the difficulty of maintaining viable statistics programs in many of our universities. one is the matter of statistics faculties. in many universities it is very difficult to obtain promotions of faculty members for whom a substantial portion of time is devoted to consultation with graduate students and other faculty members. as a result, much of their re search output is that of a junior author (or simply an acknowledgment) on articles for which statistics is a tool rather than the raison d’etre. one of my sidelines these days is to write letters recommending the promotion of these applied statisticians; however, i should emphasize that this is no invitation for a sudden deluge of requests from department chairmen. if statistics is to remain a viable profession, we must recognize and continue to prod university administrators and other academicians to recognize that statistics is an integral part of the scientific method. the profession cannot afford to break away from the traditions established by such eminent leaders as cochran, cox, fisher, hartley, neyman, and snedecor, for whom statistics was essentially the servant of the sciences. in june, when i returned to iowa state to join in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of its statistical lab oratory, i reflected on the tremendous contribution of its founder, george snedecor, to statistics in this country and the world. in may i revisited my old stamping ground at north carolina state, where six of the old guard have just retired, and pondered on the fact that most of us went there primarily as consultants. i beg our successors to continue that close connection between statistics and the real world of the natural and social sciences and tech nology. another and perhaps even more serious problem is the maintenance of viable graduate student programs. it is becoming more and more difficult to persuade local students to pursue graduate work in statistics, primarily for two reasons: a sharp decline in the number of under graduate majors in mathematics and the burgeoning demand for graduates in computer science. there is a further problem of persuading students to continue to the ph.d. after completing the m.s. ; many industrial and federal salaries for m.s. graduates are almost as large as for ph.d ’ s in order to meet the demand for m.s. and ph.d. graduates in statistics, several courses of action should be 1. increased emphasis on developing undergraduate programs in statistics or the umbrella of mathematical sciences. 2. recruit undergraduate majors in the physical and engineering sciences to pursue graduate work in statistics; although these students will have a good undergraduate mathematical background, it may be necessary to modify our advanced mathematics requirements in order to persuade them to come over to statistics. 3. recruit undergraduate majors in the biological and social sciences; their possible deficiencies in even undergraduate mathematics would almost certainly require modification in our graduate requirements. 4. develop more flexible course requirements so that statistics majors can select a variety of statistics courses and have time to elect courses in operations research, computer science, and the natural and social sciences. 5 develop a consulting program that involves the graduate student. 6. encourage statistical research projects that are de voted to the solution of real world problems. the refusal of some mathematical statisticians to be concerned about the ultimate usefulness of their research and their disparagement of applied research reminds me of the old fable about the man who devoted three years learning to kill dragons and the rest of his life trying to find dragons to kill. we must recognize that most of our graduates will be come consultants in business and government and that our graduate programs should be structured to meet this need. some statements by p. c. mohalanobis (1965) are germane to this discussion. statistics must have a purpose. the time has come to introduce educational programmes appropriate for statistics as a fully developed new technology which calls for the utilization of a wide range of scientific knowledge to help in solving scientific or practical problems. as fisher has pointed out, “a professional statistician, as a technologist, must talk the language of both theoretician and practitioner.” the education of a statistician, like that of other technologists, must have a broad base. 4. some important problems i close my remarks with a discussion of four important societal problems on which statisticians should be focus ing increased attention. 4.1 contamination of the environment ever since i became a member of asa’s statistics and environment committee, it has been apparent that the statistical profession should become much more involved in environmental problems. one of the major difficulties with our volunteer efforts is the lack of time to work on the really complicated problems such as the love canal and dioxin contaminations. perhaps the best we can do in such cases is to recommend outside panel members or individual consultants. whether the asa should do this for private for profit concerns is another matter; the board of directors refused to allow us to become involved with the selection and monitoring of a panel to investigate the relationship between cotton dust and brown lung disease (byssinosis) for the textile manufacturers institute, a decision that i opposed. i have composed three forum articles on this subject in amstat news. in these i discussed the need for a substantial increase in statistical personnel in epa and the deficiencies of its love canal investigation. some of the major problems in the investigation of the impact of pollutants (mainly chemical) on human health are as follows: 1 the minimal detection limits using existing measuring instruments are too large to estimate the cumulative effects of many chemical compounds. 2. the laboratory to laboratory variability in assessed contamination levels often is quite large. 3. information on long term health effects is usually nonexistent. 4. numbers of animals required to detect response to low doses of a relatively low toxicity substance may be so large that experiments must be conducted at very high doses. how do you extrapolate the results based on these high doses to the low doses that occur in practice? should we force more experiments to be conducted at low doses even if they are very expensive? 5 can information obtained from animal experiments be used to make inferences on human subjects? 6. is the incidence of cancer, birth defects, and other health related ailments more frequent in contaminated areas than in noncontaminated areas? a classical controversy is arising over the danger to people for dioxin contamination. p. h. abelson, editor of science, summarizes a number of dioxin incidents (1983): some of the accidents, notably one in 1949, occurred long enough ago that were cancer to be associated with them, it would now be evident. some 121 workers were involved, and while iron clad proof of a null effect is missing, so too is a basis for believing that tcdd (the most notorious of the dioxins) is a dangerous carcinogen in humans. tcdd is highly toxic when administered orally but when bound to soil it does not pose much of a hazard. with time, natural degradation of the chemical will attenuate its presence in the environment. however, he admonishes that tcdd is all risk and no benefit; hence, we should exert every effort to curtail its unwanted production. another current problem concerns acid rain. excellent reviews are presented in science by marshall (1983) and kerr (1983) and by beck, hagen, et al. (1983). the asa will be assisting the epa in a multimillion dollar nation wide research project on acid rain, the national acid precipitation assessment program. recently, the executive director of the national well water association stated that the threat of our water sup ply is not the crisis headlines suggest (lehr 1983). he believes that “we can eliminate new sources of pollution and put an end to ill conceived toxic dumps within 10 years. the odds are in our favor to end up with 98 percent of our ground water unpolluted at the end of this century.” but this probably is not very comforting to many residents of new jersey, which has 6 of the 20 dirtiest dumps as identified by the epa in december 1982 (beck, junkin, et al. 1983). i hope that everyone saw bill moyers’s frightening 26 july 1983 telecast in which he disclosed the role of organized crime in the toxic waste disposal racket, with special emphasis on the new jersey dumps. abelson’s editorial on waste management (1983) concludes with this remark: “the hazards must and will be minimized, but there will be few quick fixes. drastic action may be required at a few sites, but more harm is likely to come from hysteria than from chemicals.” the same conclusion probably could be made concerning the three mile island nuclear accident. but what can we statisticians do to help separate fact and fantasy in this area? i do not have the answer, but somehow we must devise a more expeditious procedure to become involved. ’ 4.2 quality assurances in industry and government that the united states is in a struggle for its eminence as the leading industrial nation is now well known. one of the most publicized aspects of that struggle is the at tempt to restore quality of product as essential to our success. speaking of industry, i am reminded of the fictitious auto dealer who went into bankruptcy his wife divorced him and he became an alcoholic. as he stumbled in an alley one night, a genie popped out of his wine bottle and offered him one wish. the man said he wanted to be a foreign car dealer in a major city. when he awoke, he was a chrysler dealer in tokyo. it is one of those historical anomalies that we who developed the use of statistical quality control (sqc) as an important part of the world war i1 effort should suffer from its successful adoption by one of the defeated nations in that war. statisticians have been the leaders in advising the japanese on these procedures and are once again being welcomed by industry. perhaps the asa should renew its former close ties with the society for quality control (asqc) in order to present a united front in this effort. we are work ing with representatives from industry, government, and universities in developing a national award for excellence in quality control and productivity. i am hoping that such an award might go to federal agencies as well as to private industries. but this is only the beginning. some of the other needed developments are as follows: america? what about the statistics on comparative mil l promote the development of statistical quality control courses in our statistics departments and engineering and business colleges. 2. develop sqc short courses (and, if possible, longer courses) for government agencies. 3. although many of the major u.s. industries are now employing sqc experts, there may be a need to ascertain whether we should provide assistance to the smaller concerns. 4. provide chapters with speakers on sqc. 5. support the asa section on physical and engineering sciences with funds to develop forums and seminars on sqc and related topics. a typical example was a recent seminar, “statistics, product design, and qual ity control” held at madison, wisconsin. 4.3 federal statistics as i indicated above, one of the tragedies of the recent past has been the diminution of the federal statistical sys tem, especially at top administrative levels. of perhaps even more importance has been the drastic reduction in force (better known as rifing) in such agencies as the energy information administration and the census bureau. the statistical profession must expedite procedures to diminish the chances in 1990 of a repetition of the legal of those legal problems is presented by barabba, mason, and mitroff (1983).

Richard Savage","1970-1999","first, i feel obligated to explain the title, “hard soft problems.” in this context sofr means vague, poorly defined, elusive, or intuitive; hard means precise, analytic, crisp, for mal, or difficult. the history of statistical inference from bayes to neyman pearson has been filled with hard soft problems. the struggle was to clarify what the problem of inverse inference is. the proposed solutions might have been hard to find, but they are clearly solutions. the problems mentioned in the next paragraph and discussed in the following sections are hard soft problems. they have not yet been carefully described for a variety of reasons, including lack of effort, extreme complexity, and secrecy. and even as these problems take shape, their solutions are out of our grasp because of conflicting values, lack of resources, and lack of technical knowledge. for the usual definition of governmental statistical activity, one can obtain a panoramic view of its historical development from duncan and shelton ( 1978) and a current snapshot from office of management and budget (1984). these documents do not focus on the areas of concern in this article. the next section looks at what kind of government statistical activity we have and want. section 3 examines a rational base, cost benefit analysis, for selecting statistical efforts. the federal trade commission’s recent experience with line of business statistics is sobering for cost benefit enthusiasts. the legislation requiring reports on the status of human rights in most countries is a challenge to statisticians (sec. 4). the statistical activities of the department of defense are either in large part kept secret or extremely limited; these uncertainties are sketched in section 5. my comments on these important subjects are meager and tentative; i sincerely hope that members of the profession will further explore these topics. in making this request, i have confidence that i am not asking statisticians to go to realms outside their purview. the reader might observe that my remarks are in large part an expansion of some of the themes of sections 4.3 and 4.4 of anderson’s (1984) presidential address. 2. goals of the national statistical system it is well understood that certain statistical efforts are required by law. the united states decennial population census is a constitutional requirement. although there has been substantial analysis of how to carry out our national statistical efforts, discussion has been technical and has neglected the political aspect. we have not heard enough about what the governed want from the system. first, i will use several quotations to suggest the boundaries of the political issues, and then i will make a few comments on the role of the statistical association (asa) and statisticians in this matter. it is natural to begin with a view, although extreme, often expressed by citizens when commenting on government statistics. but actually, he thought as he readjusted the ministry of plenty’s figures, it was not even forgery. it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. (orwell 1949/1983, p. 37) in this tale, note that the purpose of national statistics is to inform the public; one is left with the impression that the government does not use data for policy analysis. the next view gives a scheme that could be considered for the united states: from a government wide perspective, a fair ordering of statistical priorities would be as follows: ( i ) the census of population, which is required by the constitution; (2) major data series of national economic conditions and social status necessary for policymaking in more than one agency ix., the current population survey, the consumer and producer price indexes, and the economic censuses; (3) surveys necessary for federal decision making but more specific to individual programs or agencies ix., crime and health surveys; (4) statistics necessary to state and local policymaking that can be collected more efficiently at the federal level or in concert with the collection of data used for federal policymaking; and (5) statistics whose principal importance is to discrete private organizations and which can be collected more economically by the private sector or by federal agencies on a user fee basis. (demuth 1983, p. 196) this was a written response to a question from congressman frank horton, prepared by christopher demuth, then the administrator for the office of information and regulatory affairs of the office of management and budget. a central role of this office is to keep a close watch on the continued health of the federal statistical system (demuth 1983, p. 157). unlike orwell, demuth stressed that statistical activity of the government should be for the government. the needs of the private sector, particularly citizens, are at the lowest priority. the final quotation is from remarks made by john keane when he was sworn in as director of the bureau of the census. the bureau doesn’t just collect data, we commence the process for a civilization to flourish through a responding government, economy and society. the bureau doesn’t just compile data, we lend form, utility, priority, and direction to perpetuating our way of life. the bureau doesn’t just analyze data, we inform our country about its heart and, yes, about its hurts and where we need help. the bureau doesn’t just disseminate data, we assist almost a quarter billion human beings to understand and improve themselves. the statistical profession and asa have an important role in helping to select from the views of orwell, demuth, keane, and others. as individuals and as an association, we have an obligation to make the orwellian view inappropriate by coupling our technical knowledge with our finest ethical behavior to produce a statistical system that all can respect. further, it is our responsibility to educate all segments of the society so that citizens can react to statistical output with intelligent questioning rather than uninformed cynicism. what can professional statisticians do to help make the choice between demuth’s system, which would make the federal government the nearly exclusive user of federal statistics, and keane’s desire to use the federal statistical system to make a better world for everyone? at the outset, it is important to realize that both demuth and keane are expressing extremist views that are not acceptable to the government or the public. so the task is to explore how these divergent views would compare in practice. one needs to consider the consequences of specific choices, such as whether to continue the subsidized government published statistical abstract, to continue without subsidy the government published statistical abstract, or to stop the publication by the government of the statistical abstract. another example: how much will industry pay for block level data from the census of population and housing? in short, we must study the consequences of movement toward these extremes. we would need more knowledge of the behavior of users of statistical products. going on with the statistical abstract example, why should the government publish it? it is a secondary publication that appears to have little to do with government decision making. is there much harm if the abstract is not published? is this glib description correct? can the abstract be prepared without intimate knowledge of the primary data source? do decision makers in the government make day to day use of the statistical abstract? i am not being systematic. i am just trying to indicate the pieces that need consideration to move in the demuth direction. similar considerations should be made regarding the move toward keane’s position, such as reducing the price of published data by 80%, giving contributors to public data a data product such as the statistical abstract, allowing research workers much better access to data files while preserving confidentiality, providing more government support for analysis of public data, and reviewing new and continuing data series to en courage products of use to many sectors. a basic requirement in all of this work is the ability to conduct some form of cost benefit analysis of public data, the subject of the next section. 3. cost benefit analysis the obvious way to justify decisions about starting or continuing an activity, including statistical projects, is to perform a cost benefit analysis. to date, very few statistical projects have received an economic analysis, and the united states statistical agencies have not been supportive of this work. a few studies have been made in the academic community, with limited success. at least two major reasons why this area of applied research has not flourished are the extreme complexity of the problems and our inability to formulate appropriate loss functions. consequently an appropriate strategy has been to bring cost benefit ideas to the decision making process and proceed with extreme caution to avoid unjustified formal structures (see national research council 1976, pp. 1 2, 7). per haps a more formal analysis is now acceptable: “the ultimate test must be the utility of a program to the government and private sectors weighed against its cost” (demuth 1983, p. 194). of course “ultimate” might refer to the distant future, “utility” might not be quantified, and “weighed” could mean roughly compared; and note that demuth now treats the government and private sectors in a symmetric manner. i was surprised recently to find a full blown example of cost benefit analysis applied to line of business (lb) data that had been collected by the federal trade commission (ftc; 1982). as far as i know, this is the only government conducted cost benefit analysis of data in the united states. the follow ing narrative comes from publicly available reports by the ftc on the cost benefit studies of the lb data program. the. com mission also published several volumes in the annual line of business report series; the 1974 and 1975 data were published in the fall of 1981 (see ftc 1981). only the data for 1973 1977 were collected. the lb story has fascinated me, and i hope you find it enlightening. by 1970 the ftc concluded that recent diversification trends had resulted in many large companies with financial reports that did not indicate the economics of markets associated with specific lines of business. consequently it was becoming more difficult to identify monopolistic behavior. so quickly, as these things go, the commission began collecting lb data for 1973. the sampled companies were not pleased to supply the data, and they made many legal efforts to avoid data preparation. some of the complaints were as follows: companies in the sample, the total assets, the total profits, and so forth, related to the line of business of the companies in the 1. it was too costly to prepare the data, since the normal accounting records were not adequate. the data cost per company should have been in the range of $10,000 100,000. some claimed it would cost in excess of $1,000,000, which was caused in part by a poor reading of the request for the data or because the 1973 request was too stringent. 2. it was obvious that the data were of no use. 3. it was obvious that the data were too revealing. as the procedures for collecting the data were improved and the litigation was resolved, the data for 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977 were collected. the sample included about 430 manufacturing companies that had either very large assets or a large share of the market in a particular line of business. the selected companies produced about half of the manufactured goods in the country. the lines of business being considered were about 270 sets of four digit codes from the standard industrial code. in selecting the companies, the objective was to have at least four companies submit data for every used line of business. this “rule of four” was to protect the confidentiality of the data; the sampled companies are publicly identified. the 1973 data were published in march 1979; these were particularly weak data because of limited compliance and difficulties in completing the form. nevertheless, the general accounting office in april 1979, when authorizing the col lection of 1977 data, asked the commission to prepare a plan for conducting a cost benefit analysis of the lb program. (apparently april 1979 corresponded to the end of the liti gation.) the commission had been triumphant and the general accounting office felt that the commission now had the re sources to defend lb against its critics. when the reagan administration came in, there were a variety of reasons 4om ments of the transition team and a presidential decree requiring a cost benefit analysis of regulations for the commission to prepare the analysis rather than just plan it. various drafts were prepared by the lb staff, outside referees were used, other commission staff prepared a criticism of the lb analysis, pub lic hearings were held, and in april 1984, lb was put out of business with a clean up of current research projects. the record is detailed but not clear. i am not sure about the quality of the decision, for too much of the evidence was presented by advocates rather than scientists. certain aspects of the story have a statistical side that i would like to record so that we will be prepared to protect ourselves from history repeating itself. 1. the lb program apparently had little, if any, professional statistical help. i think that a statistician could have been useful at every step. the technical know how of the statistical agencies would have improved the sampling procedures, developed the questionnaire, and provided a better format for presentation. the 1973 data collection was more like a field testing of the methodology than an actual survey. for what it accomplished, it was costly and aggravating. 3. the published data are not amenable to statistical analysis. for each line of business, we are given the number of 2. sample. but within lines there are no standard deviations or ranges. of course, a standard deviation would not have too much meaning in view of the method of data selection. collected data are often surrogates for quantities of direct interest. lb was based on accounting data; it was prepared and checked by accountants. economic variables were not ob served, but economic behavior was the subject of interest. (the accounting cost is usually the original cost and the economic cost is the replacement cost. in periods of inflation, the ac counting profits will appear inflated.) the lb data had a limited number of uses, such as searching for monopolistic behavior, looking for investment opportunities, and economic research. thus lb was a very good choice for an experimental effort with cost benefit analysis of national data. the crucial anticipated use of the line of business data was in the search for markets that exhibited monopolistic behavior. how this was to be accomplished was not spelled out. the participants in the cost benefit study acted as if the lb analysis was purely an economic analysis. too much effort went into formal answers rather than finding good strategies based on available data. the cost benefit analysis was done with little possible experience with the lb data. the planning of the cost benefit analysis began before any data were published. in 1979 it is doubtful that the data had been used for investigative purposes. even when the cost benefit analysis was published, little use of the data could have been made. thus in large part the analysis was of anticipated behavior and not of how the data were actually used. the analysis that was done could have been performed in 1972 to see if the project was promising; the major improvement in data between 1972 and 1982 was better estimates of the cost of data collection. the method of doing the cost benefit analysis involved three basic steps: (a) describe the sources of costs and benefits; (b) for each source give a theoretical model of the potential costs and benefits; (c) estimate for each source the potential cost and benefits associated with the lb program. in the staff analysis, the costs are ascribed to two sources: the government’s effort to collect and process the data and the companies’ effort to supply the data. the benefits are associated with various law enforcement programs, help to investors in search of profitable activities, and economic re search. this list was almost accepted by the critical reviewers. the critics brought forward an additional cost (negative benefit): the data would attract additional companies into lines of business that were particularly profitable. consequently there would be reduced motivation to invest in research and development, and thus business would become less productive. (the argument remains vague even when given in detail.) 9b. modeling the benefits requires economic theory. we shall consider the monopoly problem by a discussion of figure when the price is p,, area i + i1 + 111 represents consumers' profits, since it represents money these consumers would have been willing to spend to purchase the amount d'. when the price is p,,,, area i + i1 is profit; i is consumers' profit and i1 is the profit to the monopoly. the quantity i11 is the loss because of the monopoly. this is a classical view of the social harm of a monopoly. the hope was to help eliminate the loss i11 by proper use of the lb data. an alternative theory is that some or all of i1 is not profit to the monopoly, and thus some or all of 11 is a loss. the argument is that unusual and unproductive efforts are required by the monopoly to maintain the high price, p,,, > p,. since i1 b 111, the amount of loss with this model can be much larger than with the original model, and the results are very sensitive to the proportion of i1 considered to be loss. as noted, by 1979 there were already moderately good data on the cost of data collection. on the other hand, there appears to be very little data to estimate 11 and iii for most lines of business. further, the data and evidence to measure the proportion of i1 that is loss have not received much thought. so the amount of benefit that is potentially available by re moving the monopoly has much uncertainty. another area without data is how much more effective the government will be in eliminating monopolies with line of business data than without it. the staff analysis assumed that the line of business data would help in ordering markets in terms of the expected social loss that would be removed by selecting that market for investigation. in particular the data would arrange the five largest expectations in correct order all of the time, and without the data only the four largest expectations would be arranged correctly. evidence to support this conclusion was not given. table 1 summarizes the cost benefit analyses of the lb program. two sets of figures are given: the numbers from the 9c. ou8nllly figure 1. schematic price demand curve. staff analysis and from a critical review of the staff report. the bottom line is that the staff shows benefits exceeding costs by $591.7 million per year and the critics show costs exceeding benefits by $123.7 million per year. the tables from which table 1 was taken are subject to many conditions and assumptions, so the two sets of numbers might not correspond exactly to cases considered by the staff or critics. nevertheless, the tables give the correct impression of major disagreements on all items and totals with the exception of direct costs. (in some of the analyses there has been a partial reconciliation of the results, but large discrepancies remain.) it is clear that a major problem has occurred in this effort to make a detailed cost benefit analysis of a statistical program. the causes for this problem might include the following: variability in the analyses is caused by excessive un certainty about underlying parameters, lack of consensus on what the appropriate model is, and lack of knowledge of how data are used. the analyses were done in a real world by real people who acted as advocates of fixed positions rather than as idealized impartial scientists. this experience reinforces my belief that statisticians must be very cautious about attempting formal cost benefit analysis. at the same time, we must develop methods for understanding how data are used so that further steps can be taken toward correctly appraising their costs and benefits. 1. 2. 4. human rights the scientific statistical analysis of human rights appears at first unnecessary and harmful. one murder for political ends is too many; one starved child because of political greed is too much. nevertheless, there is an emerging field of human rights statistics. and a bit of thought can justify the need for the statistics. the extent of slavery in 19th century united states is instrumental to understanding the origins of the civil war and the task of reconstruction. all aspects of slavery, including demographic and economic statistics, are required. to understand current history, we must know about the holocaust and the refugee population. the quantitative features, as well as much else, are needed to understand and help eliminate the causes and results of human rights deprivations. the united states foreign assistance act of 1961 requires the department of state to prepare an annual report to congress on the “status” of human rights in countries to which we give assistance or that are members of the united nations. public law 97 113 (1981) is specifically concerned with human rights in el salvador. presumably congress should be more inclined to assist those countries that have or are attempting to have universal enjoyment of human rights than those countries in which the political leadership has a policy of systematically depriving segments of the population of their human rights. i have looked at the annual reports covering the period 1979 1983; they are massive volumes (about 1,500 pages) and tell of many horrors. two statistical issues that appear in these volumes are the downplaying of human rights to food, health, employment, and education and the measurement of killing. in the volumes for 1979 and 1980, the material on food, and so forth, appears between the sections on violation of the individual and the loss of civil and political freedom. this broad view of human rights is consistent with widely accepted standards. an adequate analysis of human rights should ac count for all of the major components (see dominguez 1979). starting with the 1981 data, the information on food, health, education, and employment is presented as an afterthought and is not clearly identified as a part of the report on the status of human rights. it should not be forgotten that the statistical description of human rights is already well established in the areas of food, health, education, and employment. the statistical techniques, experiences, and personnel from these areas could be used to help quantify our knowledge of all human rights. how many of the victims in insurgent territory are reported to the san salvador press. further, there are major questions concerning precisely who is a victim. in particular, there is lack of agreement between the department and other interested parties regarding whether deaths of civilians and insurgents as a result of government military action should be counted as political killings. these issues are addressed in a systematic study by eisen and verstappen (1984). el salvador is not unique in having statistical problems associated with killings; for example, see the front page story about uganda in the new york times on august 20, 1984. it is important to have a quantitative, policy neutral summary of the status of human rights. to obtain this information will tax the resources of statisticians and social scientists. the world fertility survey (wfs) overcame many of the difficulties that would occur in a world human rights survey (whrs). the difficulties of the wfs would be exaggerated in a whrs: it would be much more difficult to establish rapport with the countries being surveyed. the survey would require repeated cross sectional samples because of the relatively fast dynamics of human rights conditions at the national level. appropriate sampling methods for victimization are relatively undeveloped. such a survey is not impossible when one realizes that large parts of it are already being done in food, health, education, and employment areas by the united nations and other inter national groups. and if such a survey became an effective policy tool to increase human rights, the effort would be re warded. 5. defense this above all: to thine own self be true and it must follow, as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man. shakespeare, h d e r (act 1 , scene 3) a road to quantification of human rights selected by the department of state (1983, p. 2) is the number of political significant reduction in the number of killings in el salvador averages were 445 and 219 (see dept. of state 19833 p‘ 493; 1982, p425). 1 presume attention focused on killings because these events are so dramatic and their enumeration appears to be easy. an examination of the index and pages 194 197 of revolution in united states government statistics (duncan and shelton the united states, defense effort for world war ii. my impression and used for defense in the 1940s. the last 30 years of statistics in defense is in large part a mystery; defense is a closed activity that should not give current details to the general public. vietnam should leave a scar on the statistical profession. in a the department asserts that there was a 1978) shows that statisticians were involved in every phase of between 1981 and 1982; the department’s estimated sion is that the best of our statistical resources were developed a is a dramatic of loss of human rights, but it does not rep resent changes in implementation of policy’ a reduction in the the news gave ample suggestion that statistics was being used for self deception, but as far as 1 know, the profession made no effort to stop this malpractice. the following quotation gives that changes in the number of number of killings could result from the elimination of potential victims. they might be eliminated by emigration, by going underground, or by attrition. numbers of killings do not have further evidence of the existence of malpractice and the difficulties in trying to stop fooling oneself. a well established relationship to policy, and thus they should only be if the number of killings is to be measured, can it be done but he [mcnamaral subsequently stressed and re stressed his growing dis enchantment with the military reporting from viemam. “because,” he said, “you couldn’t reconcile the number of the enemy, the level of infiltration, the body count and the resultant figures. it just didn’t add up. i never did get the with caution as a in assessing policy. in a satisfactory way? in el salvador the basic method for answer, because there were’t any answers.” protested he could never get “a balanced equation.” (mohr 1984) finding the number of killings is to count the cases in the san ers have variations on this technique, such as occasionally interviewing witnesses or making site visits. it is hard to assess how accurate the pawrs want to how many victims are not v. findings 1. navy tactical aircraft mission capability rates are significantly lower than reported. as a result, actual readiness levels are lower than what is being found and consequently cannot be reported to the press, and portrayed to the congress. (committee on government operations 1984) the committee’s recommendations to the navy are sound; they could be paraphrased by saying, “get good statistical a few other current statistical activities in the united states defense are known, such as department of defense budget items of $3 million for commercial shipping statistics and $5 million for manpower data (office of management and budget 1984, p. 8), civilian research programs in probability and statistics, quality control acceptance sampling of military hard ware, and so forth. it is the “and so forth” that most interests me. i do not want to know military secrets, but i would like to be sure the military has available the best possible statistical support. i have no evidence that the nuclear forces in any area strategy, defense, civil defense have adequate statistical strength. the jobs our students take, the consulting work of my colleagues, and public reports give the impression that there is a statistical vacuum at the center of our concern. the military might have a secret, large, top quality statistical program, but if that is false what is the harm? a major fear of the nuclear age is the possibility of nuclear accidents, including nuclear wars. every approach to the prevention of these accidents has important statistical components. a continuing problem is the combination of bits of dependent data to obtain overall assessments. it is an unsolved hard soft problem. substantial statistical mission related research in this area should reduce the expected losses from accidents. there is much that we can infer about nuclear strategy (see bracken 1983). but the consequences of specific strategies have gigantic realms of uncertainty (e.g., concerning the likelihood of nuclear winter, see report in new york times on aug 5, 1984, p 1). it is hard to believe that these uncertainties are acting as preventives of the use of nuclear force. i am convinced that as long as we have nuclear arms, we will be better off if the amount of variability associated with considered strategies is carefully estimated. precise results might not be obtainable, hence statisticians should be playing a central role in assessing nuclear strategies. the first lesson the statistician has to offer the strategist is the concept of uncertainty and the measurement of variability. getting these ideas into the strategic discussion will take skill and hard work but they will add much realism. civil defense and consequences of nuclear accidents and wars have received much press coverage but, i suspect, not much public understanding. statisticians can contribute both to learning the consequences and to developing public under standing of nuclear accidents and wars. unless the consequences are developed and reported with integrity and the electorate understands the results, democracy cannot function in this age. yes, i think statisticians have a major role in nuclear defense! keeping in mind the problems of secrecy, how can we be sure the military is making adequate use of statisticians? the following are some possibilities. support. ” 1. keep the classification of material to a minimum, which is a policy asa supports through its affiliation with the american association for the advancement of science. encourage program committees to work with the nu2. clear regulatory agency and the department of defense to participate in relevant sessions. ask these agencies to suggest topics of interest. statisticians acting through the national research council or asa should work with the responsible agencies to develop external advisory committees on nuclear affairs. these committees could give expert advice on personnel and technical matters. and the existence of active advisory committees would increase the credibility of the quality of work in the nuclear area. 4. consistent with security requirements, a greater number of academic statisticians should become involved in nuclear mission oriented research. further, industrial and governmental projects should include senior statisticians. asa should sponsor development and dissemination of educational materials that clarify and quantify the uncertainties of nuclear defense. in the statistical area, i am concerned that the nuclear agencies do not have the best resources. speed (1984) expressed this reservation after analyzing reliability studies of nuclear power projects, and marshall (1984) reported the same reservation confounded with commercial secrets. 3. 5 6. political involvement asa and most statisticians have attempted to avoid partisan politics or the advocate role. nevertheless professional involvement in political issues such as what style of government we should have, how the government should make budget choices, how we should maintain and promote liberty, and how we can obtain peace should be emphasized. in these partisan areas, there are opportunities for the statistician to work impartially to allow the decision making process to be more enlightened. this last statement is sometimes doubted by those who think: if one studies a subject, say limited nuclear war, then one is an advocate of the subject; and the study and discussion of a subject make the subject acceptable. adversion of self deception and consideration of all options are necessary for enlightenment in partisan decision making. gibbons (1984) reported on the office of technology assessment, which is an attempt by the united states congress to clarify issues so that partisan politics can make better decisions; and in the preceding sections, i have made suggestions of how statisticians, asa, and affiliated societies can help the decision process in partisan affairs.",320,17.34375,4.97315315315315,0.262522522522523,5550,1457,15.8556120495496,10.8556120495496,36,8.54853156669639,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1985.10477118"

preparing this presidential address, i reviewed some of the addresses given by recent predecessors. i came to a profound conclusion. presidents of the statistical association (asa) are worriers. this could be for several reasons. members of asa may have a propensity to elect worriers. alternatively, the office of president may make the occupant a worrier, particularly the requirement of giving a presidential address that presumably should contain new wisdom and insights. and of course, there could be some major problems facing the statistics profession that deserve the continuing concern of the presidents. george box (1979) worried about, among other things, data analysts’ neglecting other equally important jobs of statisticians, such as designing investigations and building models. ho hartley (1980) worried about the proper balance between mathematical and applied statistics and the relations between statisticians and subject matter specialists. margaret martin (1981) worried about how to improve the production of statistical data for public use. ralph bradley (1982) was concerned about the future of statistics as a discipline. dick anderson (1984) worried about where the statistics profession should be going, and richard savage was concerned about difficult measurement problems in the social sciences that are being neglected. i too am a worrier. i shall speak this evening about two of my worries. the first concerns the possibility of statisticians’ excluding themselves from important statistical problems in other disciplines. the second worry pertains to difficulties that are encountered when statisticians work jointly with specialists in other disciplines on problems with significant statistical aspects. i am not, of course, the first person to have these worries. in fact, some of the earlier presidential addresses have dealt with these concerns. still, they are important worries that de serve repeated discussion. 1 will discuss the two areas of concern in a context that many of you may not be familiar with namely, the uses of statistical sampling techniques in account ing and auditing. this is an area of application in which relatively few statisticians have worked, and i shall give a brief historical review to provide some perspective. the theme of this annual meeting, statistics and public pol icy, is closely related to my concerns. at a number of sessions at this meeting, we have heard about important issues of public policy to which statistics can make significant contributions if we are willing to enlarge our domain of interest. an example is the very complex problem of quantitatively measuring political repression. enlarging our domain of interest is not enough, however, for statisticians to play an effective role in the area of public policy. we statisticians must also learn how to interact better with specialists from other disciplines with whom we are working on a given problem, as well as with the decision makers. otherwise we may have difficulty in gaining acceptance of our technical expertise in the problem formulation and analysis stages and, most important, may not gain acceptance of the results of the analysis leading to implementation. gaining acceptance of a statistician’s technical expertise and of the study’s results for implementation requires interpersonal skills that have often been neglected in the training of statisticians. in enlarging the domain of our interest and improving our interpersonal skills to enable statisticians to work more effectively with others and gain acceptance of the study results, we are assisted by a growing recognition of the importance and usefulness of statistical methodology. science 84 undertook recently, as part of celebrating its fifth anniversary, to identify 20 of the most important discoveries in science, technology, and medicine of the 20th century. the ground rules required that “the discovery had to have been made in the 20th century , and it must have had a significant impact on the way we live or the way we think about ourselves and our world” (hammond 1984). among the 20 discoveries identified by science 84 are einstein’s theory of relativity, the discovery of plastics, the discovery of the structure of dna, and karl pearson’s development of the chi squared goodness of fit test. this statistical test was selected to represent the contributions that statistics has made, in the words of ian hacking (1984), “by changing the ways we reason, experiment, and form our opinions about (the world)” (p. 70). 2. statistical applications in accounting the development of statistical inroads into the fields of ac counting and auditing is instructive about difficulties in gaining acceptance of statistical ideas, about problems in trying to adapt standard statistical methodology to special situations, and about efforts by nonstatisticians to develop needed new statistical methods. i shall first describe briefly two areas of accounting in which statistical sampling methodology has been applied and then turn to the area of auditing. adoption of statistical sampling methods was relatively easy in connection with studies made by railroads for use in proceedings concerning the merger of railroads before the interstate commerce commission. i first became involved in some of these studies in the 1960s, when railroads were closely regulated and sought conditions from the interstate commerce commission to protect them from serious negative consequences of mergers by other railroads. the methodology that had been commonly employed was to choose a segment of traffic, such as all shipments during a two week period, and examine all of the shipments in this segment to see how much of the traffic would have been diverted by the proposed merger. judgments on the potential diversion of traffic were made by traffic experts. the representativeness of the segment of traffic selected from all of the traffic during the study period, frequently the calendar year, also needed to be defended by the traffic experts. it was natural for statisticians to propose that a probability sample of the traffic for the study period be selected instead of a judgment sample. in this way, one could obtain with known precision an estimate of the amount of traffic diversion that would be found by expert judgment if the traffic experts could examine all traffic in the frame with the same care as that used in the sample study. the design of the sample survey on which i worked used standard survey sampling methods, since no special problems arose in this application. when this statistical study was completed and hearings on it were held before the interstate commerce commission, the lawyers on the other side questioned me at great length about statistical concepts in general and the statistical design and evaluation of this particular study. as the use of statistical sampling in these traffic studies became more frequent, the cross examination of the statistical expert became much less intense, and the burden of defense began to shift to those who still used judgment sampling. in 1971, the bureau of economics of the interstate commerce commission issued a staff report containing guidelines for the presentation of the results of sample studies based on probability sampling (bureau of economics 1971). the use of judgment sampling was not even considered in these guidelines. thus the adoption of statistical sampling methods occurred relatively easily in this area of application. another use of sampling methodology in accounting that received relatively easy acceptance is found in studies of the liability that companies selling trading stamps incur for sold stamps that will be redeemed. when a trading stamp company sells stamps to a retailer (e.g., a supermarket chain), it incurs a liability for redeeming the stamps that will be turned in by consumers. the amount of this liability affects both the balance sheet and the income statement of the trading stamp company. a difficulty in ascertaining the liability arises because not all of the trading stamps will eventually be turned in. some stamps will be lost; others will be forgotten. further, some trading stamps may not be redeemed for long periods of time. the methods for estimating the liability that were used in the 1960s, when i first encountered this problem, tended to be nonstatistical. working with two accountants, we developed a probabilistic model that utilizes information on the age of trading stamps at the time of redemption to estimate the liability for redeemed stamps. information about the length of time stamps are outstanding can be obtained from stamps that are redeemed because the identification number of the stamp can be used to determine the time of issue. since billions of stamps may be redeemed each year, it is clearly not possible to study the age of each stamp redeemed. the use of interpenetrating samples permitted an evaluation of the sampling error in the estimate of the liability that would have been obtained with the model if all trading stamps during the study period had been examined. by 1972 the internal revenue service issued guidelines on acceptable methods of estimating the liability for trading stamps to be eventually redeemed (internal revenue service 1972). one of the acceptable methods is based on probability sampling, with the minimum sample size specified. other methods are also permitted by the guidelines, but probability sampling results were quickly accepted. 3. statistical sampling in auditing the acceptance of statistical sampling was much more difficult to achieve in auditing than in the two areas of accounting just discussed. auditing is a specialized area within accounting. internal auditors are concerned with reviewing the operations of an organization to see whether the system of internal control is operating effectively. a system of internal control consists of a variety of managerial policies, such as a requirement that checks over a certain amount be signed by two persons. external, independent auditors (certified public accountants) are engaged by boards of directors of corporations and other organizations to review the financial statements prepared by the organization to determine whether the statements fairly present the financial position, results of operations, and changes in financial position in conformity with generally accepted ac counting principles. to make these reviews, independent and internal auditors use a variety of audit procedures, many of which frequently employ samples. samples of transactions, such as payments of bills received, are used to make inferences about the effectiveness of the operation of the system of internal control. this type of sampling generally is concerned with qualitative characteristics or attributes, such as whether an internal control operated improperly for a transaction. the parameter of interest is usually the process proportion of transactions for which the internal control operates improperly. sampling of accounts, such as accounts receivable and inventory, is a second type of sampling used in auditing. sampling of account balances is usually concerned with quantitative characteristics. the auditor ascertains, after examining a line item such as an individual inventory item or an individual ac count receivable, the correct balance for this item. this correct balance is often the quantitative characteristic of interest; it is frequently called the audit amount, in contrast to the amount recorded by the company, called the book amount. of course, if the book amount is correct, the audit amount equals the book amount. alternatively, the characteristic of interest may be the error amount (book amount minus the audit amount) in a line item. the objective of sampling account balances for independent auditors is to make an inference about the accuracy of the book balance, that is, whether the total book amount is reasonably close to the total audit amount that would have been determined if all line items in the population had been audited with the same care as had been employed in the study of the sample of line items. alternatively, the objective may be viewed as making an inference regarding whether the total error amount is reasonably small. the earliest suggestions for auditors to use statistical sampling came in the 1930s. other papers on this subject followed in the 1940s, including a monograph by vance (1950) in which he suggested the use of wald's sequential sampling methods for audits. at about the same time, i was a graduate student at columbia university and met william d. cranstoun, a partner in an auditing firm, who suggested that i explore the use of statistical sampling in auditing. the result was a paper in the journal of accountancy, in which i explained the advantages of using statistical sampling methods. these early papers tended to focus on sampling applications in which the characteristics of interest are attributes, primarily sampling of transactions. gradually attention shifted to statistical sampling of accounts. i shall focus attention on this area because the sampling of transactions for purposes of making inferences about an attribute presented relatively few difficulties. in contrast, serious problems were encountered in applying statistical sampling methods to sampling account balances. consider the estimation of the population total audit amount. we shall denote the audit amount for the ith line item in the population by x i and the total audit amount by x: n x = 2 xi, i = i where n is the number of line items in the population. if a simple random sample of n line items is selected and the audit amount for each item in the sample is established, an unbiased estimator of x is obtained by expanding the sample total audit amount by the reciprocal of the sampling fraction: here xi denotes the audit amount of the ith sample item and x denotes the sample mean audit amount per line item. estimator (2) is called a mean per unit estimator in the accounting literature. a difficulty with this estimator is that it tends to be very imprecise because of the large variability in many accounting populations. even though stratification by book amount makes this estimator much more precise, it still suffers from several limitations. comparison of the estimated total audit amount with the total book amount may indicate the presence of a substantial total error amount even though no errors were found in the sample. in addition, the use of large sample confidence limits, such as the one sided lower limit for the population total audit amount, may not be appropriate for sample sizes commonly used in auditing. since the auditor knows the book amounts of the line items, this information can be incorporated into the estimation procedure. let yi denote the book amount for the ith line item and y the population total book amount. further, the population total error amount shall be denoted by e, which is defined as follows: one possible estimator that incorporates the supplementary in formation about book amounts is the difference estimator. this estimator for simple random sampling of line items when the population total error amount is to be estimated is where (6) is the difference between the book and audit amounts for the ith sample item and 2 is the sample mean difference per line item. another possibility is the ratio estimator: where j is the sample mean book amount per line item. these estimators can also be used with stratified random sampling, though the gains in precision are not large when accounting populations with smallor moderate sized errors are sampled. still another way in which the supplementary information about book amounts can be used is by means of sampling with probability proportionate to book amount. an unbiased estimator of the population total error amount with probability proportional to size (pps) sampling is estimators such as the difference, ratio, and regression estimators with simple or stratified random sampling and the unbiased estimator with pps sampling have several important limitations. when, as frequently occurs in auditing, the sample contains no errors, that is, when di 0, the estimated standard error for these estimators is zero, as may be seen from the estimated variance formula for the difference estimator: n n t (a. d)2 (9) an estimated standard error of zero suggests perfect precision, a conclusion that is not warranted. in addition, the large sample confidence limits frequently are not appropriate for sample sizes used in auditing, even when errors tend to be present in the sample. table 1 demonstrates the frequent inapplicability of upper confidence bounds for the population total error amount calculated on the basis of large sample theory for sample size 100, a sample size that often would be considered large in auditing. coverage results (i.e., the proportion of times the upper bound equals or exceeds the population total error amount) are presented in this table for a simulation study in which 600 replications of samples of size 100 were selected. the estimators considered are the stratified mean per unit estimator (table la), the stratified ratio estimator (table lb), and the pps unbiased estimator (table lc). the study populations are actual accounting populations into which errors were seeded with different error rates, based on empirical information about error amounts observed in audits. (not all error rates were studied for each accounting population for the pps unbiased estimator.) the upper bounds were calculated for a nominal 93.3% confidence level by means of large sample normal distribution theory. it is clear from table 1 b and c that the stratified ratio and pps unbiased estimators frequently have coverages far below the nominal 93.3% level and from table la that the stratified mean per unit estimator also at times has coverages below the nominal level. a search for bounds not based on large sample theory began in the 1960s. a bound was developed by stringer (1963), the original logic for which involved stratification of the line items by book amount and sampling each stratum in proportion to the amount of dollars contained in the stratum. anderson and teitlebaum (1973) recognized that the logic of the stringer bound could be simplified by considering a sample selection scheme that involves a random selection of dollar units and then prorating any errors found to the individual dollars in the line item containing the error. this method of sampling is frequently called dollar unit sampling or monetary unit sampling in accounting circles. when monetary units are selected at random and with replacement and any errors found are promted to the individual monetary units, the process can be viewed equivalently as sampling with probability proportional to book amount with replacement. the stringer bound is applicable when the errors in line items in accounting populations are overstatements. it can also be used for understatement errors when the auditor is able to spec ify a bound on the extent of understatements. an example of an overstatement error is when the book value of a particular inventory item on hand is $1,000, whereas the audit discloses that only one half of the items are on hand and that the correct value is $500. the amount of overstatement error as a proportion of the book amount is called a taint. a taint thus is the prorated error amount assigned to each monetary unit. since overstatement taints generally cannot exceed 1 o, the range for overstatement taints is usually taken to be fromto 1.0. a conservative estimate of the total overstatement error can there fore be obtained by treating each observed taint as if it were 1.0. but then the problem is simply one of obtaining an upper bound for a population proportion (the proportion of monetary units in the population that contain an error) and multiplying this bound by the total number of monetary units in the population to obtain an upper bound for the population total over statement error amount. the stringer bound begins with this conservative upper bound and heuristically reduces it to take account of the fact that the observed taints may not all be at the maximum value of 1.0. though no proof exists as yet that the stringer bound is a confidence bound, simulation studies show that the coverages associated with the stringer bound always exceed the nominal confidence level and often are very close to 100%. still, the stringer bound has a serious weakness. its high coverage is associated with bound values that often far exceed the population total error amount. this lack of tightness of the stringer bound leads to substantial risks of incorrect conclusions when it is used for testing purposes. monetary unit sampling may be viewed as sampling of a mixture of populations. the mixture consists of a probability mass associated with no error and a continuous distribution associated with error taints. there may also be another prob ability mass, for taints t = 1 o, that is, for 100% overstatement errors. a similar type of mixture of populations has been noted by j. bradley (1982) in behavioral science applications. the reason a standard mixtures approach (e.g., aitchison 1955) is not applicable in auditing situations is that the probability mass for no error is often very large. hence frequently all items in the sample are correct, thus providing no information about error taints. monetary unit sampling may also be viewed in a discretized form as multinomial sampling. the multinomial classes rep resent the different possible prorated outcomes rounded to the desired degree. for example, if the error taints are rounded to the nearest cent, there would be 101 classes in the multinomial distribution, including the case of no error. fienberg, leitch, and i used this perspective to develop an upper bound for the population total overstatement error. a difficulty with this approach is the computational complexity of finding the joint confidence region and maximizing over it. another approach to overcoming the difficulties associated with samples that frequently do not provide any information about non zero error amounts is to use prior information by means of a bayesian formulation. felix and grimlund (1977) suggested a bayesian approach based on a random sample of line items that assumes a normal distribution of error amounts. cox and snell (1979) proposed a bayesian bound based on monetary unit sampling. their model assumes that the prior distribution for 11, the population error rate per monetary unit, is a gamma distribution, and that the prior distribution for ,la, the population mean taint for dollar units in error, is an inverse gamma distribution. they further assume that ii and p are in dependent, the observed number of errors in the sample is a poisson variable, and the observed error taints are observations from an exponential distribution. it then follows that the posterior distribution of the population total error amount is a simple multiple of the f distribution. hence a bayesian 1 a bound for the population total error amount can be easily constructed by obtaining an appropriate percentile of the f distribution and multiplying it by the multiple. investigated the behavior of the cox and snell bound in repeated sampling from a given population, in the same spirit as some of the frequency calculations suggested by rubin (1984). we found that conservative values for the prior parameters exist for which the cox and snell bound has coverages near or above the bayesian probability level for a wide range of different populations. although there had been relatively little research activity in the area of statistical sampling in auditing for many years, a large amount of research in this area is now being undertaken. recent developments include a proposal to construct an upper bound for the population total error amount by modeling the sampling distribution of the mean error as a three parameter gamma distribution and using the moments from the sample, together with a variety of heuristics, to obtain estimates of the parameters of the gamma distribution (dworin and grimlund 1984). another recent proposal is to combine the multinomial sampling model with the dirichlet prior distribution to obtain bayesian bounds for the population total overstatement error amount (tsui, matsumura, and tsui 1985). much of the current research on the use of statistical sampling methods in auditing (as well as on uses of other statistical methods, such as the use by auditors of regression methods for analytic review) is being conducted by accountants, not statisticians. accountants today are receiving better training in mathematics and statistics than a generation ago, and many are eager to use this training. this strand in the history of the development of statistical sampling methods for auditing, namely, the active participation of persons who would not be considered statisticians by many professional statisticians, is also found in other disciplines. a consequence of accountants carrying on much of the re search on statistical sampling methods for auditing is that many of the procedures developed are heuristic in nature, with relatively limited follow up of the theoretical considerations by statisticians. in addition to the accelerated research in statistical sampling methodology for auditing, there have also developed a much wider acceptance and increased usage of statistical sampling methods by auditors. in 1962 came the first official pronouncement from a committee of the institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) in a report stating that statistical sampling was permitted under generally accepted auditing standards (aicpa statistical sampling subcommittee 1983, p. 6). by 1981 aicpa’s auditing standards board issued statement on auditing standards no. 39, which provides explicitly for the use of statistical sampling in auditing, in addition to non statistical or judgmental sampling. a number of the large auditing firms now routinely use statistical sampling in many audit applications. collaborative efforts between statisticians and accountants have had mixed results. on an individual level, there have been some very fruitful outcomes in research and practice as a result of collaboration by individuals. in addition, aicpa engaged a statistician to prepare a monograph on statistical sampling in auditing in which both standard statistical sampling procedures and some procedures specially developed for sampling appli cations in auditing are presented (roberts 1978). at an institutional level, efforts at collaboration have been less successful. asa set up the committee on statistical sampling in auditing in 1960. the first chair of the committee was fred stephan, a former president of asa. this committee undertook a number of joint activities with the aicpa statistical sampling committee, including joint meetings of the two committees and joint sponsorship at asa annual meetings of sessions devoted to statistical sampling in auditing. indeed, the asa committee for several years had as chair an accountant active in both aicpa and asa. still, no formal collaborative efforts of the two groups resulted, despite the existence of serious problems in applying statistical sampling methods to auditing, for which expertise in both auditing and statistics is required. indeed, the asa committee on statistical sampling in auditing was recently abolished, largely because of the difficulties in developing joint collaborative efforts. stronger organized collaboration between statisticians and auditors might have affected auditors’ views about nonstatistical sampling. a recent guide to statistical and nonstatistical sampling in auditing (aicpa statistical sampling subcommittee 1983) includes in the section on nonstatistical sampling an illustrative table of sample sizes calculated on the basis of statistical sampling specifications. the guide notes that “neither statement on auditing standards no. 39 nor this guide requires the auditor to compare the sample size for a nonstatistical sampling application with a corresponding sample size calculated using statistical theory. ” still the guide continues that “at times, however, an auditor might find familiarity with sample sizes based on statistical theory helpful when applying professional judgment and experience in considering the effect of various planning considerations on (judgmental) sample size” the guide then proceeds to give an example of the use of this table for planning the sample size of a nonstatistical sample. a serious danger is that auditors might consider judg mental samples to be equivalent to statistical samples if they use the sample sizes indicated by the table. 4. some lessons for statisticians the intent of this historical recitation is not to place any blame for the failure of statisticians and accountants to collaborate more successfully. rather, i see in this experience some useful lessons for statisticians. there are many other disciplines besides accounting in which expanded uses of statistical methods would be highly desirable and in which special problems in applying statistical methodology are encountered that could lead to useful new methodological developments in statistics. we need to learn how to collaborate more effectively with experts in other subject matter areas. we also need to take greater interest in, and be more sympathetic to, the struggle of specialists in other disciplines to expand their use of statistical methods and to assist in the development of needed new statistical methods. if this greater collaboration with experts of other disciplines makes the boundaries of statistics less well defined, i would conclude that fuzzy boundaries of statistics are preferable to well defined ones that will isolate us from significant new statistical developments in other subject matter fields. two other examples of where, in my view, fuzzy boundaries of statistics are desirable are the evaluation and control of measurement errors in statistical data and the improvement of quality in manufacturing, service, and other processes. statistical data are subject to a large variety of measurement errors. some of these are associated with interviewers or other collectors of the data, others are related to respondents, and still others are connected with measurement instruments and the processing of the data. some statisticians view the evaluation and control of measurement errors as outside the boundaries of statistics, perhaps because they do not attach much importance to the collection of statistical data. this view, which divorces the analysis of data from their collection, is short sighted in my opinion, because the measurement errors in the data may be much more important than the sampling errors. under these circumstances, statisticians who fail to consider measurement errors and concentrate entirely on the analysis of sampling errors are grappling with side issues instead of the main problem. an illustration of the magnitudes of measurement errors that can be present in statistical data is found in a study that waksberg and i undertook some years ago. a new sample survey on residential alterations and re pairs expenditures was being developed, and data were to be obtained by personal interviews. there were a number of concerns about the data collection procedures, one of which was that recall of expenditures could involve telescoping that is, expenditures made. some months ago are recalled as having been made more recently and hence reported in an incorrect period. an experimental study was undertaken that included two methods of recall for purposes of studying possible tele scoping. the first type of recall was unbounded recall, the usual type of recall wherein respondents are asked for expenditures since a given date, without any control over possible telescoping. the second type of recall was bounded recall: the respond ent was told of expenditures reported in the previous interview and asked about additional expenditures made during the most recent period. by using the information about expenditures reported in the previous interview, it is possible with bounded recall to exclude the reporting of previously reported expenditures as expenditures for the most recent period. based on a comparison of unbounded one month recall with bounded one month recall for identical periods of time from panels constituting probability samples from the population un der study, it was found that the telescoping of large alterations and repairs expenditures amounted to more than. when measurement errors of this magnitude are present in statistical data, emphasis on refinements in the statistical analysis of the data, rather than on control and evaluation of measurement errors, is misplaced. to argue that the control and evaluation of measurement errors is the responsibility of subject matter specialists alone is to ignore the important contributions that statisticians can make and the vital interest that statisticians should have in the data to be analyzed. the improvement of quality is another example of the desirability of fuzzy boundaries for statistics. during world war i1 and shortly thereafter, great interest in statistical quality control developed, based on the ideas of shewhart and stimulated by a number of statisticians, including deming. in time, interest in statistical quality control waned. more recently, there has been a strong revival of interest in quality assurance and quality improvement as a result of competitive pressures. one of the differences between now and 40 years ago is the realization that statistical methods by themselves are not magic tools that provide instant solutions. as deming (1982), among others, has stressed, improvements in quality and productivity require a total effort, including management reorientation and changes in organizational operations. statistical methodology plays a key role, but not an isolated one. joiner (1985) noted that statisticians can play a key role because many of them are accustomed to thinking about processes rather than isolated events and are trained in gathering and analyzing data about processes to help improve them. but joiner also stressed the importance of interpersonal skills, team building skills, and knowledge of organizational behavior in achieving improvements in quality and productivity. well defined, narrow boundaries of statistics will tend to keep statisticians isolated and unappreciative of the team role that they must play to achieve lasting gains in quality and productivity improvements. this danger of viewing statistics too narrowly is not confined to the area of quality and productivity improvement. narrow boundaries of statistics also make it difficult for statisticians to participate effectively in fostering the utilization of current statistical methodologies and the development of needed new ones in other subject matter areas in which expanded uses of statistics could be very helpful. the problem of too narrow boundaries for statistics also has important implications for asa. too narrow and well defined boundaries for statistics will isolate our organization from significant developments and applications of statistical methodologies that are being carried on by persons on the boundaries of statistics and other disciplines. as one example, let me mention the area of simulation in management science. important and difficult statistical problems arise in the design and analysis of management science simulation studies, yet much of this research is carried out by persons who do not consider their primary affiliation to be with statistics and who tend to publish in management science journals. the trend for many major new statistical developments to occur at the interfaces of statistics and other disciplines such as computer graphics, decision support systems, expert systems, and artificial intelligence is very clear. in my view, this trend presents a number of major challenges to us as statisticians: 1 we need to undertake more extensive joint work with experts from other disciplines on problems with significant statistical elements. 2. we need to recognize the statistical activities of persons who are not primarily statisticians and to draw them into some of our activities and provide helpful services to them. 3. we need to improve our interpersonal skills to gain acceptance of the statistical point of view and implementation of conclusions based on appropriate statistical methodologies and analyses. recognition of the importance of interpersonal skills and attitudes by statisticians is not too widespread. boen and zahn’s (1982) monograph on statistical consulting makes a cogent case for the consideration of interpersonal aspects in effective statistical consulting. broadly viewed, statisticians do consulting whenever they work with other subject matter area specialists, whether in universities, industry, or government. indeed, the term “statistical consulting” may often carry the wrong con notation; a statistician serving as a “team member” may be a more appropriate term for many situations involving a joint effort. as deming said in connection with statisticians in industry, “statisticians and other technical people can reach maximal usefulness in industry, including service industries, only by adopting as their main purpose help to management” (deming 1985, p. 9). statisticians in industry and government probably are more aware of the need for interpersonal skills by statisticians than many academicians, which could explain why statistical consulting skills frequently are not emphasized in academic statistics programs. (an interesting description of a statistical consulting curriculum was recently given by mcculloch, boroto, meeter, polland, and zahn 1985.) 5. concluding comments having now developed for you my concerns about the possibility of statisticians excluding themselves from important statistical problems in other disciplines and about the difficulties that are encountered when statisticians work jointly with specialists from other disciplines, i would like to conclude with a personal hope and a personal note. my personal hope is that as the statistical association later this year charts broad directions for the future, it will recognize the growing trend of many new, important statistical developments occur ring at the interfaces of statistics and other disciplines, and that it will view this trend as a challenge to work cooperatively with other disciplines. further, it is my hope that the growing importance of statisticians’ working with specialists from other disciplines will be reflected in academic statistics programs in the years ahead. and now i would like to close on a personal note. preparing this presidential address has provided me with an opportunity to reflect on my career and my professional association with other statisticians and persons from other disciplines. i have found membership in asa a most rewarding experience. it has given me the opportunity to meet fine colleagues and to make friendships that have lasted many years. it has also enabled me to serve the profession in a variety of capacities. for all of this, i am most thankful. and i should add that i am also thankful for living in a country that has provided opportunities for a young immigrant refugee to develop and grow.

Marquardt","1970-1999"," mankind has been doing applied statistics for thousands of years. when faced with a problem almost any problem people can be observed deciding what data are needed and are practical to collect; then obtaining the data, analyzing the data, developing a conceptual frame work that is consistent with the data (a predictive model, if you will); and then choosing a course of action based at least in part upon the data. statistics has been a recognizable discipline for several centuries. that is, there has been some generalized theoretical basis and some form of documentation. in fact, the discipline of statistics is older than many of the other major disciplines we know today. statistics is now widely employed in all areas of society including industry and government. for example, in the 1986 president’s invited address given by richard e. heckert, chief executive of the du pont company, at the asa annual meetings, dr. heckert made it clear that the modern corporation is dependent upon the discipline of statistics in a wide variety of ways. the statistical data supplied by government agencies is but one example of the dependence of corporations, and the whole of society, upon statistical services. statistics and statisticians also have vital internal roles in production, research, market ing, and support functions of the modern corporation. the statistical association was founded in 1839. only the philosophical society, the fore runner umbrella organization for all scientific disciplines, is older among professional associations (wallis 1966). anyone who has followed the growth of the asa during the last several decades must be impressed with the breadth of its activities, which mirror the growth of statistics as a discipline, as the asa approaches its 150th anniversary, we can take great pride in the accomplishments of our discipline and our association. nevertheless, there are some basic problems with the discipline of statistics and with statisticians. i will explore some of those problems in this address. i have selected the title “the importance of statisticians.” one of the problems is the lack of visibility of statistics as a discipline. during my tenure as president elect and president, i have recommended widespread study of paul minton’s (1983) article, which describes the scope of the visibility problem. just one statistic from that article: of the approximately 2,000 four year colleges in the united states and canada, only about one tenth offer degree pro grams in statistics, and only half of these include the name “statistics” in the department title. in my own observation, the problem of visibility is accompanied by another symptom, a perceived lack of influence. just one example: most disciplines today have commercial magazines that are circulated free of charge to professionals in the field who are judged to influence purchase decisions for goods and ser vices related to the field. statistics has no such magazine to my knowledge. doesn’t this suggest that the external perception is that statisticians have little influence? i know that many will be quick to respond that these problems are not unique to statisticians but are affecting many scientific and technical disciplines, especially the mathematical sciences. you may be familiar, for example, with the recent study reports in this area, notably the national academy of sciences report by the david committee. we do have to acknowledge that we are caught up in difficulties that are affecting all of the sciences, but we cannot accept those difficulties as an excuse for statisticians. in fact, we have special problems of our own making. i am convinced that we need to reexamine the role of the statistician. i think we will find that we statisticians have sold ourselves short. let’s begin by examining how others see us. one penetrating insight is what may be called the cock tail party perspective: upon learning that another member of a conversation group is a statistician, the comment is “a statistician? how very essential. one is, after all, a statistic all of one’s life, isn’t one?” this narrow view of statisticians is widely held. we are seen as compilers of data. every sports announcer must have a statistician for support. social and governmental agencies are seen as simple compilers of data on all manner of subjects. people may view this as a highly important function, but not necessarily as a difficult or challenging role in society. we know this view is very narrow. we know that even within this narrow view there are deep and complex issues on how to design and collect the samples, how to process the large quantities of data, how to make re liable predictions, and so forth. we know that the statistical choices can influence resulting policy choices by government and business organizations, but the public at large seems to be unaware of this influence of statistical choices. taking the next step, there are many who see us from what i will call the middle view. they see statisticians as specialists or consultants for defined problems. they know thatwe can provide designs for surveys and experiments we do data analyses and develop predictive modelswe can make quantitative, reliable inferences from many statisticians today would be very content if only the majority of their clients would operate from this middle view. how wonderful it would be! and yet i have characterized it as the “middle view.” you can infer that i must envision a wider view from which others can or should see us. the wider view is that statisticians are systems guides for tough, fuzzy issues wherever the collection and interpretation of data should be involved. the wider view expects statisticians to provide the following:full service guidance and participation in problem disservices for problems in any area of application services at any level of detail or abstraction. and solution from this perspective, individual statistical methods are viewed as tools or component elements in an overall systems approach. some statisticians and statistical service organizations today really do operate in this mode and are seen this way by their clients. i will come back to this perspective and expand upon it, but first let’s examine how we see ourselves. first, there is the narrow view. these people see statistics as a branch of theoretical or applied mathematics. statisticians with this view often operate as ifonly abstract problems are permitted within the disonly teaching and research are honorable careers. this is a vital part of statistics, but it is certainly not the whole. we must nurture and support a minority of statisticians engaged in these activities. indeed, we must be ever certain that many of our brightest and best are focusing their efforts on teaching and research. it is crucial to the long term health and survival of our discipline. but this narrow view cannot be the view of the majority of statisticians. if that ever happened, then statistics would lose all hope of visibility and influence, and soon the financial support from educational institutions and funding agencies would dry up as well. thus, the very livelihood of teachers and researchers is ultimately tied to the visibility and influence of applied statisticians. some statisticians can operate within the narrow view, but all statisticians should philosophically support a wider view. history seems to show that the most influential statisticians tend to have strong roots in both theory and application. most statisticians today. they see statistics as discipline let’s turn our attention to the consensus view, held bya unique discipline using mathematics and probability theory as a tool and the scientific method as a philosophyproviding a variety of satisfying careers in abstract theory or practical applications in industry, government, the service sector, or educational institutionsproving useful in any field of application. from this consensus view, statisticians (and statistical service organizations) can see the world around them in terms of various market segments. one way of dividing the world into market segments in which statistical services are needed is on the basis of subject matter fields such asphysical and engineering scienceslife and health sciencesbusiness and economicssocial sciences. another way of dividing the world into market segments for statistical services is to recognize that within each subject matter field there are generic functions such as marketing production research and development. statisticians can provide needed services in all of those market segments. with this as the consensus view of how statisticians see themselves, we are in a position to examine more critically where we are. let’s take a look at who our competitors are in the job market. there are many. they include engineers (industrial, electrical, mechanical, electronic, chemical, etc.) physicists business professionals, such as those with m.b.a. degrees operations researchers mathematicians social scientists computer specialists. why do i characterize these as “competitors” to statisticians in the job market? think about what many of these people do on the job. they do such things as deciding what data are needed for a specific problem and how to collect the data. they summarize the data in tabular and graphical form. they analyze the data. they develop predictive models from the data. they derive conclusions and recommend courses of action, all based largely on the data. what are they doing on the job? they are doing statistics for a large proportion of their time. many of these professionals hold jobs in which statistical functions are a primary work component. in fact, don’t we find in any industrial, government, or service organization that people often are assigned to jobs whose subject matter fields are different from the fields they studied in school? the bottom line is that the actual content of many jobs throughout society has more to do with statistics than with any other single subject matter field. yet the proportion of these jobs that are held by persons formally trained in statistics is negligible. why? it all comes back to our view of our role as statisticians. our standard marketing approach in the field of statistics has been to produce a small number of people trained at the graduate level. those who have strayed from the universities have positioned themselves as specialists available to the various markets around them. but i ask, why do we see our role as limited to providing help from outside the system? if statistical tools and functions are the primary components of many jobs, why can’t people trained in statistics hold some of those jobs? we should ask, what is different about the marketing approach in such fields as engineering or business com pared with statistics? the biggest single thing that is different is that these fields have created a large bachelor’s level base of people. what does that accomplish? the field becomes legitimized and visible as a career and as a category of people available to be hired into standard jobs (minton 1983). employers become aware of the field. the brightest and best from the bachelor’s program become available as candidates for graduate training. the field can grow in stature and importance in society because there can be enough statisticians to achieve visibility and influence as a discipline. as things stand today it is almost impossible to become a formally trained statistician without having made a de liberate revision of career path after having first attained a bachelor’s degree in some other field. i suspect that most of us came to statistics from some other field, perhaps one of the fields mentioned in section 5. for many of us, statistics has now become our primary field. for others, statistics may be a secondary field. this current marketing approach is rooted in the organizational culture of the field of statistics. it is instructive to consider what “organizational culture” is. schein (1985) defined culture as a “pattern of basic assumptions in vented, discovered, or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems” (p. 9). he noted that “because such assumptions have worked repeatedly, they are likely to be taken for granted and to have dropped out of aware ness” (p. 9). the cultural perceptions that surround the narrow view of statistical teaching and research (sec. 4), the concept that applied statisticians must always be trained or experienced in another field before studying statistics, and the concept that statistics is inherently a graduate level subject are inventions that fitted the era when widespread application of statistical methodology was only a futuristic vi sion, occurring at the dawn of the computer age in a period of heavy research funding. all of these characteristics have gradually changed. it is time to adopt some new cultural norms that are more in tune with the external and internal problems that statistics now faces. these things are at the heart of many of the most severe problems in the field of statistics today. in my opinion, our current marketing approach in the field of statistics is dooming us to perpetual status as “hangers on” to the mainstream of society. instead, i hold out to you a wider view of ourselves: a vision of people trained as statisticians occupying jobs at the center, a unifying force in the mainstream of society, working together with people trained in other mainstream technologies that use the scientific method. consultant statisticians also will have their greatest influence if they operate at the center of the mainstream, using the principles of “total involvement” that i have espoused else where. so we come to the essential questions: what should the role of the statistician be? what is the confluence, the flowing together, of the unique characteristics of the discipline of statistics and the market opportunities? the unique characteristic is that statistics is the generic field of technology, among all the disciplines that use the scientific method. from this perspective, all other fields are special cases for specific subject matter, and the unify ing concept is the scientific method. the scientific method is an inherent part of all experimental sciences. statistics is the discipline responsible for studying the scientific method with the greatest intensity and for providing in depth expertise to other disciplines. if we are willing to accept this role, we must also accept the responsibilities that go with it. nobody is going to lay this role in our lap. we must go out and work for it. but we can only do so if we properly understand what we must expect of ourselves. as ed deming has so aptly said in the context of quality and productivity, the problem is that so many workers at all levels of organizations do not understand what their jobs are. i will discuss briefly the implications of this role in three specific areas: the education of statisticians the role of applied statisticians the role of the statistical association. some changes in statistical education would be required under the role model i have described. to begin with, the general public throughout their educational experience in grades k 12 would learn a variety of statistical concepts and tools and would emerge from their school years fully able to use effectively many simple statistical tools, especially graphics tools, in everyday life. they would carry these skills into their work environments and use them there. those who go on to college would continue to develop these skills. especially at the college level, and most especially for those who select statistics as their baccalaureate major, their view of the role of statisticians would be different from before. some of these changes in statistical education are al ready beginning to take place, and i am pleased to report that the statistical association is taking a leadership role. but more needs to be done. the single most important change that i would suggest in statistical education would be in the first introductory college level course, statistics 101. its focus would be to teach a system concept of the discipline of statistics in relation to the scientific method. the course would be organized around the operational sequence of steps in the scientific method. the first major theme would bedeliberate experimentation as a strategic approach to examine a target environment. this first theme includes as subtopics (a) defining the goals of the experiment, (b) defining the target environment in relation to the goals of the experiment, for example, is the purpose to identify important variables or to optimize a response? (srruregy of experimentation, 1975), (c) defining the controlled factors and the observed response in relation to the goals of the experiment, and (d) clarifying the issues involved in cases in which the structure of the data cannot be prespecified. other major themes include issues in collecting the data recording and manipulating the data analyzing and displaying the data creating predictive models from the data (this includes both the model development and model criticism phases) making inferences from the data presenting results to customers monitoring marketplace adequacy of services and results formulating new concepts leading to new experimentation in relation to a new target environment in a continuing iterative sequence. this introductory course can teach many of the elementary statistical methods usually taught in a first course, but their presence must support the main theme. from this perspective, the individual statistical methods are viewed as tools or component elements in an overall systems approach. the systems approach is the embodiment of the scientific method. it draws structure and subject matter from such fields as epistemology, philosophy of science, strategic marketing, management science, psychology and dynamics of people interaction, organizational effectiveness, and, of course, statistical methodology. it is obvious how a statistical study to design an experiment fits into this systems framework. it is almost equally obvious that a survey such as a population census, or an opinion poll, or a medical epidemiology study all fit into this systems framework. in every case, the viewpoint of the scientific method disciplines us to define clearly the goals, the target environment, the controlled factors, and the observed response. but the systems view of the scientific method helps us even in such seemingly simple applications as a shewhart control chart for an industrial process. too often, applications of such simple tools have fallen short of their potential. for example, every control chart application should include explicit definition of the target environment, the controlled factors, the observed response, and the sampling plan. the graphical control chart itself can be misleading in its apparent simplicity. how many practitioners understand the strengths and the limitations of the mathematical model that is embedded in the chart, the operating characteristics that are implied by the action lines, or the diagnostic strengths and weaknesses of the embedded sequence plot of the data? i believe a systems viewpoint of statistics in relation to the scientific method can elucidate the issues in all applications, including such seemingly simple ones as control charts. students will come to this introductory college level statistics course already familiar with simple statistical concepts and tools from their experience in grades k 12. students, when they emerge from this introductory course, will have the perspective that the discipline of statistics deals with the central issues of the mainstream of life the statistician’s role is at the center, fully comparable in visibility and influence to the role of other main stream technologies individual statistical methods are related to each other and to the discipline, in terms of where and how the methods fit into the overall systems concept. this unifying concept will then enable faculty to shape subsequent course offerings and students to digest course understandings so that they elucidate their role in the systems framework. subsequent courses can then get into fine points of detail in a given area without losing perspective on the whole process. subsequent courses can delve more deeply into the intricacies of the scientific method in various contexts. for example, discussions of the assumptions required for valid application of a statistical method should be seen as one facet of applying the scientific method. 10. role of applied statisticians changes in the life of many applied statisticians are required under the role model i have described. in this role model, applied statisticians cannot operate simply as shoe clerks (bross 1974). statisticians must become entrepreneurs. by this i mean that statisticians cannot simply sit and wait for a client to come in and request a multiple regression analysis, or a time series analysis. instead, those statisticians and statistical service organizations who do consulting are responsible foridentifying the statistical services needed by clients convincing clients to tackle problems developing proposed solutions (on statistical and re convincing clients to implement the resultslong term monitoring of performance of solutions total cost control of services. likewise, those persons originally trained as statisticians whose current job function is within the line organization will bring these systems concepts to bear in carrying out their work. in every case, the applied statistician, especially the consultant statistician, must develop the self image of an entrepreneur. the entrepreneur statistician will define the lated aspects) business, identify the market to be served, develop a marketing plan, and sharpen and shape the statistical tools to fit the market. moreover, the entrepreneur statistician will be sure to know the client’s products, business, and technical problems; the client’s people at all levels; and the technology of the client’s products and services (marquardt 1979, 1981). let me cite two illustrative examples of our failure to act as entrepreneurs in statistics. does the computer center in your organization have a “help desk” for computer users to give advice on use of statistical packages and the like? have you stopped to think that that help desk is one of the most useful points of entrance into the important statistical markets of your organization? who is assigned to the help desk? is it even a statistician? if the clients en counter a shoe clerk approach, we are telling them that is what statistics is all about. we have no one to blame but ourselves. and now, the “help desk” situation has exploded into a bigger and much more complex problem with the proliferation of decentralized computing hardware and the emergence of expert systems as a functioning reality. we have a major challenge ahead to build into these software/ hardware creations the systems approach to the scientific method. for example, let me remind you that the people writing many of these software systems are not highly trained and experienced statisticians. here, again, is the help desk problem in a new guise. what a field day this could be for teams of theoretical and applied statisticians and software experts! and yet we have so few teams on the field that we are in danger of losing by default. one of the implications of accepting an entrepreneurial role at the center of the mainstream is a responsibility to consider the consequences of our guidance to clients and colleagues. i have emphasized on other occasions that the management of the quality of a product or service requires equal attention to three interrelated facets: 1. the quality management philosophy that underlies the operation of the enterprise, ideally expressed in a for mal policy 2. the management systems that are used to achieve, monitor, improve, and control the financial and human relations performance of the enterprise 3. the technology systems and, in particular, the statistical methodologies that are used to achieve, monitor, improve, and control the quality of the products or services produced by the enterprise. within the third facet, the technology facet, most real problems can be solved adequately with any of several variations of statistical methodology. in their role as systems guides to resolving tough, fuzzy issues, statisticians who take an entrepreneurial approach have discovered that some technically acceptable statistical approaches en courage complementary improvements in the philosophy and management systems facets of the client’s enterprise. other, equally good technical approaches tend to cause counterproductive responses in the other facets. these “report card” consequences should be carefully analyzed and anticipated by statisticians in developing their recommendations and guidance to clients. 11. the four summarizing themes i have examined several ways in which this expanded perspective should have an impact on the education of statisticians and the role of applied statisticians. there are many other issues to be considered in an overall game plan. i want to leave with you four summarizing themes: 1. the importance of statisticians is that they should be systems guides to tough, fuzzy issues wherever the collection and interpretation of data should be involved. 2. the fundamental role of statisticians is to be purveyors of the scientific method. this is the common intellectual content that unites all statisticians. although practicing statisticians should have an understanding of general statistical methodology, including distribution theory, probability, and inference, and be skilled in such widely used methodologies as regression analysis, variance analysis, experimental design, and sampling procedures, no one statistical methodology is decisive as common intellectual content for all statisticians. 3. the business of statistics is the marketing of the scientific method. specific statistical methods are products within the business of statistics. as with other technical disciplines, we find some statisticians are generalists whereas others become specialists in certain products. 4. the challenge to applied statisticians is to become entrepreneurial practitioners and consultants in the scientific method. radical as these themes may sound in terms of the every day behavior of many statisticians, they really are totally consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of our field. for example, they epitomize the approach taken by early statistical leaders such as karl gauss and ronald fisher (1925) and by recent presidents of the asa who have operated in a diversity of application areas such as w. allen wallis, leslie kish (1978), george box (1979), and others. on a theoretical and philosophic basis the subjects of the philosophy of science and the foundations of statistics are, in principle, indistinguishable except, possibly, for areas of emphasis in describing or developing the bases for the scientific method (see encyclopedia britannica 1975). on an applied basis it does not matter that the scientific method is not a fixed, immutable set of concepts and procedures. it embodies a unifying philosophic and procedural basis. applied statisticians, theoretical statisticians, and philosophers can make the journey together cooperatively, with far better results than if they attempt their journeys separately, toward separate destinations. finally, i must say a few words about how all this relates to the statistical association. in 1985 we began a broad based strategic planning effort. the 1985 and 1986 boards of directors have been the primary participants, with contributions from sections, committees, chapters, and council. in the june 1986 issue of amstat news, i co authored with past president john neter and president elect barbara bailar a description of the strategic planning path and where we are today. twenty one common interest groups were identified in the strategic planning. these common interest groups are market segments that the asa must serve. they encompass a wide range from academics in statistics departments to federal government statisticians, industrial statisticians, teachers in grades k 12, users of statistical software, the general public, and 15 other groups. in our strategic planning we reaffirmed that the asa has responsibilities to all of these groups and must provide services suited to the needs of all of these groups. this requires a marketing approach with products and services that are different for the different groups. many of the high priority activities will be publications and other services targeted for research oriented statisticians trained at the graduate level, but we should provide also for priority needs of other practitioners. the asa has a very large number of activities already under way for most of the common interest groups. we set up three task forces on organizational flexibility, on programs, and on interactions with other organizations. these task forces have developed preliminary proposals for changes to re move obstacles and to create new opportunities for the asa to serve statisticians and their public. in the coming months the three presidents and the task force chairs will prepare an integrated document for strategic planning purposes. i hope the asa in the coming years can weave the themes of this article into all of these activities so that statisticians can achieve, and be perceived as deserving, a stature of high importance throughout our society.

Bailar","1970-1999","interaction a word often used by statisticians means a lack of independence among factors that characterize items or individuals. i will discuss the interactions among those of us involved in statistical practice and statistical research, and about our interactions with the wider world outside of statistics. i will discuss several kinds of interactions: those among ourselves as statisticians within asa; those with other disciplines; and those of statistics and statisticians with public policy, an informed citizenry, and the like. finally, i will look to the future and describe some promising new initiatives that are likely to improve our interactions as they expand the role and contributions of statistical think ing. people with a diversity of interests and backgrounds work together in asa’s sections, committees, chapters, and board of directors to achieve common goals. we tend to classify ourselves and each other in many different ways: by type of work we are research investigators and practitioners; by work setting we come from industry, government, and academe; by primary methodology we are skilled in time series, biostatistics, sample surveys, and so forth; by main activities we teach, collect, and analyze data; by training we have degrees at the ph.d., master, and bachelor level; and on and on. a clear profile of our association emerges from two sources of information the 1985 directory of statisticians and a survey of the membership carried out in 1985 by the committee on journal options chaired by bob groves (see groves 1985). first, we are a learned group as shown in figure 1. this distribution was somewhat surprising to me. many college and university graduates hold bachelor’s degrees in statistics, and many are doing statistical work, yet they are not members of the asa. we work in a variety of settings. in figure 2, included in the 45% academic members are students, about 7% of the asa. of the 19% working for the government all but about 3% work for the federal government. thus a little less than half of asa members are in colleges and universities, and a little more than half are in industry, government, or other nonacademic settings. the distribution also suggests that the asa is not attracting members from either the private sector or the government, especially state and local governments, in proportion to their numbers. consider next how we classify ourselves by major statistical activity. in the directory, members are asked to list no more than two activities in order of importance. figure 3 shows the percentages listing various activities. no one activity engages the talents of more than half of our members, though data analysis comes close; however, these activities vary considerably depending on where one works. figure 4 shows the two most frequent activities within each employment group. although data analysis is a primary concern of industry and government statisticians, only a quarter of academicians list that as a primary activity. none of these divisions would be important except that sometimes we tend to see certain groups as being more equal than others. but whom we see as the “real statisticians” depends on where we work and what we do. for some of us a “real statistician” must have a ph.d. for others, especially in government or industry, a “real statistician” must work on real problems that will contribute to more efficient operations, improved quality, or lower cost. in academe, a “real statistician” develops theory, but may not handle messy data. perhaps this is oversimplified a little, since many of us do many things, but we have all heard some groups called “ivory tower dreamers,” or others called “number crunchers.” who gets called by these pet names depends as much on the person talking as on the person being talked about. thus our great diversity, and the attitudes that accompany it, can create some real problems for us within asa. one problem is that we discourage some groups from membership. few of our members have a bachelor's degree as their highest degree. we have poor representation of government statisticians, particularly of statisticians in state and local government, and we have underrepresentation by statisticians in industry. that the asa does not meet certain needs is evident in our 78 chapters. these chapters are of different types. the great majority are in areas with one or more universities and draw most of their members from university faculty and graduate students. even those few members who work in industrial settings or health groups are likely to have close university links. virtually all members of these chapters are also asa members. a similar type of chapter is located in a state capital where there is also a university and where most chapter members are from the university, with only a few from the state government or industry. the university members are generally asa members, but those from the state government and industry are generally not. the program is dominated by the larger group, and the smaller group is not very active. we also have chapters in state capitals where there is no strong university interest and where the members are academic 45 % industrial government nonprofit, self employed10 20 30 40 50 primarily from state and local government. most of these chapter members are not asa members. they see no benefit from joining the asa. the rule that at least 50% of chapter members must be asa members has been discouraging to these chapters. one of our chapter presidents remarked as follows: the asa is by nature an elite organization. it is governed by volunteers such as yourself. those who have the strongest professional interest, who have the time for voluntary service, who may gain professionally from such service, and whose employers are sufficiently committed to the profession of statistics to permit, support, and even reward such activity, will predominate on the governing bodies. there is nothing wrong with this. the danger, however, is that the association may become an elitist organization. this can happen if those on the governing bodies fail to consider ways of bridging the gap between those operating at the leading edge of the profession, and those who are actually doing good things, but with a more limited repertoire of statistical skills. although asa has no specific membership requirements, it is clear that some are perceived. we need to be more sympathetic to the real problems of recruiting new kinds of members, helping them in their statistical work, and in turn learning how they can help us. some asa members believe that the selection of fellows illustrates an elitism within asa. figure 5 shows the distribution of fellows by workplace. when these figures are set next to the distribution of members by workplace, we find that members from academe are more than four times as likely to be fellows as those from industry. the ratios for government and the nonprofit categories are also low. i simply do not believe that this discrepancy reflects the distribution of asa members who can be shown to meet the standards for fellowship. i am not arguing that too many academicians become fellows our universities do have many qualified persons but that there are too few from other settings. being a full professor with a long list of publications is only one of many criteria by which we might select fellows. many other things are also important to the profession and to the discipline of statistics, such as using statistical methods to improve quality, increase production, or reduce costs. it is not fair to blame this distribution completely on the asa’s process for selecting fellows. perhaps it is harder to document contributions to applications than it is to list publications, but we should try. also, the committee on fellows can select only from those who are nominated, and there are many more nominations of those in academe than of those in industry or government. statisticians who work alone or with small groups may be known to no senior statisticians who could publicize their work. it is an effort to prepare a good nomination and obtain good sup port letters. despite these problems, we must make a real effort to get our private sector and government members recognized, while not neglecting the worthy efforts of our academic colleagues. finally, an issue that has been festering within asa for many years is one that goes under the name of journal options. should all asa members receive the same journals, or should members have some voice in which journals are covered by their membership fees? discussions of this topic have focused sharply on differences between practitioners and researchers. asa sponsors, either solely or jointly, five journals: the journal of the statistical association (jasa), the statistician, the journal of business & economic statistics (jbes), technometrics, and the journal of educational statistics (jes). asa also publishes several series of proceedings from the annual meeting. we expect jbes, technometrics, jes, and the proceedings to pay for themselves, but we all get jasa and the statistician whether we want them or not. jasa, the flagship journal of the asa, is clearly of excellent quality. the membership survey showed that more members approximately 82% considered the journals and publications to be a more important service of asa than any other activity. about one third of the membership thought asa should devote an even larger proportion of its resources to journals and publications. however, among survey respondents rating publications as very important, some 45% favored journal options. there is widespread support of our publications, even among those who rarely read them or submit articles to them. but despite the substantial support jasa enjoys in the association, jasa is a research journal. many of our members, and certainly many of our potential members, are involved in day to day applications work and do not want or need to read a broad range of research papers in each issue. members who are on the periphery of statistical research but use statistical techniques find that jasa is not relevant to those interests. yet being a member of asa is or could be of great benefit to these people. they need to talk to the rest of us, hear our papers, and ex change ideas with us; and we need just as much to hear from them. these statistical practitioners contribute in large measure to the statistics that affect our daily lives. they devise ways to deal with nonresponses in a survey that affects our pension funds. they develop quality assurance programs to improve the safety of the cars we drive. they study the demographic trends that can have profound im pacts on the construction of urban transportation systems, or the training of physicians, or the allocation of monies to combat poverty. there are those within the asa who say that jasa should define our membership and that all members receive jasa as a common bond. if jasa is to be used this way to define what we expect asa members to read and do and be, then jasa will in the end exclude academic 66% i from membership many persons who could substantially profit from and contribute to asa. this is not a role i want for jasa and why i can simultaneously be a strong supporter of jasa and a strong supporter of journal op let’s look a little more at jasa. about 19% of the membership have submitted at least one manuscript for publication during the last five years. of course, not every submitted article gets published, so fewer than one fifth of our membership has published in jasa in the last five years. who does publish in jasa? figures 6 and 7 show the distribution of papers by journal section in 1976 and 1986. applications papers have about the same proportion government nonprofit, other tions. figure 5. distribution of fellows by workplace. important differences in the use of articles between the applications section and the theory and methods section? i examined the citations in the science citation index for eight years after their publication. i began with 1975, but since the applications section had less than half the number of articles in the theory and methods section, i took two more years, 1976 and 1977. i saw such big year to year differences that i went back and took 1973 and 1974 as well. so the comparisons were made between. these results show no important differences in the use of articles between the two sections of jasa. i am concerned, however, that almost half of the articles in each section have never been cited, or have been cited only infrequently. of the articles cited only once or twice, the citations were often in later publications by the same perhaps a small shift to more papers from statistics departments rather than other departments. from 1976 to 1986, in theory and methods, the academic share remained about the same, but there was a big shift to more papers from statistics departments and fewer from other departments. part of the shift can be explained by the arrival on the scene of jbes; however, the inside cover of jbes says that its purpose is to publish articles dealing with applied problems in business and economic statistics. is jbes taking articles from jasa's theory and methods section? or is some thing else at work? another question is: are most jasa articles used often? are they of real service to statisticians? this is hard to get a handle on, so i used a proxy: how many times are articles cited in the science citation index? this is a poor substitute, because it records how often journal articles are cited in the bibliographies of other journal articles rather than how often people turn to an article to handle a specific problem. however, i assume that there is some positive correlation between the citation of an article by other re searchers and its value to users. on that basic premise, i used the science citation index to answer two questions: (a) are the articles in jasa being used? (b) are there thor. to sum up the journal options debate, i offer the following view. the intellectual argument against journal options is that asa needs a common core research journal to give members a shared awareness of new research developments. another argument is that the costs for jasa might go up if some members opt not to receive it. but this can happen only if there is a large decrease in the proportion of members receiving it a decrease not balanced by a growth in membership as we broaden our views of what asa is. those who favor journal options are likely to see the present jasa as a vehicle where academic statisticians publish highly theoretical articles, almost half of which are used infrequently. it seems to me that we have to stop linking the quarterly delivery of jasa, wanted or not, with asa membership. many journal outlets for statistics now exist, and individual asa sections may well develop their own new journals within the next few years to meet the special needs of their members. with the movements in quality and productivity, chemometrics, graphics, and statistical computing, to name a few, the asa is at the threshold of being able to offer publications that will appeal to many new people. journal options will allow asa to broaden its appeal to a wider membership and a membership that depends on applications. at its august 1987 meeting the asa board of directors voted to restructure jasa to broaden its appeal to the membership. the applications section will be renamed “applications and case studies” to underscore the idea that new methodologies are not required of manuscripts for that section. a general section that will encompass expository articles as well as book reviews will be added, and special topic sections will be published regularly. be cause it is believed that this new plan should be put in place and observed for some time to see if it accomplishes the goal of broadening the appeal of jasa, the board also decided not to consider journal options at this time. i hope the new plan will succeed. now let’s turn to some of our successes within asa. one of these successes is the way we sometimes work together on major problems of public policy. statistical thinking as well as statistical techniques and statistical data must play a large role in the evaluation of different policy actions. it is not enough for statisticians to view themselves as problem solvers; they must sit at the table when policy determinations are being made. public policy is too important to be left to politicians and advocates. one important public policy issue is what to do about the census undercount. the census bureau does a re markably good job of counting the population every 10 years, achieving about 98% 99% coverage; however, that small percentage of undercount is heavily concentrated in minority populations. the census bureau undercounts the black population at about a 5% rate, and the undercount rate for black males in certain age groups may be as high as 20%. the problem also affects hispanics, asians, and indians. after the 1980 census, the census bureau was sued by many states, cities, and towns asking for a statistical adjustment of the undercount. there were methods available to make an adjustment, but the application of those methods to the 1980 census would have been severely flawed, even to the point of distorting coverage further. soon after the 1980 census, a large and intense research effort to improve the measurement and the distribution of the undercount was launched by the census bureau, but this effort was not ours alone. over the last seven years, the census bureau has regularly reviewed its research and the implementation of its research in test censuses with the asa census advisory committee and with the panel on the decennial census appointed by the committee on national statistics. we have worked well together. statisticians have not only contributed to this technical work; many have also testified at various congressional hearings and in courtrooms, giving the benefit of statistical thinking to policymakers. this broad review of the issue, with the involvement of statisticians, users of census data, and representatives of the populations affected, as well as the interaction with lawyers and politicians, has made the undercount research and discussion one of the best efforts the census bureau has made. a sizable group of eminent statisticians now believes that adjustment of the coming 1990 census is feasible, that it has been successfully demonstrated in test censuses, and that it would substantially improve the accuracy of the 1990 census. those who press for adjustment say that an undercount in 1990 is inevitable, a view that the census bureau largely shares. they argue that even an imperfect adjustment will be a move in the right direction and will increase the accuracy of census data for its many uses. others caution that an adjustment might lessen participation in the census, and some still worry about the adequacy of the statistical techniques to make an adjustment. people on both sides of the argument hear selectively. many who favor adjustment, but do not understand the methodology, talk about how adjustment will take care of the problems of counting illegal aliens, people living in illegal housing, and the homeless. many who are against adjustment talk about the confusion of two sets of books, the danger of overadjustment, and the sapping of the will of people to be counted. both sides seem to forget that an adjustment is not a substitute for, but depends on, a good census; adjustment is a means to reduce a residual problem. finally, we should remember why an adjustment is even contemplated. mervyn dymally, chairman of the house subcommittee on census and population, said recently, “it is clear to me that we cannot ensure constitutional mandates of equal representation and the right to vote, nor begin to adequately address numerous social and economic problems, if the very numbers on which we base our fundamental policies are wrong” (dymally 1987). given that the census bureau does a very good job of covering the mainstream population, the consensus of the statisticians (statisticians from government, industry, and academe; statisticians who have carefully reviewed all of the work in this area) is that an adjustment will provide more accurate data on the size, location, and demography of the minority populations in this country. it’s time to get on with the job! another asa success has been in promoting inter changes among statisticians in the different sectors. though academics have routinely visited with each other, exchange has not been customary between academics and government, academics and industry, or industry and government. one positive force in this direction is the asa fellows program. this program, sponsored by the asa and partially funded by the national science foundation (nsf), began in 1978 at the census bureau. already 32 fellows and 25 research associates have worked at the census bureau for varying lengths of time. we have been fortunate in attracting top notch people who would probably not otherwise work in some of our problem areas; conversely, the participants have been able to use data that would not otherwise be available to them. the program has been evaluated by two different evaluation panels and lauded as a success. another indication of the success of the pro gram is that two more agencies the bureau of labor statistics and the center for education statistics have launched their own programs, modeled closely after the census bureau program. the department of agriculture also has a program, started in 1976, with different objectives and different funding, that has been bringing academics into work in the agency. these programs are important because they diminish the gap between academic and government social science; however, we need to do more. similar exchanges among other sectors could be as useful as the current programs. we need to involve state and local governments. now let’s look at our external interactions those with other disciplines, with politicians, and with the general public. many people use the tools of statistics statistics as a methodology for a variety of purposes in many different specialties. many others use statistics statistics as a set of facts to make important decisions on medical treatment, location of markets, and so forth. the statistics that government agencies and industries produce do influence our lives and the lives of the general public. even people who cannot pronounce the word statistics are influenced by the data we handle and the work we do. we need to better educate the rest of the world about the value of statistical thinking. the general public needs to understand the necessity for accuracy, relevance, and absolute integrity in the collection of data used in decision making in government and industry. but many statisticians, though very effective in their technical work, are ineffective in presenting that work to a nontechnical audience. statisticians must learn better communication skills. it takes hard work to make effective presentations to others who are not statisticians. communication about statistics is rarely taught at the universities. but we are the losers as individuals and as a profession when people just brush us off as unintelligible, narrow specialists. if statisticians are to be persuasive, they need opportunities to learn how to answer questions in illuminating ways; how to use graphs and charts to illustrate pertinent details; how to present technical ideas in clear, understandable layman’s language; and how to explain the relevance of methodology without getting mired in detail. problems are often evident when persons in other disciplines use statistical techniques. oftentimes a “cook book” approach is used, with no details about the gathering of data or the appropriateness of the techniques. a few journals (e.g., the new england journal of medicine and science) have added statistical reviewers to their ed. our universities to fill such needs. but the image of statisticians is not one that has people knocking on our class room doors. as robert samuelson stated, “in our society, if you love dogs, cats, or goldfish you’re considered normal and even nice. say a kind word for statistics and you’re regarded as a little mad”. our first problem is with numbers. we are not getting enough students into graduate curricula, though enroll ment in undergraduate statistics courses has grown rapidly in the last 25 years. from a survey done by the conference board of the mathematical sciences (cbms) we see the growth in undergraduate courses shown in figure 9. the difference between elementary and advanced courses is whether or not calculus is a prerequisite. the cbms speculated on the causes for these increases, but could find few facts. the cbms also estimated the number of statistics undergraduate degrees over time (as shown in fig. 10). thus we have more people graduating with under graduate degrees in statistics, but the number in statistics alone is scarcely equal to the average in the 1970s. there may be some growth with combined degrees, but not very much. there is also some evidence that teaching loads for statistics faculty are dropping and more courses are being itorial staffs‘. from a close association with the statistical reviewer for the new england journal of medicine, i know that the number of manuscripts he reviews has grown greatly over the years. this is largely because the editor and the rest of the staff came to see that statistical review is more than a matter of checking significance tests and the proper application of formulas. the whole design of studies and 1974 75 l5lll statistics joint math stat joint computer science stat 1979 80 the methods and implementation of data gathering are now reviewed carefully and as a matter of routine and not only by the statistical consultant. this change at just one journal took years of hard day to day work; however, we need more of this. a final problem, in our interactions with the outside world, is the need for a larger group of well trained, qualified statisticians. we desperately need more statisticians in government, management, and industry, and we expect taught by graduate teaching assistants, which brings us to another problem. the number of graduate students en rolled in mathematics, including statistics, has not been growing rapidly. in addition, a decreasing fraction of graduate students in mathematics are citizens (as shown in fig. 11). the proportion of graduate students from other countries rose from 24% of all math enrollments in 1977 to 40% in 1984. it is not that the total has increased by attracting new groups of foreign students; the number of students in mathematics dropped sharply about 10 years ago, and has not recovered. if foreign students stay in the u.s.a., the problem may not become acute; however, a significant percentage are on temporary visas and intend to return to their native lands. in addition, the significant increase in new mathematicians during the 1950s will lead to a wave of retirements in the next 15 years. our failure to attract more students also means that undergraduate courses are increasingly being taught by teaching assistants and others who may have problems speaking english. i certainly do not undervalue the contributions of the many statisticians from other countries. we may need even more of them, but we also need more students. the cbms report ended with saying that anecdotal evidence suggested that the situation was even more serious in statistics than in the mathematical sciences as a whole. if we do bring in more students, will the curriculum be adequate? in march i wrote an article for amstat news on the need for asa to have an office of scientific and public affairs. in that article, i mentioned the need to bring statistical thinking to bear on important problems. some of the letters i received in response to that article were from faculty members who deplored the fact that the colleges and universities were not teaching statistical think ing. they were teaching mechanical manipulations. one professor of statistics said, “if we want to improve public understanding of statistics, one place to start must be in the classroom. there we have people’s attention for at least a whole semester, and with the proper curriculum changes we should be able to develop a new and better understanding of statistics for generations of students.” part of the problem is that many of the people who teach, whether in undergraduate or graduate courses, have little or no practical experience in what they teach. their horizons are largely limited to what appears in journals and textbooks, including what their own teachers have taught from older textbooks. some of the best teaching i have seen comes when people who have had extensive practical experience tell students what happens when the underlying assumptions are not met, when there are data gaps, when data are censored, when results are needed immediately and on a tight budget, and so forth. students learn much more about how to confront data and what questions to ask when faced with real problems than when just learning techniques from textbook problems. if we cannot or do not produce well trained practitioners, we have failed the society that supports us. things are improving, and i want to mention some successes. in a few places faculty members have realized that the general public as well as other disciplines need a familiarity with statistical thinking, and some new courses are being developed to bring students the excitement of statistical detective work. instead of being turned off, the students get a greater appreciation of what statistics can do and how statisticians can help them in their future work. another success is the quantitative literacy program, run under the joint auspices of the asa and the national council of teachers of mathematics, with funding from the nsf. the aims of this program are to develop guide lines for the teaching of statistics and probability in the elementary and high schools, to develop a model program for training teachers in the concepts of statistics and the presentation of those concepts, to produce curriculum materials for teachers, and to develop a mechanism for evaluating the teaching of statistics and probability. since the program began, four substantial paperbound textbooks for elementary and high school students, each with a teach er’s manual, have been developed, tested, published, and used in a growing number of school systems. the examples used relate to things that primary and secondary school students are interested in, such as hit pop music recordings and home run leaders, but underneath is a serious approach to teaching a serious matter. teachers are being trained in the techniques so that more of them can teach these courses. this project has been so successful that asa recently received an nsf grant for quantitative literacy 11. this project will continue the work started. another kind of success has been the new winter conference. although the asa annual meeting seems very large, only 20% 25% of the membership attends any particular annual meeting. in the 1985 membership survey, 54% of our members said they had not attended a single annual meeting in the previous five years. a common reason for not attending is that employers do not pay for attendance at the annual meeting. the regional conferences are intended to attract a sizable number of people who do not attend the annual meeting, to give the chapters a larger role in planning the sessions, and to have more expository and tutorial kinds of papers. four hundred seventy seven people attended the first winter conference in january 1987 in orlando. just less than 10% were students, and 28% were from industry. about 12% were not members of any statistical organization. the sessions were well attended, and so were the two continuing education courses. another exciting development should both improve our interactions with other disciplines and improve the image of statistics. the annenberg project, with funding from industry and the corporation for public broadcasting, has begun producing a television course entitled “introduction to data analysis.” this course, with 26 half hour segments, will emphasize the importance of statistical think ing in nonacademic settings. david moore, the content developer, intends to focus on contemporary and relevant applications. the course is aimed at entry level under graduates as well as adults in continuing education. i am pleased that the board of directors agreed unanimously at the august 1987 board meeting that asa will cosponsor this project. now that i have described some of our internal and ex ternal interactions, let me look a short distance into the future. i see some exciting new interactions among our selves and with others, let me mention only two. one step toward improved interactions inside and out side asa is our further progress toward an asa office of scientific and public affairs (ospa). discussion about such an office has been going on for many years. an ospa would respond to five main categories of needs: education, clearinghouse, coordination, communication with statisticians, and publicity and promotion. although this office would be a part of the asa structure, all of our statistical societies have expressed support for such an office, and it would respond to the needs of statisticians everywhere. a committee representing all of the different asa sectors has been working on how to set up such an office, how to fund it, and what its initial priorities should be. the committee has done an excellent job, and i hope the office will soon be oden for business. [at its december search that cuts across disciplines will benefit both statistics and the other disciplines. the nsf recently expressed interest in funding science and technology centers. these centers will contribute to science by allowing researchers to take on bigger, longer term projects, and by assuring support teams. they will contribute to the rapid transfer of new knowledge and to the training of students with an eye to applications. asa has a small amount of funding from the nsf to examine the feasibility of a national institute of statistical sciences. although any proposals to the nsf for funding from the science and technology centers program would necessarily be from universities, asa is playing an important role in getting people to talk about the structure, programs, and financing of such an institute. if established, the institute would necessarily benefit our interactions with other disciplines and increase the benefits of graduate training in statistics. in conclusion, i have mentioned some problems as well as some successes and some new directions for asa. but the problems the diversity of membership, the role of our journals, the failure of other disciplines to understand and make the most of statistical concepts and methods, the need to train more statisticians at all levels are healthy. they are the accompaniment of growth and ferment; may such problems not cease. and they are much more than balanced by the new strengths new kinds of interchanges among academic, government, and industrial statisticians; our growing educational role and the increasing use of statistics, good statistics, to illuminate more and more subject areas; the prospects of a national institute of statistical sciences. all of these things are signs of a dynamic organization, one of which i am proud and honored to be a part. thank you for electing me to be your president.",307,19.3127035830619,4.94737729802665,0.241187384044527,5929,1430,16.2112409549924,11.2112409549924,32,1.41183675361846,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1988.10478559"
1988,"83rd","Hogg, Robert V.","Male","University of Iowa","Academia","148th","August 22–25, 1988","New Orleans, LA","Statistics in Biotechnology","How to Hope with Statistics",1988-08-23,"Robert V. Hogg","1970-1999","the title of this talk, how to hope with statistics, arises from the second international conference on teaching statistics held in victoria, b.c., two years ago. i was program chair of the conference and had all sorts of outstanding helpers. i acknowledged that help by working their names into bob hope's song, ""thanks for the memories."" for example: thanks for the memory, of fred leone and his gang who started with a bang built our association strong until its praises were often sang we thank you so much. after i did this in victoria, a swedish statistician, andrejs dunkels, who is a cartoonist, drew these two little characters. one asked, ""what's the name of bob hogg's next book?"" the other replied, ""how to hope with statistics."" of course, the ""hope"" in the cartoon referred to bob hope. but the more i thought about it, the more i realized that dunkels might be onto something: hope with statistics. there really is hope with statistics. i would like to discuss this tonight. in the last two or three years, i have flown in and out of washington's national airport several times, really more than i would have like. but there is one flight pattern i particularly enjoy taking off to the west and seeing the capitol, the washington monument, the white house, and the lincoln memorial on the right. it's a thrill for any the capitol and monuments of washington are symbols of america's hopes and its promises. but as i travel around this country in my duties as asa president, i often feel those promises are not being kept. this april, for example, carolyn and i drove through the south when we visited a few chapters in south carolina and georgia. the timing was perfect as the azaleas and dogwood were at their peak. we drove back through tennessee and kentucky, then towards st. louis. as we approached that city we could see the gateway arch, another symbol of this nation's hopes. but as we came closer, we drove through the squalor of east st. louis it struck me that there is not much hope there. another flight pattern around national airport that i like is landing after seeing mount vernon, then alexandria on the left. i can spot king street, with the masonic memorial at the end. over two streets is duke street. there's the church, the empty parking lot, then finally the new asa building. finding it is a thrill for a statistician, particularly one so heavily involved in that project. just as the monuments of washington are symbols of america's hopes, the new asa building is a symbol of the potential of statisticians. how can statisticians in education, in business and industry, and in government help solve our nation's problems? how can we help restore hope with statistics? let me begin with my favorite subject, education, by mentioning a 1940 report of the california department of education in which educators listed the seven top problems in the schools. they were talking, chewing gum, making noise, running in the halls, getting out of line, wearing improper clothing, and not putting paper in wastebaskets. i was in high school at that time, and i would say those were the major problems. in retrospect, it seems like a wonderful time. in 1980the survey was repeated; the top seven problems were drug abuse, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, suicide, rape, robbery, and assault. there is a great difference in those two lists; it shows that something is wrong. has america become such an old country that we cannot solve problems that are seemingly out of control like that of drugs? i hope not, although i do not see a clear solution of the drug problem. in particular, there is something wrong with the way science, mathematics, and engineering are being taught in america. one of the researchers for ""a nation at risk"" said, ""we are raising a new generation of s that is scientifically and technologically illiterate."" another report, ""the underachieving curriculum,"" compared math programs with those in other industrialized nations. u.s. student achievement was below average and student retention rates in mathematics programs were lower than those of other countries. it seems the japanese are educating engineers and scientists, while the u.s. is producing lawyers and accountants. universities have responded by filling empty seats in math and science classes with foreigners. the national research council reported in february 1988 that in the years 1983 to 1985, more than half of the engineering professors in universities under age 35 and more than 60 percent of engineering doctoral students were foreign. today, we know the figures are even higher. i am not against the foreign born because this nation has accepted them and benefited from them since about 1620. foreigners must be welcome at universities. they expose students to other cultures and help them consider the state of their own society. but postgraduate education cannot continue to depend on foreigners to fill classrooms as teachers and students. we must encourage more born to become scientists. foreigners, after all, will not necessarily continue to come to america to study and teach. many who do study here are now returning to their homelands to expand educational opportunities there. some day programs may offer no advantages to foreign students when compared with programs in their own countries. and, of course, many foreigners should return to their native lands, not because s don't want them here, but because their countries need their expertise to help overcome problems like poverty and widespread deprivation. but postgraduate education is also increasingly important to the economy. no longer will america's giant domestic market, cheap raw materials, and mass production guarantee prosperity. we need highly educated people to innovate and to adapt to a changing world. yet only a few actions have been taken to encourage s to undertake postgraduate math and science education. many more are needed. for example, more fellowships are needed for math, science, and engineering graduate students, and the stipends they receive need to be higher. currently a teaching assistant at iowa makes about $7,000 after paying tuition. this does not compare favorably to the initial salary of more than $30,000 for a beginning engineer. moreover, the recipients of the fellowships should not be taxed, as the president and congress, in their great wisdom, decided. that's crazy. but monetary reforms will not get at the real problem. we want students and teachers devoted to quality and learning. the key is to show that mathematics and science can contribute significantly to the welfare of our country. educators should share with students the importance of these subjects. they then become interesting. statisticians can really help here by clearly demonstrating that math and science are not just mental gymnastics. but sometimes statistics is taught in a way that can kill the imagination. statistics: a guide to the unknown was a great title for those essays written by statisticians associated with our asa nctm (national council of teachers of mathematics) committee on curriculum, at that time chaired by fred mosteller. i wish we would teach our subject in that spirit as a guide to the unknown. that's what statistical thinking is about. toward this end, we have done a few things already. our quantitative literacy program, also an outcome of the joint asa nctm committee, has developed materials that can be used in grades 7 12. these are excellent data oriented statistical methods, and many teachers have been trained to use them. we must, and will, do more working in even lower grades to demonstrate clearly to very young children that science can be interesting and useful. they must also understand that, regardless of their financial status, sex, color of their skin, they will have the opportunity to go to college and become engineers, mathematicians, doctors, and so on provided they prepare themselves academically. if we cannot make such a promise to those children in grade schools, then the professionals in this association better try to see that the system is changed. i believe that providing equal educational opportunities gives this country the best chance for true equality of its citizens. a wasted mind is a terrible thing; we must prevent that. in colleges and universities we are now questioning the type of statistics courses given to liberal arts majors, to business students, to engineering students, and to others. there have been important conferences held on statistical education for engineering and business students. the quality of products has been a driving factor behind some of these sessions. new books addressing the recommendations of the conferences have been and are being written. i hope more will follow. i was very much involved in the conference for engineers, which will be followed by a second one next spring to be chaired by neil ullman. i want to emphasize the importance of such projects on improving statistical education. those involved in the engineering conference came to recognize the importance of having knowledge of the omnipresence of variability; the high value of graphical analysis; the essentials of statistically designed experiments; basic statistical inferences; and the philosophies of shewhart, deming, and others concerning the delivery of quality products and services. we must continue to stress the need for selective changes in our search for the optimal programs. it is my thought that statistics majors should see more applications and total quality management techniques than they do at present. they really learn nothing about management; yet many will be involved in it later. as a matter of fact, many of us could benefit from the use of good managerial procedures. our academic programs can also suggest the need for using statistics in policy making, with students recognizing the value of good statistical measures in assessing characteristics of various projects benefiting our country. moreover, they should know something about the ""cost and benefit game"" of funding some programs and not others. statisticians can play major roles in shaping policy, and our students must realize this. we should not simply be training statistical technicians. we must broaden our goals. this means we must change our curricula. in graduate studies, we need to create real communities of scholars. one way to move in this direction is to have projects on which the faculty and graduate students can work. the space program at iowa is an example of such a project. while our statistics group will probably never have anything that big, we are trying to get smaller projects with john deere, rockwell collins, and amana. iowa does not have a lot of industry; we must reach out. we are! we have made a substantial contact with ford and would like to talk to others. however, i make this plea not only for iowa, but for all universities to establish stronger academic/industrial relationships. this country really needs more advanced institutes, vehicles through which young ph.d.'s can interact with senior scientists. the statistical societies are exploring ways to fund one or more institutes in statistical sciences. already arnold zellner has made one excellent and very substantial proposal to nsf. in these institutes, there should be involvement by people from universities, industry, business, and government working on truly crossdisciplinary projects. this approach is needed to ensure that we solve the right problems and that there is relevance in the results. in addition, sabbatical programs not just in academia, but in business, industry, and government must be expanded. people in the latter fields might exchange positions with professors in universities. in this changing world, everyone including workers must have some opportunity for continuing education. many short courses in quality control and statistics are given. are they the best? are they really enhancing the competitiveness of u.s. industry? we must ask this not only about the short courses, but about all continuing educational activities. at least by asking, we suggest that we could improve and we probably can in most instances. on the job education is extremely important; let's do it well. we have started to make substantial changes in education; let's continue those and do more, always recalling that learning must be gratifying. one reason that there are too few students who want to study and teach math and science is that learning in these areas is not enjoyable. unfortunately, most students see studying as something people have to do, not something they want to do. this situation must change. it is not solely the teacher's responsibility to make learning interesting. students need to work hard. parents need to be involved and respect teachers. if something isn't enjoyable, people need to have the courage to say it need 3 not be that way. in a certain sense, as my son says, ""it should be fun."" and, indeed, it could be. that is the key to continued progress in mathematics and science education. while education is our hope in the long run, more immediate gains can be made in business and industry. consider the 1920s, when the british bought lots of well made products like tires and patent leather shoes. henry ford, harvey firestone, and others started plants in england to avoid the tariffs. then, after world war ii, british industry began to decline. today we buy well made japanese products. the japanese are, in turn, buying industries even firestone. with the dollar down, they are cheap. what will happen to industry? are we headed for a similar decline? as business becomes bigger, quality suffers. the human aspect in the quality process is forgotten. workers should enjoy their work, use their talents satisfactorily, grow in their employment, and see how they have contributed to the final product in some responsible way. people's prides need that sort of recognition. ""too big"" has forced many of my friends into retirement because work is not fun anymore. let us recognize our faults and difficulties and get busy and try to solve them in the best way that we can. president reagan once implied we could cure america's problems the john wayne way that is, through ""true grit"": holding our shoulders back, standing tall and making zero defectives today. but alone, ""true grit"" is not the answer. workers have not changed and they operate the same old machines as yesterday. they need help, or as ed deming says a road map. clearly, we must change. but how? there is where statistics can help why there is ""hope with statistics."" collect information. analyze data. explore more with carefully designed experiments. analyze again and again. use the scientific method statistics is at its heart. statistical thinking can direct change in industry. product and process designs must use statistical design of experiments. a good process can be listened to with shewhart techniques and extensions of them. take action and make changes when appropriate. if the results of a process are not optimum, consider evolutionary operation the famous evop of box and draper or other appropriate statistical procedures. make the changes in a direction that approaches an optimum. we will never get there, but we must continue to try. while considering quality improvement, i must note that two members of the association sent me copies of an article that was in the new york times concerning ""improving quality, the japanese way"" on july 20, 1988. it suggested that genichi taguchi had invented design of experiments, statistical quality control, and loss functions. moreover, it implied that the traditional statistical method for searching for an optimum was to ""change one factor at a time."" hogwash. what about r. a. fisher, walter shewhart, and the many other fine statisticians who had 4 worked in these areas? i was mad and, as president of asa, i responded to this with a letter to the editor. members of our association must react to situations that are wrong and make suggestions on how to improve them. in recent years, sometimes with the urging and help of my sons, i have done much more of this, writing letters or even guest editorials. i really wish that i had done more in my younger years. i mention this to encourage many younger and smarter statisticians in asa to be more involved in many of the important problems of today. this country needs your help. business and industry must realize we now have a global market really one marketplace. it doesn't matter where you live; you buy the best from that one market. this requires a world class product of high quality, sold at a reasonable cost, delivered in a timely fashion. many of these products will have short life cycles. this suggests small batch production from flexible, high quality, often small industries, many of which will use robots. these changes in industry create the need for new and special, possibly highly automated, statistical techniques. it is difficult to change. many business persons remember the ""happy days"" of the early 1950s. their sons and daughters, now in control of those businesses, want those days back. even bob hogg wants the ""statistical good news of hogg and craig"" to go on forever. but statistical theory and methods are changing and so are demands in business and industry, too. still, the national research council's manufacturing studies board in the october 1986 issue of news report indicates that the majority of u.s. companies are clinging to their old ways: ""others should change, not me."" ""you must be referring to my neighbor."" we must learn to give up short term gains for long term good. the statistical profession might also help in finding solutions for other problems of our country, many of which, of course, are related to troubles in education and industry. this country is really one big system to analyze. this is exactly the type of situation in which statisticians should be utilized. there is the trade deficit. the u.s. is now the greatest debtor nation. we owe about 500 billion dollars to foreigners now and may owe 2 trillion by 1995. products are being bought now because they are cheaper, not necessarily better. there is not enough savings; we are living beyond our means as a nation and as individuals. productivity and quality are not increasing substantially; the u.s. has a lower growth rate than any major industrialized nation. businesses are paying big dividends, but not modernizing industry. we have the nicest homes of any industrialized country, but the oldest factory machinery. differences between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" are increasing. do executives really deserve more than 50 times the income of their workers? there are urban problems like crime, gangs, poor transportation, aids, and homelessness. (even iowa city has a few homeless people now.) he health care system needs a major overhaul. • there are environmental difficulties like acid rain, nu clear fallout, smog, water pollution, and erosion. those not living in farm states might not be aware of how names of herbicides have changed. they once had innocent names like atrazine and treflan; now they have action names like command, prowl, round up, and counter. i look for herbicides called obliterate and annihilate in the future to fight an ever growing stable of weeds like woolly cupgrass, black nightshade, and lambsquarters. what are the new, more powerful herbicides and insecticides doing to our water? if i were president not of the asa, but of the u.s.a. i would get a team of outstanding persons, including lots of scientists and, of course, statisticians. the team would first list all possible programs: for the military, for agriculture, for the environment, for economic development, for the development of energy, for health care, for education, et cetera. the team would then assess the importance of each of these programs; assign some utilities, if you like. i wouldn't even mind a few probabilities where appropriate. here we will have some disagreements. that's good; the team members must think hard. compromises are needed. we also need the best possible statistical measures of each situation. then, and only then, can we truly start doing the right thing for our country. our new president clearly needs a scientific adviser who has his respect and his ear and i would like that person to be of cabinet rank. for example, take the space program manned or unmanned flights? or should we forget the entire program and spend our money elsewhere? certainly this is a real possibility. costs must be listed as carefully as possible, along with the benefits. let's compare the challenger disaster and the unmanned pioneer 10, which was launched in 1972 and is now over 4 billion miles in space. it was the first craft to reach jupiter and is still sending information back. play the ""cost and benefit"" game. the answer is clear, except to a few persons who need the glamor and thrill of manned space flights to hold their interest. so, according to hogg, we should have unmanned flights. obviously, some disagree. possibly a harder decision is ""how many?"" including zero as a possible answer. after all, this program competes with all other programs. that is what this assessment is all about. it's difficult; we need the advice of experts based upon good, solid statistical measures and decision rules. i do not pretend to be an expert on this or any other program i have mentioned. as a matter of fact, i recognize that many in this audience know much more about statistics than i do. so, as i tell my students, possibly i do not know what i am talking about; but if i did, i would be right. i am certainly not the first to suggest the need of valid statistical measures. while writing this speech, i thought of the fine letter florence nightingale wrote to francis galton in 1891on the subject of a university professorship in statistics. in that she mentions problems concerning food, education, child labor, crime, workhouses, and other troubles of that day. she pleas ""for some teaching how to use these statistics in order to legislate for and to administer our national life with more precision and experience."" as a nurse, she was concerned about people. karl pearson makes the following observation about her: florence nightingale believed and in all the actions of her life acted upon that belief that the administrator could only be successful if he were guided by statistical knowledge. the legislator to say nothing of the politician too often failed for want of this knowledge. nay, she went further: she held that the universe induding human communities was evolved in accordance with a divine plan; that it was man's business to endeavor to understand such a plan and guide his actions in sympathy with it. but to understand god's thoughts, she held we must study statistics, for these are the measures of his purpose. thus the study of statistics was for her a religious duty. (oh, how i wish my students would study statistics with that sort of conviction.) obviously we cannot cure all ills with statistics. however, the statistical profession has not done a very good job communicating with the general public about what can and cannot be done with statistical techniques. too often people think that statisticians put all the emphasis on the averages not recognizing that we are very much interested in the study of variation. i have often suggested that more statisticians should even enter politics. i have kidded certain of my friends about becoming senators, congressmen, governors, and mayors. the titles actually appealed to some of them, but they had never thought of it before. tonight, we recognize our new fellows of asa. maybe they will be such leaders the sort of leaders to show the country how to hope with statistics. but i'm asking not just them, but each of you to be this kind of leader. statisticians like you, dick anderson. yes, i know you are a professor emeritus doing some consulting and trying to cut down on work a little. but you have the energy you are articulate and an effective statistical communicator. when is the last time that you called on a high school math or science teacher? asked if those students would like to hear about some good applications involving important projects? do it soon, dick. but as good as you are, dick, possibly it might be more important for our women, our minorities, and our disabled to visit high schools or even grade schools. how about maria gonzalez? kimmy bowman? allan sampson? you 5 might believe that you cannot do much by talking to one or two classes in a high school or a small college. however, if you can capture one inquisitive mind for statistics or, more generally, the mathematical sciences you have had a very successful day. i will contact lynn steen, chairman of the conference board of the mathematical sciences, to see if we cannot create some massive informal visitation effort in high schools and colleges. if you can't become a congressman, try to influence one. if you can't become a senator, try to support the ones who can do the greatest good. if you don't become a governor, try to help create ""quality communities"" within your state. if you can't be a mayor, help with the troubles of the city; it's a big statistical problem involving assessment. even if you're not president of a school board, try to stimulate better math and science education in your community. champions of causes, pioneers, leaders are in demand. decide tonight that you will be one of them. make a commitment. statistics will help; it is a guide to the unknown. there is hope with statistics. i'll write the book: how to hope with statistics. but you know about it already and do not need to read it. lt has been a great honor for me to be your president. it's lots of work, but it's always enjoyable meeting with you on my many visits around the country. one person as president can do very little, a point that i have discussed with dick anderson a number of times. but if each of you would decide to do a little more to hope more with statistics, we would be better off and i would have been somewhat successful. so if you see a problem, try to do something about it. be a florence nightingale get involved because as statisticians we can help, even if only 5, 10, or 15 percent of an appropriate team. as i close, i hear that echo from another recent convention, changed somewhat: hope with statistics, hope with statistics, hope with statistics, hope with statistics! like a locomotive in the night! who are its engineers, its leaders? let them be you and me with the help of our friend, statistics. thanks for the memories, i really hate to part i've loved it from the start please hope with statistics from the bottom of your heart i'd thank you so much.",321,14.0903426791277,4.80256466946717,0.296042449701526,4523,1339,13.3187644872211,8.31876448722108,61,1.18266653561722,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1989.10478728"

Norwood","1970-1999","one hundred fifty years ago, when the statistical association (asa) was founded, statistics had yet to be recognized as an organized discipline, the descriptive information about the state of the world was incomplete and relatively unscientific, the country had no unified comprehensive data base, and the federal statistical system as we know it today did not exist. the four population censuses that had been carried out were the responsibility of u.s. marshals who added the enumeration chore to their law enforcement activities. some states sponsored survey work on income and production, but the methods used were primitive and the data were incomplete. from its beginning, the purpose of our association and, for that matter, of the field of statistics in this country at that time was to develop and disseminate facts about society. it was not until much later that the organization's attention expanded to include theory and methods involving statistical inference, variability, error structure, and methods of data analysis. what kind of information was there and how was it disseminated in the middle of the nineteenth century? we can find some evidence of the spread of numeracy from the farmer's almanac (1839), a publication addressed largely to the heavily rural population. the almanac for 1839, the year of the asa birth, which was ""fitted for boston,"" but believed relevant ""for the adjoining states,"" was interspersed with tables of all kinds. one can learn, for example, that the president of the united states was paid $25,000 a year, and that the secretary of war was the highest paid cabinet officer ($6,600). we also can find the vacation dates between april and august of all nine of the new england colleges and that was before seasonal adjustment of the summer youth labor force data. we can also find the 1830 census count of 12.9 million people, the names of 16 ""broken banks"" in new england, and information on the distances from one town to another, measured as miles from ""one established tavern to another."" some states collected data about the economic activities within their borders. and even then, concerns over data quality were raised, concerns that sound familiar today. the massachusetts official under whose direction economic data were compiled in the mid 1850s, for example, citing the ""intimate connection"" between survey responses and the ""assessment of taxes,"" concluded that the survey's downward bias of production figures amounted to ""considerable over $1,000,000 per day for every working day of the year"" (moore and coolidge 1857, p. 34). we have come a long way since those pioneering days. throughout the entire life of the statistical association, statistics have been an important tool in our thinking about society and its government. those who sought to understand and to direct social change demanded ""facts,"" and statistics have become inextricably intertwined with public policy. from the basic counts of free men and slaves in our early censuses of population, through the expansion of information on the social, health, and economic condition of our population, statistical science has been used to define, explain, and evaluate some of the most complex problems that society faces. sometimes, the conditions developed first, the need for data was recognized, and statistics became a requirement for the effective design of public policy. at other times, the statistics that had already been developed suggested the need for policy development. of course, we have always used statistical data to evaluate the effectiveness of political action, but in recent years we have come more and more to use statistics for policy implementation and for resource allocation. i would like to review just three of the many strands of interaction between statistics and public policy to note what that interaction has meant and to see what lessons we might learn. this is a broad and complex field, and i shall select but a few examples drawn, not surprisingly, in the public domain from the labor statistics area, the field with which i am most familiar. that focus is particularly relevant, however, since labor statistics was one of the first of the fields of federal government statistics to develop, having started with carroll wright, the first commissioner of labor, in 1884. and, as many of you may know, it was colonel wright who began the asa tradition of an annual presidential address. wright did this in 1908, after more than a decade as asa president (wright 1908). i have great admiration for commissioner wright and agree that we should continue the custom of having presidential addresses, but let me assure you that i believe a one year term as president of asa is quite long enough! a number of principles were established by colonel wright, among them the view that objective data are essential to the intelligent formulation of public policy. before the turn of the century, his bureau had collected and analyzed statistics on industrial depressions, strikes, machinery, production cost, prices, wages, and working conditions. working women one of the earliest of those efforts covered working women in large cities; the study was done in 1888. this was the time of the influx of foreign labor, the rapid development of factories, and the migration of workers from the farms to the cities all developments that rapidly increased women's participation in the paid labor force (chafe 1972). to provide information on the conditions in which these women worked and lived, commissioner wright's bureau conducted interviews with nearly 17,500 women and visited both their work environments and their living quarters. the survey was considered ""representative"" (u.s. bureau of labor 1889, p. 9) because it covered 6% 7% of the total universe. the policy issues covered were as social, even moral, as they were economic. the bureau reported, not surprisingly to us, that ""the statistical method is not the best under which to determine moral conditions; yet, as an auxiliary, it has great efficiency"" (p. 73). the report complained, for example, that women workers living in rooming houses had to receive guests in their rooms because there was no other place to meet them. ""such a condition tends either in the direction of crushing out social intercourse, especially between the sexes, or of carrying it beyond the limit of prudence,"" the report said (pp. 14 15). bureau interviewers noted that ""working women are not street walkers. they could not carryon their daily toil and walk the streets too"" (p. 77). as was the custom at that time, the report presented a massive array of tables. the average weekly earnings for women was only $5.24. the bureau report said, ""the figures tell a sad story, and one is forced to ask how women can live on such earnings"" (p. 70). the report concluded that women ""could only displace men because they were willing to work for less wages"" and reflected the belief that ""she will gain step by step as she becomes more valuable .. but the gain will be slow"" (p. 72). much has happened in the century since that survey was done. more and more, it has been clear that, then as now, working class, minority, and immigrant women have often had to work to help support their families. as the years passed, however, more women entered the labor force and a considerable number of them, especially in the period following world war ii, remained at work. the national labor force survey, begun in the late 1940s, has provided a description of their employment status. but change comes slowly in our society, and it seems clear that the country was not yet ready to approve of the changes reflected in the data. in this country, we have learned that statistics inform but rarely change social attitudes. public acceptance of these changes came only some decades later, when larger than ever numbers of married middle class women entered the labor force and remained at work after their children were born. laws aimed at preventing discrimination in the workplace were passed, and the women's movement grew in size and strength. as these developments occurred and society's attitudes began to change, more demands were placed upon the statistical system. ""the availability of data made discussion of such issues as male female pay equity possible. the availability of statistical information on the number of working women and on the conditions under which they worked helped to inform the country of the change that was taking place. without the data, society's acceptance of what, in fact, had already happened would have taken a much longer time. it is probably also true that the recent controversial discussions on comparable worth could not even have taken place without the long time series data on occupations and earnings tabulated by sex that come from our labor force survey. in many ways, the national debate on work family issues has only just begun, but the data base for intelligent discussion of the issues is now in place. unemployment the counting of the unemployed has moved along quite a different course. although many factory workers lost jobs during periods of reduced economic activity even before the statistical association was founded, very few attempts at measurement had been made. in fact, the phenomenon of unemployment did not even have a formal name. dealing with joblessness when it occurred was generally considered a private affair to be dealt with by workers and their families (keyssar 1986). at the time of the birth of the asa, and, indeed, for a long time after, unemployment was considered an individual problem and not an issue of public policy. it was not until the economic panic of 1873 and the dislocation of employment that accompanied it that much attention began to be focused on measuring the phenomenon. thus unemployment grew to be a public concern long after it had affected working class lives and without the benefit of a statistical series. statistics in the field developed very slowly, in part because of the lack of consensus over the meaning of the concept (keyssar 1986). during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a few states attempted to define and measure unemployment, and some of the censuses of the period included questions on the subject. but the concepts were vague, no detailed or uniform criteria were used, and respondents often provided questionable information. in fact, the 1880 census data on unemployment were judged too erratic and incomplete even for tabulation. in almost all of these early attempts, the count was based on the labor market concept of the ""gainful worker."" all persons with an occupation at which they usually worked were asked whether they had periods without work during the preceding year. unemployment was defined as the number of gainful workers who were without jobs. a gainful worker was a person with an occupation who usually worked; the notion was that some of them were forced into idleness through no fault of their own. numerous attempts were made during the latter part of the nineteenth century, but no sustained federal effort at measurement came into being. indeed, the country's interest in unemployment tended to vary with the business cycle. despite the problems that involuntary idleness brought to workers, public officials paid little if any sustained attention to unemployment. brief bursts of public activity occurred during a depression or panic, but public attention to the problem waned as soon as the economy began to improve. the government programs that had been started to bring relief were quickly ended, and the investigations begun during the downturn were not completed until the recovery had set in. as a result, they were usually ignored (keyssar 1986, p. 250). it was not until the early decades of the twentieth century, when the chronic nature of unemployment and the recurrence of economic recession were recognized as matters for public attention, that the federal government took some steps to understand the issue. in 1921, president harding called a conference to consider the problems of joblessness. but few felt that the federal government should take action to alleviate the social distress caused by unemployment, and most officials believed that the task of data collection and analysis of unemployment was not properly a governmental function (de neufville 1975). president harding's conference was not even able to agree on the number who were unemployed. in fact, in what has been described as ""one of the lowest points in the history of social measurement, the conference voted on the number to announce as unemployed, choosing a suitably high range of figures to attract the nation's attention"" (de neufville 1975, p. 72). the conference announced to the country that the number of unemployed was somewhere between 2.5 and 5.5 million people (de neufville 1975; goldberg and moye 1985). a more precise estimate would not be generated until economic conditions got very much worse and a relevant concept of unemployment was developed. one result of the 1921conference, however, was the involvement of the statistical association in studying some of these issues in measurement, especially on the employment side (goldberg and moye 1985). the advent of the great depression in the early 1930s brought the matter to a head. shortly after the 1929stock 3 market crash, unemployment became a major issue of national concern. in 1930, some estimated that 3 to 4 million workers were without jobs. three years later, by 1933, somewhere between 13.6 and 16 million people were thought to be unemployed [see p. 6 in the chapter by paul webbink in shannon (1960)]. it is hard to realize that accurate survey based unemployment statistics were not available during the great depression. but even without statistical estimates, the hardship suffered by such massive unemployment caused the country to accept the need for government action. legislative initiatives under president roosevelt designed to deal with joblessness were put in place. this recognition of the need for government action also led to the belief that accurate data were needed. statisticians were put to work at the works progress administration to design a labor force survey to measure unemployment in a structured and systematic way. a new concept of unemployment was developed, based on an individual's activity all those without work who were available and looked for work. the current population survey, the scientific household survey that evolved from the work of these statisticians, became one of the federal government's most important economic indicators. the survey has made it possible for the federal government, each month, to monitor the success or failure of its policies to fight unemployment and its social problems. the development of unemployment statistics has certainly not solved the problem of unemployment, but it has contributed mightily to the government's ability to contain the spread of the problems caused by joblessness. consumer prices the third data series consumer prices has had quite a different history of interaction with public policy. of course, the people of this country have always been interested in the prices they pay. indeed, one of the first requests of a statistical agency made by the congress was for carroll wright's bureau to collect prices that could be used to compare prices in the united states with those in other countries. but in those early times, there was no perceived need for development of an overall inflation measure like the consumer price index (cpi). food prices were collected as early as 1892, and in 1903 a survey of retail prices and expenditures of working class families was carried out in principal cities in 33 states. we knew before the turn of the century, for example, that the average family spent 42.5% of its total consumption on food, about 21 times the proportion spent now. by 1912, regular publication of weighted retail food prices began. these price data were used to meet a perceived need. the people of the country wanted to find out how far a worker's wages would go in providing the commodities thought to be needed for an adequate living. people in those days were not interested in evaluating macroeconomic policy, measuring overall inflation levels, or indexing payments. 4 little more was accomplished in moving toward a full index of consumer prices until the united states entered world war i and the demand for more adequate statistics increased (goldberg and moye 1985). public policy now demanded action. during the war the cost of living rose, and the government did not know how to adjust wages to keep up with living costs. the country had no consumer price index, and there was general agreement that food prices could not be considered a reliable barometer for the prices of all commodities purchased. the issue arose first at the shipyards, since the shipbuilding labor adjustment board was required to adjust wages for the rising cost of living. the president gave the bureau of labor statistics $50,000 (and later added another $25,000) to conduct surveys in 18 shipbuilding centers. interest in indexation of wages increased, and in 1918 a comprehensive national consumer expenditure survey was undertaken. in releasing the data, commissioner of labor statistics royal meeker pointed out that there was no single standard of living in the country; rather, he said, there were many different standards depending on income and family size. the cpi represented the market basket of goods and services purchased by the average consumer. at the time, the new york times found the bureau report ""generally illuminating"" but commented that the bureau had a tendency to raise an ideal standard that could not be achieved by anyone. nevertheless, beginning in 1919, the consumer price index became a recurring government statistical program. thus the nation's consumer price index, currently one of the most widely used of all of our economic indicators, was created because of a single public policy requirement the escalation of wage payments. it was not, as in the case of the unemployment survey in the new deal days, that the government needed a statistical series to provide facts for use in legislative development or to monitor government programs; rather, the need was for an index to be used for indexing wage payments. the importance of the cpi increased markedly when, in 1948, the general motors united auto workers agreement included a cpi indexation clause. other labor management agreements followed. in the next 25 years, the trend toward use of the cpi to index payments crescendoed. indexation went far beyond collective bargaining agreements. from social security and private pensions to food stamps and other federal government entitlement programs, and most recently, even in the calculation of the income tax payments of citizens, the cpi has become a prominent player. in fact, it is estimated that a 1% change in the cpi can have about a $4.6 billion effect on the federal fiscal accounts. indeed, half the population lives in households where someone has income affected by the cpi. the underlying reason for the massive movement toward indexation in this country, of course, has been the concern about inflation. in the early 1970s, president nixon instituted a price freeze with the intent to hold the line against rising prices. with the middle eastern oil embargo in the mid 1970s and the large increases in food prices toward the end of that decade, the consumer price index hit double digit range and became one of the most closely watched of all the economic indicators. in many ways, the cpi, as an instrument of indexation, almost had the effect of an engine pushing inflation steadily higher. as wages rose, upward pressure on prices resulted in a higher cpi, and then the higher cpi pushed wages up still further. it took the sharp and steep recession of 1981 1982 to dampen inflationary expectations sufficiently to bring the cpi increase to a more moderate level. nevertheless, the quickening in the rate of increase in the cpi over the last year or so has brought with it both renewed interest in indexation of payments and increased attention to the cpi by policymakers trying to maintain the health of the economy. thus the statistical measure originally designed to index wages is now used as a major tool of macroeconomic policy determination in addition to being used to index all sorts of payments and contracts. conclusion these three examples demonstrate, i believe, a variety of different ways in which statistics have interacted with public policy. the development of data series has sometimes been the result of public concern over an issue, sometimes reflected the effect of new attitudes about government policy responsibilities, and sometimes been needed for policy implementation. over the last two decades, however, the situation has changed markedly. more and more, statistics have become an integral part of public policy. data series are used to index entitlement programs, to allocate federal funds to states and local areas, and to trigger programs on or off. statistical series are used for macroeconomic decision making and for microeconomic programs. they are used by the people of this country to evaluate the effectiveness of their government. we have indeed become a country that is run by the numbers. what does all of this mean for the federal statistical agencies that produce these data? i believe that we can draw some principles from this review. 1. statistical agencies cannot operate from ivory towers and expect the information they produce to be relevant to current issues. those who produce data must also analyze them and maintain a dialogue with users. this interaction enhances the effective use of data to understand emerging trends and enables statistical agencies to keep their data series relevant. 2. change is a necessary part of a good statistical system, and we should not fear it. just as there is no absolute certainty in statistical estimation, there is no absolute perfection in statistical methodology. we should always be searching for improvements, and we should not be afraid to adopt them. 3. research on the concepts to be measured and on survey design, analysis, and error measurement must be ongoing. it is impossible to maintain a data system of high quality without an adequate investment in survey research. 4. we must ensure the objectivity as well as the accuracy of our data. statistics must also be relevant to the needs of society, and they must be issued in a manner that keeps them free of political manipulation. carroll wright said it well: ""judicious investigation of fact and the fearless publication of the results thereof"" (goldberg and moye 1985). 5. we must place at the heads of each of the country's major statistical agencies a person with professional qualifications and unquestioned integrity. agency heads must be strongly committed to independence from political influence and have the courage to speak out when that independence is threatened. within each statistical agency, a climate where professionals can argue differing positions, even unpopular ones, must be established. 6. statistical agencies must take full responsibility for methodological decisions, even when those decisions produce results that may be politically unpopular. statistical methods are not a fit subject for legislative determination. statistical data are inextricably intertwined with public policy. we have come a long way in the last 150 years. but the discipline that we represent is so important to society that much more needs to be done. let us join together to strengthen scientific inquiry through the use of statistical techniques and work to provide the data re 5 quired for the formulation, evaluation, and implementation of public policy.

Barabba","1970-1999","i'm sure most of you are familiar with the phrase, ""through a glass darkly."" the reason i'm sure it's familiar is that, after a fairly thorough computer search, i found that the phrase, along with being found in i corinthians 13, also appears in the title of some 40 books and 20 parts of books. in addition, it is either the title or is mentioned in 7 poems, 1 film, 3 musical scores, 15 theses, 7 plays, and 1 opera. now, given its wide use, i've chosen to modify the phrase to ""through a glass less darkly"" so that this discussion would not be lost in a crowd of dark glasses. i also found it interesting to see the many ways in which the phrase is interpreted and used. the first of the two most prominent meanings centered around gloomy or dire predictions, and the second, the difficulty in finding unambiguous empirical truth and the need to deal with uncertainty. it is this second interpretation of ""through a glass darkly"" the difficulty in finding unambiguous empirical truth and the need to deal with uncertainty that i want to discuss with you. but to get to that discussion, i have to first deal with some gloomy or dire predictions. our working environment will become more difficult it is my belief that if our profession is to survive and flourish we must learn to do so in a future (some might say current) environment where the need for many of our services will increase, while, at the same time, the available funding resources to provide those services will become scarcer. the story is told of a little girl who, while sleeping in her room, was awakened by the chimes of a grandfather clock. she counted to herself. nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and then the clock struck, at least in her mind, for the thirteenth time. startled by a thirteenth chime, the girl ran to her parents' room and exclaimed, ""mommy, daddy, it's later than it's ever been!"" and the same is true for all of us involved in statistics. though we have moved in the right direction, the pace of change has been too slow. relative to our continued growth, if not our survival, it's later than it's ever been! indeed, we should be asking, ""having celebrated our 150th year in grand style, what will we be able to say during our 200th year?"" i'm sure we could argue about the levels or the shifts in types of demand for our services. i'm also sure we could argue about the amount and types of available resources. i believe, however, that there is little argument that as the need for our capabilities is becoming more intense, the funding resources available to meet this need are not increasing at the same rate. indeed, we might even claim that other resources, particularly access to less costly, yet more useful, computation power and productivity increases, have partially offset the relative decrease in funding. it is my judgment that, if we are to ensure continued societal support, we as a profession of statisticians, whether we work with statistics as an analytical activity or with the data of statistics, must make ourselves more clearly understood and valued by those who use our work. without this understanding and appreciation, statistics will not be fully used; they will be put on the shelf; and statistically derived data and thinking will be perceived as a less valuable addition to the decision process. today, many decision makers have already decided there are too many facts available which lead to ""paralysis by analysis"" and, therefore, they depreciate further collections. and in many of their decisions, they are correct. i strongly believe that if we continue on our current course, statistically based information will, at best, be used only to confirm earlier predispositions, and at worst, be done away with in times of scarce resources. that is the dire or gloomy meaning of ""through a glass darkly."" now let me, through the second meaning, that is, the search for truth in an uncertain world. today, society is still faced with many ills, lots of data, and is still in need of that knowledge loom. in this presentation i will try to provide an initial blueprint from which we can begin building such a loom a knowledge loom that will lead to wiser decisions through the more effective use of the information we develop using statistical practices. increasing value data context inference less is more information figure 1. haeckel's hierarchy modified. decreasing volume the first step in drawing our blueprint is to understand where and how information fits into the process that leads to decision making. much of the information discussed in this section is drawn from a recent book of ibm, has developed a model which not only provides improved understanding but addresses the problem of past strategies which have focused on increasing the amount of analysis of information, which in the opinion of many, has compounded the problem. in effect, haeckel points out that more is not better; it only makes the problem worse. figure 1 is a modification of haeckel's conception of an information hierarchy. the basic objective illustrated in figure 1 is to achieve more with less. we start with many codified observations which we describe as data. by putting these data in context (a decision framework), we develop information. by applying inference (judgment) to contextual information we generate intelligence. as we gain certitude (greater certainty and acceptability) it leads to knowledge. and finally, by applying synthesis, holistically bringing together knowledge parts, we create wisdom. the underlying belief of this model is that we can, simultaneously, decrease the volume of data while increasing its value to the user. a limitation of haeckel's hierarchy is that it does not directly address the issues related to the differences between information users and information providers. this re sion an opportunity with potentially great rewards. the opportunity is to help decision makers use information to move beyond the realm of ""just seeing the facts that fit"" to a higher standard of improved decision quality that leads to wiser decisions. i suggest that it is the role of statisticians to bring relevant information, through a glass less darkly, to the complex and messy public and private policy decision world of our society. additionally, if we find that the processes to accomplish this role are not sufficient, then we must actively participate in their development. i also believe that the quality of thinking about an issue prior to the collection of data is the major determinant to the quality of thinking after the data have been collected. based on my experience, this approach is one that is in the best interests of both the users and the providers of statistics for it increases the chances of doing the right thing and doing it right. thus, it enhances the value of statistically derived information for society and, therefore, increases the appreciation of statistics. when i refer to the providers of information i include not only those who collect data, but also those who analyze, process, or otherwise develop data for use by another party. one of the fundamental changes we need to achieve is the development of processes that minimize the dysfunctional aspects of the fundamental differences between the methods and personalities of those who collect information (using statistical procedures), and of those who use information. one of these fundamental differences is that the technologies for data acquisition and processing are oriented toward ""people proofing."" that is, they are oriented toward reducing or at least isolating and defining personal or procedural bias by establishing ""objective"" guidelines for experimental design, sampling procedures, the construction and administration of questionnaires, reliance on formal analytical procedures, and so on (deming 1960, chs. 1,4, and 5). in contrast, the process of using information is very much a judgmental matter where choices between personal values cannot be avoided (mitroff 1974, ch. 7). moreover, it is not desirable to depersonalize information use even if we could, since the effective use of research relies heavily on the value laden nonresearch frames of reference that decision makers bring to a problem. as we move from the arena of data collection, processing, and analysis to that of information use, we move from a systematic approach to one dominated by art or craft and justifiably motivated by purposes other than production of scientific information. thus, technologies for improving research use must be ""peopleinvolving."" although the domain of the decision maker may be less systematic than that of the information provider, both groups require ""operational definitions"" to ensure clear understanding of what they are collecting, analyzing, and deciding. about fifty years ago, edna st. vincent millay (1941, p. 140) wrote a poem that quite poignantly pointed out that although there were many ills facing society, there existed no ""loom"" to weave the ""meteoric shower of facts .. [that] lie unquestioned, uncombined"" into a usable fabric of wisdom. requires that we further modify the hierarchy to make clear that there is an information using domain that is different from the information producing domain. the issue is further complicated by the integrated sets of assumptions, truth tests, expectations, and decision rules that both information users and providers possess. these factors make up people's personal viewing lenses which are deeply rooted in their existing experiences and usually lead them to find what they are looking for, sometimes quite independent of reality (or truth). this has been referred to as the ""law of the lens"" (zaltman 1982). the ""law of the lens"" manifests itself in many ways. in business, for example, new product management teams, when assessing the feasibility of introducing new products, tend to favor their introduction with a frequency that is unwarranted by subsequent commercial performance. analysis of many new product failures points to a tendency to both design research, and interpret research results, in a way that does not allow equal opportunity for evidence to arise that runs counter to a new product launch decision. based on my experience in government, i could say the same of agency heads attempting to support their programs in either office of management and budget analysis or congressional budget committees. the needs to adjust for the law of the lens and see through the glass less darkly requires that we acknowledge that the domains of the information providers and users be integrated and not separated. this is in spite of the reality that these domains are very different and that, because of the ""law of the lens,"" there are considerable forces which encourage the differences. policy (wise decisions) 3 information hierarchy figure 2 provides a perspective of the relationship between the data (0), information, and intelligence domain of information providers relative to the knowledge and policy (or decision) domain of decision makers. the illustration attempts to reflect how reality is assessed by collecting and classifying data, having portions of that data analyzed in such a manner as to provide information (greater insight), portions of which are then developed into intelligence reports which are relevant and of interest to potential users. this is important because, as c. west churchman (1971, p. 10) has noted, "". knowledge resides in the user and not in the collection. it's how the user reacts to the collection of information that matters."" churchman's observation points out that as we move from intelligence to knowledge, we move from the domain of the provider to the domain of the user. this points to the importance of understanding the knowledge and policy (or decision) domain of information users. figure 2 also illustrates the imposition of the ""law of the lens"" on the information hierarchy where the two domains interact. the figure recognizes that decision makers have their own perception of reality which has a direct impact on the manner in which they see and accept or reject intelligence reports. because of their view of the world and their experiences, decision makers' perceptions of reality are usually somewhat different, not necessarily less accurate, than the reality of the marketplace as perceived by those involved in its measurement. though the lens, in this illustration, appears to have a one way effect, it is, in real domain of information user domain of information provider. a two way lens which can lead to differences of interpretation between what users state are their information needs and what the providers believe is actually being asked. the point is that it is likely that the two groups will differ, not that either may be right or wrong. indeed, for today's complex issues, for which there are multiple ""right"" answers, an understanding of why they differ (their underlying assumptions and beliefs) is as important as the ""right"" answer. although figure 2 illustrates the imposition of the ""law of the lens"" between only the domains of the information provider and the information user, the manifestations of the ""law of the lens"" exist between each of the other elements of the information hierarchy as well, in spite of our heroic efforts to people proof our statistical practices. indeed, some have criticized our emphasis on the value of ""people proofing"" statistical procedures because it conjures up a ""myth of objectivity"" which implies a level of precision which we know is not achievable. for example, how often are the implications of the assumptions which underlie decisions relative to the choice of statistical test, removing outliers, or selecting the level of significance operationally defined, much less even fully discussed, in the presentation of the results of our efforts. the statistician and the law of the lens recently, two of my colleagues at general motors and i participated in a conference on statistics applied to marketing management held at the university of michigan. given the objective of the conference, our presentation focused on how we work at identifying problems and then, because of resource limitations, use ""off the shelf"" statistical tools to find fast and easy to use answers for our internal gm clients. during the question and answer period, we were asked: given that you want the universities to train statisticians to be able to pull the right statistical tools off the shelf and make them work for the client, you are looking for new statisticians who are capable of creating successful relationships with clients, of engaging in conversation and staying with it through all the uncertainties and discomfort that show up in those conversations. you want statisticians who believe that the clients are not dumb because they don't know exactly what they are looking for. he then got to the heart of the ""people involving"" skills issue by asking, ""... can academia train students to that level of relationship skills, particularly since a lot of students may get into statistics so that they can deal with numbers and not have to deal with people?"" he went further, asking that if schools are going to provide students with the abilities that we at general motors were looking for, would those who teach statistics need to seek help to train their students in this broader set of skills? without saying so, the questioner was asking not only whether instructors of communications skills should be used in helping the students, but also if teachers of statistics need to learn how to convey people involving skills as well as teaching the people proofing skills that they already know so well? the answer is, unquestionably yes! the reason people involving skills are so important is that there are few things more subjective than a number. and nothing surfaces that subjectivity like putting the number to use. that's a problem for statisticians who choose to retreat to the comfort of rigorous procedures which imply objectivity, rather than seeking heroic encounters with those who use our products and services. this retreat to rigorous procedures can lead to what ian mitroff has identified as type iii errors. that is, ""the probability of precisely solving the wrong problem, when you should have been working on the right problem."" consider how often statisticians respond to questions concerning a particular estimate by retreating to a textbook definition of the statistical techniques that were used, rather than explaining what the limitations of the application of that technique means to the user. this type of response is somewhat analogous to a situation where a person observing an abstract painting asks his colleague to describe what the painting means, only to have the colleague open a dictionary and say, ""this represents a school of painting that flourished after world war ii until the early 1960's characterized by the exclusion of representational content."" if we are to be valued by the customers of our products or services we must learn to respond directly to their questions dealing with subjective issues and not retreat to the comfortable rigor implied by the manner in which we describe our statistical procedures. in a paper delivered in june to the workshop on statistical education, brian joiner (1990) referred directly to this illusion of knowledge by stating: this illusion perpetuates our practice of teaching students things they don't want to know, things that will mislead them once they leave school. this illusion prevents us from making great discoveries about how to teach statistics that help us understand the causes of today's problems and make useful changes for the future. if we statisticians are to make worthwhile contributions to reinvigorating our businesses and society, we must break through this illusion of knowledge. making the glass less dark up to this point, i have attempted to demonstrate to you why information producers view a situation through one lens, while information users view it through another. that's the problem. the opportunity is to alter the prescriptions for each of their viewing lenses to correct the following myopic views. providers of knowledge currently look through their lenses and say: you see, i'm being helpful to decision makers because i'm providing all this meaningful information. however, it is really frustrating when the decision makers don't even know what information they really want. sometimes they respond to my question of ""what do you need?"" with ""what do you have?"" also, they do not take the time to understand exactly how i've collected and analyzed the information they did want collected. usually all i ever hear is, •... what's the bottom line?"" this position is reasonable, of course, when the viewer's lens reveals a relatively simple and straightforward problem for which there are available criteria which allow the development of an optimal or ""clean"" answer. but, bonnen (1989) reminds us that in today's and tomorrow's environment, how often do we face simple and straightforward problems? thus, every policy decision involves values and prescriptions. there is no such thing as a value free decision, despite some silly statements by a few economists and other social scientists that draw contempt from policy makers and politicians. every policy decision inevitably involves problem solving in which there is a compromise of goals and values in a learning process that is iterative and interactive. this is a process in which organized interests are in conflict and which is influenced by existing political institutions, the stakeholding actors, the prior decisions and political commitments that the responsible decision maker(s) have already made all of which condition what is possible at any point in time. (p. 46) and if you doubt bonnen's observations, perhaps you should have a discussion with our statistical colleagues who have been appointed to the panel to review the decision on the adjustment of the 1990 census. the decision makers currently look through their lenses and say: don't you see that you make things more complicated than they need to be. based on my experience and seasoned judgment, i understand the situation, and i'm willing to take the responsibility and make the decision. all these studies you want to do and the precision you're striving for just add complexity to the situation. you're causing paralysis by analysis. all this research isn't worth the time or cost because it slows down the decision making process. you raise everybody's expectations about reducing uncertainty and then you simply add to the confusion because you bring in conflicting and surprising findings. no wonder we can't make timely and consistent decisions around here. as might be expected, these different views are likely to create different behaviors. for example, some statisticians may respond to ambiguous data by presenting information users or decision makers with more data and more analyses. the decision maker, on the other hand, may respond by demanding less information that has greater value. by ""greater value,"" decision makers usually mean information that is (a) clearly placed in a decision context, (b) in a form that facilitates their making better judgments, and (c) easily synthesized with their other knowledge an approach more akin to haeckel's hierarchy presented earlier. the message is clear, the successful statisticians of the future must not only view their roles as bringing information to bear, which reduces uncertainty relative to a particular decision at hand, but to also be sensitive to the manner in which they surface new areas of uncertainty which could materially affect the outcome of a particular decision. it is also important to recognize that if there is more than one category of user, there is a good chance they each have their own lens. in effect, multiple lenses are used for evaluating and responding to the same situation. if you have doubts about the level of complexity when dealing with multiple lenses, imagine yourself as the director of the census bureau deciding how to present the results of a comparison between the findings of the 1990 post enumeration evaluation survey and the results of the 1990 census enumeration to a meeting comprised of the following interested parties: atlanta mayor maynard jackson, john tukey, bill kruskal, the oversight committee chairmen of the house and the senate, a federal district court judge as well as the leadership of the mexican legal defense fund, the naacp, the republican and democratic parties, the population association, the economic association, the marketing association, and the statistical association. the relevant point for us is to make sure that we understand as thoroughly as possible the actual information needs and perspectives of our users and that the information we 5 generate is as close to those requirements as is feasible in both substance and form. how can we do that? i believe the answer is found somewhere between the positions that barbara bailar and janet norwood suggested to us in their presidential addresses: barbara bailar (1988) said, ""it is not enough for statisticians to view themselves as problem solvers; they must sit at the table when policy determinations are being made. public policy is too important to be left to politicians. "" and in her address, janet norwood (1990) said, ""statistical agencies cannot operate from ivory towers and expect the information they produce to be relevant to current issues. those who produce data must also analyze them and maintain a dialogue with users. this interaction enhances the effective use of data to understand emerging trends and enables statistical agencies to keep their data series relevant. "" in their comments, though they differ in their intensity, my predecessors have made it clear that we statisticians can provide useful information only if we take the time to improve the interface between those who have the facts, and those who need them. it's the difference in the level of involvement, however, that both barbara and janet identified a significant barrier that is often raised when we talk about getting the providers and the users closer together. most information providers see the importance of the linkage with the information users. but many prefer armslength transactions rather than close encounters. the main worry is the potential for manipulation of information production and dissemination, and there is historical precedent to support their concern. however, as my friend and colleague at the bureau of the census, ted clemence, once suggested, somewhat wryly, the only way for the federal statistician to function wholly apart from the political process is to be irrelevant and there is some historical precedent for that, too! of course, some statisticians are troubled by becoming too involved with the users of their efforts because of the possibility of being affected by the user's personal value system and desire for positive answers to preconceived positions. in my view, however, if the only way we can earn our way to the decision making table is by joining in the meal, then let's get some agreement on the protocol, and let the dinner begin! making a quality decision let me offer a protocol which allows providers of information to meaningfully contribute to quality decisions. however, before we get to the actual protocol we have to define what we mean by quality decisions. decisions can be generally defined as irrevocable allocations of resources, including capital and operating budgets, personnel, time, et cetera. the critical element is the tight connection between the decision and the resource allocation. two very practical implications emerge from this definition. first, by thinking of decisions in terms of resource allocations, the implementation of the decision is facilitated and accountabilities are established. second, managers are 6 forced to resolve conflicts regarding allocation of resources up front in order to ensure successful implementation. however, of relevance to our protocol is the fact that no matter how many resources decision makers control, they have little control over or knowledge about the direction of other critical factors, such as competitive action, government regulation or legislation, international developments, and future customer or voter preferences. yet, any of these factors can have considerable influence on the ultimate result of any decision. therefore, identifying these uncertainties is critical because they contribute to the overall risk associated with each possible decision. the protocol must also comprehend the reality that the decision alternatives with the highest expected return often have the greatest associated risk. this requires the identification of the critical uncertainties associated with any alternative and the assessment of their relative contribution to overall risk. understanding decision quality is important to statisticians, because a critical element of decision quality is information quality; not only facts and numbers, but also a clear statement of the uncertainty about those facts and numbers and the assumptions that underlie them. providing accurate, relevant, timely, and easy to use information to the decision process is where our profession has made some of its major contributions. however, if we are to be as valuable in the future as we have been in the past, we will have to find ways to assist the decision maker in assessing the risk associated with the critical factors for which he has no information at all. i find it interesting that our colleagues who provide statistical consulting services to industry relative to the management of product quality have been successful in convincing management that quality cannot be an afterthought that is ""inspected in"" at the end of the production line; it must be an intrinsic part of the entire product development and production process, including how we manage human resources. it is unfortunate that the rest of us have not applied these same insightswhen it comes to making a decision. in fact, i would venture a qualified assessment that many of us are unaware of the process we use when making decisions. this is in large part because for something so personal as our own thought process, it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish the process of making a decision from the substance of it. that does not mean we do not have names for the tools and techniques that we apply. some of us might say, ""i weigh the facts,"" ""i balance cost and benefits,"" ""i look at the down side,"" or ""i list strengths and weaknesses."" i would, however, venture to say that if pressed to identify the steps that we actually go through to make sure of the quality of our decisions, few would be able to articulate the process. a process that i have come to appreciate underlies the manner in which we have been using decision and risk analysis to assist us in ensuring quality decisions at general motors. one of the reasons i like the process is that it approaches decision quality like some of our statistical colleagues have approached product quality. the decision and risk analysis process the decision and risk analysis process (figure 3) is essentially a structured dialogue between a decision maker review board and a cross function analytical study team (howard 1983). in the spirit of our definition of a quality decision, the review board consists of those who are responsible for resource allocation. often these decision makers will be from different business units or different functional areas across which decision complementarity is important and difficult. during the time the team is assembled to work on a specific assignment they will (a) approve the framing of the problem, (b) select alternatives for analysis, (c) identify (create if necessary) the best potential alternative, and (d) make and communicate the required decisions. problem decision maker review board (a) (b) (c) (d) approve select identify make decision and framing alternatives for potential ""besr' communicate analysis alternative to organization '""'""""' (3) (4) (1) (2) analyze detailed analysis initial identify selected op'besr' framing alternatives alternatives alternative cross function analytical study team decision figure 3. decision and risk analysis process. baraboo: through a glass less darkly the cross function analytical study team brings highquality information, analytic tools which assist in the proper treatment of uncertainties, and a logically consistent analytical framework. during the time they serve on the team, they (1) provide the initial framing definition, (2) identify alternative solutions, (3) analyze selected alternatives, and (4) conduct complete analysis of the best alternative. a highly interactive dialogue takes place between these two groups, the decision maker review board and the crossfunctional analytical study team. the first interaction focuses on the proper framing of the problem [activities 1 and a]. by framing we mean identification and organization of all critical issues that must be comprehended as a part of the decision process. these issues include decisions, uncertainties, values, objectives, and facts. framing is important because, unfortunately, we often are willing to talk about the collection of information before determining what the objective actually is. by framing the problem with the review board we address mitroff's errors of the third kindprecisely solving the wrong problem mentioned earlier. it is my observation, that all too often, suboptimal decisions are made because all of the variables of the problem were not considered at the beginning. furthermore, there is a tendency for analysts to ""run for their most comfortable database or modeling tools,"" often because that is the data base or tool that ""we know best."" by framing the problem at the beginning of the decision process, we are more likely to consider all areas of uncertainty and to concentrate on those factors which matter most, not just those factors for which we believe we have the greatest understanding. an example that has been pointed out to me is the desire to monitor the high school dropout rate. there are several existing large surveys which could easily and quite precisely measure the number of dropouts. but what would a change in that rate mean? is the number of dropouts affected by the ease to which well paying jobs are available? 7 or, is it by a change in academic standards adopted by school systems. information providers can play an important part in this dialogue by probing this very important question of meaning, as well as ensuring that operational definitions precede attempts at quantification (deming 1986, p. 278). a second dialogue determines which alternative strategies should be considered and evaluated [activities 2 and b]. as an example, one alternative strategy might consist mostly of resource allocations that are responsive to the ""voice of the market,"" a second to the ""voice of the company."" other strategies may strike a balance between the two voices, but employ different approaches to achieving that balance. our experience to date identifies this dialogue as a key stage for potential creative interaction between the worlds of the user and provider. the third dialogue focuses on the insight derived from the analysis relative to the sources of value found in each alternative [activities 3 and b]. this activity is important because with most complex problems, the ""best"" strategy is usually not identified at the outset of the problem. rather, it is developed as a composite of alternative strategies based on the insight gained during the analysis. a final dialogue [activities 4 and d] includes a thorough evaluation of the best strategy and an agreement among members of the review board that the decision has been made. the dialogue also includes the development of a plan to communicate the decision to the rest of the organization and to then implement the decision. obviously, engaging in this structural dialogue takes management's time, and that time is limited. senior managers must, therefore, choose those decisions for which they will take active responsibility. other decisions for which they do not have enough time must be delegated to other managers who follow the same process model. in this way, a management team committed to total quality in all they do accepts the time commitment required for decision qual decision maker review board not as a constraint which requires them to make ""judgment calls,"" but as a criterion for delegation of decisions to others who do have the time. in order to support this decision making, those providing the information, including statisticians, must notify senior managers that the cost of providing good information may well be high, in terms of the time, the quality of people, and other resources that may be necessary. the knowledge loom at the outset i indicated i would try to provide an initial blueprint of a knowledge loom and demonstrate how that loom will help us make more effective use of statistically derived data. with some minor alterations to figure 3 we can provide a vision of the blueprint. the decision and risk analysis process and the knowledge loom the initial blueprint of the knowledge loom is shown in figure 4. let us define a loom as a frame for weaving horizontal and vertical elements in place. these elements are the wavy lines in the figure. now consider each of the steps taken by the decision maker review board as being connected by a thread. similarly, the steps taken by the crossfunction analytical study team are also connected by a thread. also consider, that though complementary, the threads are different in their textures, colors, and origins. finally, consider the decision and risk analysis process as another thread which vertically binds the two horizontal threads to help us weave a tapestry of wise decisions that can be implemented successfully. summary and conclusion the future offers us an opportunity to help decision makers use information to move beyond the realm of ""just seeing the facts that fit"" to a higher standard of improved decision quality which leads to wiser decisions that can be implemented successfully. this opportunity is embodied in a blueprint for a knowledge loom. the knowledge loom is predicated on a series of actions, interactions, and beliefs that will cause better decisions to be made. the first step in drawing the blueprint is to understand where and how information fits into the process of decision making. as large quantities of data are collected and distilled, they go through processes that change them into information, intelligence, knowledge, and finally, wisdom. an underlying premise of this process is that as information is refined it becomes more valuable and in the end, from the perspective of the decision maker, it can be said that less is more. throughout the entire process of the refinement of the information provided to decision makers, each person dealing with the data views them from his or her own perspective. this phenomenon is referred to as the ""law of the lens."" it adds a level of complication to the process of transferring information and, therefore, needs to be explicitly recognized in that process. a framework that we use at general motors to enhance the decision process is that of decision and risk analysis. through this process, the different functions, perceptions, and skills of information users and providers are acknowledged and structured to improve the decision process. the problem is identified, altematives are analyzed, and the best alternative is selected, all with concurrence of the decision makers and the information providers. throughout the process, communication among the different groups of people is ensured by the format of the process. it allows the threads of the different groups to be woven together. this decision and risk analysis process with the accompanying flow of information is the

""that's what is lacking in this whole business statistics,"" he says. because the pons/fleischmann effect, if it exists, is so hard to reproduce, researchers have generally spent most of their time and money just trying to get cells that work. they generally have not set up control cells the article goes on to explain how wolf's group and another group have done experiments "". with a proper blank control cells with regular water in place of heavy water so that no fusion is possible,"" as a check on the palladium possibly being contaminated with tritium. it's clear that in this instance producing uncontaminated data is far from a routine process. in many other cases and fields producing good data is not usually a routine, objective, reproducible process. thus, always, it is wise to heed the advice of alan enthoven, a former undersecretary of defense, who strongly advised us in a chicago workshop meeting to get the facts! he made his point vividly by pointing out that in the 1950s it was estimated and believed that the russians had twelve million military personnel in the field. during these cold war years, our secretary of state threatened to drop the bomb on the russians while the europeans were singing better red than dead. at the end of the decade, someone asked how much of russian gnp it would take to support their twelve million military personnel. after a little arithmetic and investigation, he debunked the twelve million figure by pointing out that many of the russian divisions were reserve divisions and their division size was about seventy five hundred rather than eleven thousand, as had been assumed. with these and other corrections, the estimated number was brought down to three to four million, however not before almost a decade of a cold war that could have turned into a hot, nuclear war at any time. thus, then as now, the advice get the facts has great relevance for statistics, science and policy, and, fortunately, many statisticians are in the forefront in producing reliable facts. perhaps this cold war episode points to a need for a new asa section which would develop methods for measuring and monitoring the accuracy of news reported in the media. certainly schools of journalism need good statistics courses. in this connection, a 1989 cartoon in pravda showed the soviet public roaring in laughter on viewing the official soviet economic statistics indicating strong growth and little inflation. also, according to chuck waite of our census bureau, when soviet government workers were told about u.s. procedures for releasing sensitive economic statistics, one of them asked, ""how can the president change a number if he doesn't like it?"" with our own official government statistics, it's hard to know what the u.s. saving rate is see, for example, judge (1989). based on department of commerce personal savings data, the saving rate is in the vicinity of 5%. on the other hand, individual savings as reported by the federal reserve board yields a much higher savings rate, in the vicinity of 8 to 9%. with other reasonable adjustments, some estimate the savings rate to be in the vicinity of 15%. this is but one example of many others pointed out by michael boskin and donald ratajczak, our excellent 1991 b&e section forecast luncheon speaker, of weak spots in our national data base that make analysis, forecasting and policy making extremely difficult. even though our data are much, much better than the soviets' data, we must work hard to improve them. as another example illustrating the importance of getting the facts, some years ago an economist did a theoretical analysis of a famous marine conservation program, the international pacific halibut conservation program set up under a treaty between canada and the united states and studied for several years by james crutchfield and myself (1963). in his analysis, he assumed a constant equilibrium fish population and criticized the program for not charging fishermen a fee for fishing for halibut in the north pacific. while his theoretical argument is probably valid under some conditions, this bright analyst forgot to get the facts. the facts, carefully collected over the years by marine biologists and the statistician douglas chapman, clearly revealed that the halibut population was declining for many decades and not equal to a constant equilibrium value. here indeed is an example of what thomas huxley has called a tragedy of science, the destruction of a beautiful hypothesis or analysis by an ugly fact. i have become convinced over the years that we should work harder to produce more ugly facts. one way to do this is to push current theories, hypotheses, models, beliefs, et cetera in any area of science, to extremes, deduce their implications and predictions, and then do the dirty work by producing the ugly facts to show that they are outlandish. the coup de grace can be applied most effectively using statistical expertise and finesse. in addition to thinking of statistical and other procedures to produce ugly facts rather than just dull, run of the mill facts, note that the great mathematician hadamard (1945) surveyed his fellow mathematicians and found from their responses that recognition of unusual facts played a key role in producing major breakthroughs in mathematics. while hadamard's description of this process is fascinating, i shall just remark that recognition of a new, unusual fact prompts many minds to work to produce explanations of it, that is, new hypotheses and theories. there are many well known examples of this process in all fields of science. thus a statistical problem is how to design investigations to produce unusual facts rather than humdrum, old, dull facts. some years ago, i suggested a number of rather obvious ways to produce unusual facts, namely, study unusual historical periods, survey unusual groups, look for regularities 3 in data, collect data on incorrect predictions and forecasts of scientists and their models, study equations and properties of large scale econometric, global warming, macromolecular and other complicated models (almost every equation of such econometric models contains at least one unusual fact), and so on. having produced an unusual fact, a statistician may think the job is done. if so, a glowing opportunity is being missed, namely, the creation of an explanation or hypothesis to explain the unusual fact, which, if supported by much additional data, could lead to a nobel prize, if only there were a nobel prize in statistics. in my opinion, the nobel prize committee needs educating on the importance of statistics in science and policy making and how to distinguish between loose mathematicians and fine statisticians. speaking of nobel prizes, i must mention the great empirical economic statistical work of the nobel prize winner simon kuznets. he is credited with the basic research that led to our national income and product accounts, data which are invaluable to researchers, forecasters, and private and public policy makers. he and others recognized the importance of measurement and description in science and policy. thus, as a graduate student in economics i was shocked to learn that kuznets's, burns's, mitchell's, and others' work on measurement of key economic variables was damned as ""measurement without theory"" by a leading, theoretically oriented econometrician. later, i coined the phrase theory without measurement to denigrate the irrelevant work of some theorists and also to emphasize that in all fields both theorists and empirical workers have produced important research contributions. instead of knocking heads much of the time, it would be better for theorists and empirical workers to interact more fruitfully in statistics and other sciences. the usefulness of such interaction is evidenced by the research of nobel prize winners milton friedman, merton miller, theodore schultz, and george stigler, my colleagues in economics and business at the university of chicago. all of them have done outstanding work in establishing what are the facts in their fields, analyzing the facts using modem statistical methods and relating their results to economic theory and policy. their work was enriched by close contact with econometricians and statisticians in our business school and university departments of statistics and economics in research workshop meetings, private consultations, and chicago luncheon discussions. with a large statistics and econometrics group in our university, fruitful interactions between members of this group and applied empirical workers and subject matter theorists take place frequently and benefit all concerned. applied workers improve their analyses, theorists learn how to relate their theories to data, and exposure to new problems often causes statisticians and econometricians to produce new statistical and computational methods. further, fine work in the quality management and improvement area in our business school involving the statisticians george easton, edward george, william golomski, rob mcculloch, harry roberts, george tiao, ruey tsay, and others has benefited from interactions with our 4 school's management scientists, economists, behavioral scientists, and other specialists. in this area, the facts have been assembled and analyzed using modern time series and other techniques with important results that have, along with results of many other researchers, had a significant impact on u.s. industry. coupled with deming's, taguchi's, box's, and others' methods and philosophy, this work has resulted in a growing appreciation of statistics and statisticians. i believe that these examples of the key role of statistics and statisticians in university research are not specific to chicago and should be recognized generally by universities, especially those without departments of statistics. in this day and age, it's my view that a university without a department of statistics is like an automobile without a motor or a soldier without a rifle. to return to the facts, usual, unusual, ugly, et cetera that are inputs to science, what are some of the objectives of science? i have come to agree with karl pearson (1938) and harold jeffreys (1988) that a major objective of science is learning from our data and experience and another is solving practical problems. central in the learning process and in solving practical problems are the methods of statistics, which are at the heart of the unity of science. that is, similar statistical methods are not only used in many different fields of science but also use of good statistical methods for learning from data and experience is necessary for a field to be termed scientific. this central role of statistics in science involving data production, description, design of experiments and surveys, estimation, testing, prediction, risk analysis, and decision making has come to be widely appreciated and thus, in large part, the growth of statistics, econometrics, and all the other ""metrics"" fields in the decades of this century. when it is stated that learning from our data and experience is a fundamental objective of science, one may ask, ""how do you learn?"" some learn informally, while bayesians use bayes's theorem as a formal learning model. for years, many, including members of our nsf nber bayesian seminar group, have compared results of bayesian and non bayesian analyses of specific problems. i have concluded from this and other work that the bayesian learning model is effective for use in many, frequently encountered problems and yields rather good results. this is not to say that the bayesian model is perfect no model in science is perfect but just that it has been shown to be quite useful in analyzing facts with given models and in making decisions in many different fields of science. perhaps good's (1991) good bayes/non bayes compromise put forward for many years and reviewed in an invited paper presented at this meeting will be successful in uniting bayesians and non bayesians. for such an accomplishment, good deserves the nobel peace prize. at this point, i cannot resist saying a few words about use of balanced loss functions (blfs) which will, in my opinion, create more balance between bayesians and nonbayesians. consider the n means problem, yi = 8i + e., i = 1, 2, .. , n, where 8i is the mean of yi' or in vector journal of the statistical association notation, y = 8 + e. a blf for this problem is l(8, 0) = w(y o)'(y 0) + (1 w)(o 8)'(0 8), whereis some estimate of 8 and w is a given weight,=5 w =5 1. the first term of this blf reflects goodness of fit and the second, precision of estimation. given that a posterior density for 8 is available, it can be used to obtain posterior expected loss, eel(8, 0), which can be minimized with respect toto obtain the minimum expected loss (meld) estimate, 0* = wy + (1 w)8, where 8 is the posterior mean of 8. currently, many non bayesians use w = 1 while most bayesians use w = o. why not be balanced and use the meld estimate based on a reasonable value of w which balances goodness of fit and unbiasedness and precision of estimation? for posterior expected losses, risk functions and bayes risks of 0*, y and 8, see my recent paper (1991), which also considers estimation of regression coefficients. after facts or data are assembled and described, a fundamental problem is present. what model shall we utilize in analyzing the data? in this connection, i have become enamored with the precept kiss, keep it sophisticatedly simple, not as they say in industry, keep it simple stupid because some simple models are stupid. i can think of many sophisticatedly simple models in science that work well in explanation and prediction and have challenged many audiences to tell me about a single complicated model in any field of science that works well in explanation and prediction. as yet, i have not heard of any but have discovered a number of religious believers in mind boggling, complex models and methods. these people need saving! usually, given the theoretical and judgmental information that we have, an initial, tentative sophisticatedly simple model can be formulated and analyzed. when little information is available, the initial model or benchmark model might be a random walk model or some such simple model as suggested by harold jeffreys, milton friedman, and others. if there is a need to capture much detail, a model may have to be large but with care it can be sophisticatedly simple. many large econometric and other models on the scene involve hundreds of nonlinear stochastic difference equations. it's not clear whether these models have one or many solutions and the dynamic properties of these black box monstrosities are not well understood. years of effort and much money have been spent to build these edsels and more is being spent to try to salvage them. since they are dangerous to use in investigating scientific questions and making policy, i recommend that we export them to saddam hussein and hope that he uses them. the problem of how to formulate models to explain past data, to predict new data successfully, and to be useful in policy making is a first order problem in science. from my experience in research, consulting on several industry and governmental model building projects, and innumerable doctoral dissertation projects, i believe that we need a good how to build a model manual. currently much multivariate model building is still an art, not a science. if the manual could show us how to build multivariate models as successful as the model t ford, it would be a best seller. however, until it appears, the advice kiss is relevant and has been successfully utilized in many fields of science. an ingenious approach to model building is the maximum entropy (maxent) approach used in physics and linked to statistics by shannon, jaynes, and others. jaynes's (1991) invited presentation at this asa meeting provides a number of successful applications of the approach to statistical problems. in the maxent approach a model for the observations which maximizes entropy or minimizes cross entropy subject to side conditions reflecting given initial information is recommended since it is a conservative choice of model which incorporates the initial, available information. in addition, it has been used to produce diffuse and informative prior densities for models' parameters. also, in working on the problem of how to produce the pearson system of densities by maxent several years ago, it occurred to me that perhaps bayes's theorem could be produced as a maxent solution. with a little effort, it turned out the bayesian learning model, that is, bayes's theorem, could indeed be produced as the solution to an entropy optimization problem. thus maxent can produce models for observations, prior densities and a learning model with its associated posterior and predictive densities. this appears to me to be a fruitful, formal framework for model building, learning from data, and making predictions. i hasten to add that using a model to make predictions and checking their accuracy is critical in appraising the quality of models and their associated prior information, as geisser (1980, 1991) has emphasized. this is a direct way of evaluating the quality and usefulness of different prior information embedded in alternative models and their associated prior densities as emphasized by serious model builders and statisticians. that is, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it is noteworthy that more and more delicious pudding has been produced in recent decades. on policy uses of statistics, producing data to describe and monitor problem areas such as human rights violations, discrimination, the environment, business cycles, cancer incidence rates, fish populations, et cetera can help considerably to characterize problems, further understanding of them, and appraise the costs and possible outcomes of alternative policies designed to achieve what are considered to be desirable objectives. in the case of the international pacific halibut conservation program, which i mentioned earlier, this is exactly what happened with the institution of a joint canadian u.s. conservation program in 1923. by establishing a sensible catch limit, based on much information and a good understanding of the halibut fishery and industry, the halibut population in the north pacific grew considerably. by the 196os, the annual catch was about 50% larger than in the 1920s, all achieved with minimal interference in industry operations. this relatively successful conservation program (note that the atlantic halibut population was decimated) is a good example of how initial, extensive statistical information and subsequent statistical monitoring of a program's operation, coupled with a good, relatively simple behavioral model and sensible implementation policies, can lead to reasonably successful outcomes. perhaps some of our educational reformers who are dealing with other kinds of fish would benefit from study of the halibut conservation program. 5 on communication of results by statisticians to the public and policy makers, i believe that often there are serious problems. for example, consider the following exchange between a statistician and the president of the united states: statistician: president, my forecast of the rate of growth of real gnp for next year is 3.0% with a 1.0 percentage point margin of error. president: what the hell is a 1.0 percentage point margin of error? statistician: it means that a 90% prediction interval stretches from 2.5 to 3.5 percent growth. president: oh, you mean that the probability is 90 that next year's growth rate is between 2.5 and 3.5. statistician: well, a bayesian would say it that way but i mean that an interval computed over and over again from repeated samples of data would have a probability of 90 of including the random variable, next year's growth rate. president: you must be joking. there's only one sample of data. i'll stick with the 90 figure that it's between 2.5 and 3.5 even though i'm not sure what you mean by probability. why don't you guys talk so that i can understand you? this example involves a conditional probability statement, the one that the president opted for and a probability statement about the operating characteristics of a procedure for computing prediction intervals. knowing when to use one or the other of these probability statements in connection with various types of intervals, point estimates and forecasts, test statistics, et cetera has caused problems for students and practitioners for years. further; see jeffreys (1988, ch. 7) for a brilliant discussion of alternative definitions of probability. certainly, if we statisticians can't be understood, few will listen to us. to conclude, statistical data, reasoning, and methods have come to be employed widely in all sciences and in policymaking. the number of theoretical and applied statisticians has grown markedly over the years, and many of them have assumed leading roles in academia, government, and industry. to have these favorable trends continue in the future, we must work hard to improve the quality of statistical data and methods for communicating, storing, and displaying them. there has to be a greater emphasis on the production of ugly and unusual facts and explanations of them. more work has to be done on methods for learning from data and on building models which work well in explanation and prediction and are useful in policy making. in all these efforts and in applied work on data production, forecasting, marketing analyses, censuses and surveys, quality management and improvement, drug testing, legal statistics, and so on, if more statisticians want to assume leadership roles, i believe that there has to be more investment not only in the study of statistics but also in relevant subject matter fields, for example, medicine, biology, engineering, business, law, et cetera. along with many others, i view the future as being bright for statisticians and particularly bright for those who have solid training in statistics and a subject matter area. finally, the statistical association has to be given a good deal of credit for its constructive role in fostering the successful development of statistics in the past and present. let us all join in a toast to asa and in an effort to make it even more successful in the future.",169,26.3313609467456,4.99078651685393,0.287415730337079,4450,1279,19.4873206568712,14.4873206568712,65,2.11346208664865,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1992.10475168"

(anderson 1988) how familiar the tune, if not the words, of this reprise on the census of 1790. two centuries later, as final preparations were being made for the 1990 decennial census dress rehearsal, the united states office of management and budget [omb] concluded that justification provided for much of the content was inadequate. proposing that virtually all of the housing items be eliminated or moved to the sample questionnaire, and that several sample items related to employment, commuting, migration, and fertility be removed altogether, omb stated in part: we believe that the length of the questionnaires and the sensitivity of some questions may contribute to respondent resistance . this research strongly suggests that counting the population in large cities is complicated by suspicions engendered by questions not related to the population count. (gramm 1987) the burdens that information collections may imposenot the benefits to be derived from the data producedframed much of the orientation to the federal role in statistical work during recent decades. while hardly a new concern on the part of federal decision makers indeed, such considerations underlay the passage and implementation of the federal reports act of 1942 the essential balance between the burdens and benefits of statistical information seemed to many in the professional community to have become increasingly lopsided. arguing the essential ""wrong headedness"" of casting surveys and censuses as a burden on the public, richard rockwell expressed most poignantly the alternative view: imagine a nation with no interviews and no questionnaires. how would the people be able to speak to their government about their condition? how would the government be able to learn from the people how well it is doing and what the people's problems are? how would appropriate policies be formulated and evaluated, and how would the government respond to changes in the society and the economy? such a government would have little accountability to the people and no responsibility to relate its programs and policies to reality the people have a right to be heard through the data they can provide to the federal statistical agencies. (rockwell 1987) yet there are burdens associated not so much with the volume of data collected, but rather with potential misuses of the information provided and misgivings about the value of statistical data that are perceived by those from whom we need to hear. my second example illustrates the impact of such respondent concerns on society's ability to acquire critically needed statistics. in september 1987 the u.s. centers for disease control announced plans to conduct a national survey to determine the extent of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection in the general population. the proposed survey was to be one component of a national hiv surveillance system designed in response to president reagan's call for ""a comprehensive program to determine the nationwide incidence of the human immunodeficiency virus and to predict its future occurrence and to initiate epidemiologic studies to determine the extent to which hiv has penetrated the various segments of our society"" (hurley and pinder 1992) despite the operational and quality challenges such an undertaking posed, there was consensus that the survey strategy had sufficient merit to be tested. key among the practical and ethical considerations to be explored in the feasibility study was a test of the willingness of people to participate if they were promised confidentiality. reflecting on events that transpired as the field test of the survey proceeded, peter hurley and glenn pinder of the national center for health statistics observe: we were to find that any study focusing on aids and hiv infection would have to deal not only with the legacy of this epidemic but with the whole history of gay and minority groups' negative experience with the health care system. there was also speculation that cdc's decision to move forward with this survey was motivated more by white house pressure than by scientific need. we were to experience how suspicions deriving from many sources affect all our efforts to gain and to disseminate knowledge about the hiy epidemic ... we began this project with a general awareness of the sensitivity of the topic but were not prepared for the extent to which the broader community's fears and concerns would influence almost everything we would do. describing the fatal flaws in the approach to the first field test of the survey, hurley and pinder highlight the problems that resulted from the proposal to stratify the sample by some measure of hiv risk status. despite the scientific merit of this methodology, and even though no personal identifiers would have been required, the procedure was viewed as targeting particular groups and individuals, with implications of malevolent redlining. unable to appreciate the social and political ramifications seen by others, the survey sponsors did not speak to these in their explanations to community leaders. learning from this experience, survey sponsorsthrough extensive and expensive consultations were successful at a subsequent test site in allaying fears about survey participation leading to identification and discrimination. but another theme that we already know enough about the aids i hiv problem and that further study was wasting money that should be spent on a cure emerged. issues regarding how the survey was conducted became secondary to the essential question of whether the survey was needed at all. in the end, lacking a clear consensus on the scientific merit of a national survey, and absent enthusiasm from any relevant constituency for its conduct, the director of the national center for health statistics recommended to the director of cdc that the national survey not proceed. but the experiences of the field trials underscore the fact that understanding the perceptions of our respondents concerning the potential burdens we may impose must be given at least as much attention as we devote to the rigor of our statistical methods. as the leaders of the household hiv seroprevalence survey team conclude survey scientists who accept the challenge of gathering data on sensitive issues must at times face up to the task of building a climate of acceptance for their work and of developing efficient ways of doing so. they must communicate the methods of science better to the public. [emphasis added.) (hurley and pinder 1992) the changing context for the statisticians' work as a society, we face many issues. securing our global competitiveness, increasing quality and productivity, adapting to the changing composition of the workforce, overcoming pollution and other threats to the environment, addressing the needs of an aging population, and determining when to release new treatments for diseases are but a sample of those already before us. these and other difficult problems stand to benefit from the contributions that statisticians can make to our understanding, and from increased statistical literacy on the part of both policy makers and the public. the terms of reference for interaction between statisticians, policy makers, and the public have changed markedly since the days when members of our profession were largely concerned with ""coding, tabulation, and recognition and correction of obvious errors in data collection"" (anderson 1988). whether we as statisticians like it or not, we are faced with what jim bonnen has described as a ""growing, intimate embrace between statistics and public policy decision making"" which ""has greatly increased the significance and decision value of the statistics we produce"" (bonn en 1983). to this audience, the examples have become familiar over the past several years: the use of statistics in allocating billions of dollars under legislatively prescribed formulas; the use of statistics in establishing regulatory priorities in areas such as energy, the environment, and transportation; the use of statistics in setting standards for affirmative action and school desegregation. most fundamentally, federal statistics have come to affect directly the lives of millions of individuals: statistics govern cost of living adjustments for many wage earners, and social security payments for retirees; they define who qualifies for food stamps and school lunches; and they determine where services, such as schools and hospitals, will be provided. as william alonso and paul starr observed in the introduc ion to their volume the politics of numbers, so well i stitutionalized are statistics such as the unemployment rate, the money supply, and various price indices that the date and even the hour of their release are regular events in the political and economic calendar, setting off debates on the performance of administration policy and influencing both stock markets and elections. (alonso and starr 1987) the front page of the july 3, 1992, issue of the new york times bears witness to this contention. in the upper right corner the space traditionally reserved by journalists for the day's most important story the headline read ""unemployment up sharply, prompting federal reserve to cut its key lending rate""; the subtitle, ""blow to president."" but even as statistics have become so pervasive in our lives, both policy makers and the public have raised issues that focus not so much on the scientific merit of our method but rather on matters that attend the collection and use of statistical information. the misunderstandings, mispercep 3 tions, mistrust, and misgivings that frequent our stage challenge our repertoire. to be sure, there are and have long been those in the policy arena who understand the value of statistical information. to wit: in 1849, as congress was considering legislation to create a census board composed of the secretaries of state and interior and the postmaster general that would be responsible for ""[preparing] a bill which the statistics of the country will require,"" senator robert m. t. hunter of virginia encouraged this plan since it was ""especially important for the statesman to obtain a full and accurate view of all the parts of that vast society whose machinery he directs. he should have all possible facilities for studying our progress, and tracing the connection between cause and effect"" (anderson 1988). more recently, in his announcement of a series of hearings on ""america's changing profile,"" representative tom sawyer of ohio advised: it is important for policymakers to assess the needs of a changing and growing population, as well as to anticipate the demands on public services. we want to lay the groundwork for policies and programs that are sensitive to demographic forces ... we need to explore the juncture where information and policy meet. the composition and age structure of the population will present new and enormous challenges for educators, employers, public officials, and social service providers. sound and fiscally prudent policies must be responsive to the demands of a growing and changing population. (sawyer 1992) as well, there are among those responsible for the education of our citizens many who understand fully the importance of promoting statistical literacy. i think of dean hubbard, president of northwest missouri state university, who is working to establish a ""statistics for the common man"" course as a requirement of the university's core undergraduate curriculum. most of all, i think of the teachers in our nation's elementary and secondary schools who are working so hard to bring quantitative literacy to their students. without question, there are others in the halls of congress and around our country who share these perspectives. but the obverse is also true, and, i fear, far more prevalent. the oft told anecdote comes from a congressional hearing in the late 1960s, when a congressman was questioning statisticians from the census bureau about the projected scope and costs of the 1970 census. the tenor of his questions was highly critical. why did the bureau need to ask so many questions? did not the projected questions constitute an invasion of individual privacy by the government? and why did the census cost so much? bureau officials responded patiently to each question, although it was clear that the congressman was unconvinced. why did the federal government have to get so involved in collecting statistics in the first place, the congressman asked. after all, he continued, whenever he needed statistical information, he just went and looked it up in an almanac (anderson 1988). the lack of statistical literacy extends as well to industrial settings. brian joiner, interviewed for an article that appeared in the washington post last year put it this way: it's difficult to overestimate it as a problem for us . it's just as bad in the executive suites as it is on the factory floor there's ignorance of variation .. how to learn from data. every 4 week, managers get data that all fall within [normal ranges of error] so they end up reacting to noise instead of statistically significant information. ""a basic knowledge of statistics would make it easier,"" the author of the post article argued, ""for people to learn more from market research data, scientific research, customer services feedback and all the other information that organizations relentlessly insist on gathering. despite the fact that our lives are increasingly surrounded by risks and uncertainty, we have an educational system that virtually ignores any appreciation of statistics and probability"" (schrage 1991). most vexing of all is the problem faced by our citizens, who encounter statistics at every turn in their daily lives, yet often are unequipped with the statistical literacy required to evaluate the information. the ""rationale for teaching statistics,"" set forth in asa's guidelines for the teaching of statistics k 12 mathematics curriculum (1991), elaborates this encounter between citizen and quantitative information: raw data, graphs, charts, rates, percentages, probabilities, averages, forecasts, and trend lines are an inescapable part of our everyday lives. they affect decisions on health, citizenship, parenthood, employment, financial concerns, sports, and many other matters. informed citizens should understand the latest news polls, the consumer price indices, and unemployment rates. (p. 3) ""a public unable to reason with figures,"" writes lynn arthur steen, ""is an electorate unable to discriminate between rational and reckless claims in public policy. debates about acceptable levels of suspected carcinogens, about the efficacy of high risk medical procedures, and about regulation of hazardous waste all hinge on sophisticated understanding of quantitative issues involving data, chance, and statistical inference"" (steen 1990). ironic and at times frightening is the fact that the same public who has little knowledge about the analysis and interpretation of social and economic data has simultaneously vastly increased access to statistical data and to computing tools that enable virtually anyone to manipulate information. pathways to enhancing statistical literacy numerous pathways some already being traveled, others awaiting our footsteps may be taken as we work both within the asa and with colleagues in other disciplines and professions to enhance our citizens' statistical literacy. i want to highlight three avenues that i believe we have begun to traverse, each of which holds promise for our further exploration. these are the federal statistical system, our nation's schools, and the popular media. asa and the federal statistical system the bond between the statistical association and the federal statistical system is fundamental and enduring. the history of our organization, as chronicled in the presidential address of ray bowman, bespeaks the fundamental ties between asa and federal statistics. ""certainly in the period before world war i,"" bowman remarked, ""the association was largely concerned with improvements and use of official statistics, with considerable emphasis on vital statistics worked with the states particularly massachusetts a d ith the federal government particularly the census nd the treasury for 'improving the sources of statisti knowledge' "" (bowman 1964). the enduring nature of the relationship between asa and the federal statistical system is perhaps most directly illustrated by the record of our association in creating and maintaining advisory committees that have served both the system as a whole and individual agencies during the present century. in 1918 the joint census advisory committee of the statistical association and the economic association was created. in 1933, upon her appointment as secretary of labor, frances perkins called upon asa to establish a committee to provide advice ""regarding the methods, adequacy, usefulness and general program of the bureau of labor statistics"" (goldberg and moye 1985). later that year, ""on the basis of an understanding with the secretaries of the federal departments concerned, the statistical association and the social science research council jointly organized a committee on government statistics and information services"" to serve the statistical needs of the agriculture, commerce, labor and interior departments (bowman 1964). in 197 5 asa played the lead role in convening the joint ad hoc committee on government statistics (jahcogs) ""to consider all aspects offederal statistics to determine what areas should be studied further and what action should be taken by the joint endeavor of this committee, its extension and the associations supporting it."" at the end of that decade, in light of the findings of jahcogs, asa was the key actor in the proposal to found and establish the council of professional associations on federal statistics, which opened its doors in 1980 under the leadership of former asa president bill shaw. meanwhile, advisory committees to serve needs of newer federal statistical programs have been established in areas such as justice, energy and, within the very recent past, the environment. but even as our members have served and continue to serve individual statistical agencies by providing advice on methodological issues related to particular areas of inquiry, the problems confronting the federal statistical system have taken new directions. often the issues encountered by the agencies are less of a technical nature and more rooted in public perception and understanding or misperceptions and misunderstandings. concerns about respondent burden and the cost of data collection both to the federal government and to the responding population frame a great deal of current thinking about future statistical activities. the debate about the content and sample size for the 1990 decennial census vividly demonstrated how dominant these issues have become. while that census ultimately captured virtually all of the information data users have come to rely on, the concerns that were laid on the table in 1987 continue to engage the attention of decision makers in the administration and the congress. indeed, in the array of design alternatives now being considered for the year 2000 census, there are a number of options geared at reducing burden and cost either by sharply truncating the content of the census or by turning to administrative records as alternative data sources. the use of administrative records as a means to generate what have been called ""general purpose statistics"" holds great appeal for those who would cut cost and burden. it is also fraught with problems some clearly technical in nature, but others that go far beyond our traditional store of methodological solutions. proposing ""the fullest possible exploitation of sources that can be used as an alternative to direct collection,"" ross eckler contended in his 1969 address to this association: for government agencies this means that maximum use should be made of administrative records where suitable arrangements are possible. respondents are especially likely to object to supplying data which they believe are already available in other government sources. while eckler recognized the ""substantial efforts [that] must be put into coordinating and standardizing administrative records before the potential savings in using these sources can be realized"" (eckler 1970), his consideration of the issues did not extend to nontechnical barriers statistical agencies face. such barriers are exemplified by the june 1992 testimony of the civil liberties union [aclu], which voiced ""strenuous objection"" to proposals that would ""supplement or replace the 2000 census by developing, in effect, a federal agency clearinghouse of personal information currently held by government agencies."" urging that the administrative records proposal be abandoned early in the decade, the aclu recommended that the congress amend the privacy act of 197 4 to prohibit the use of personal information held by the federal government to supplement or replace the census (goldman 1992). thus, it is clear that our efforts to foster new approaches to maintaining and improving the quality of our statistical information base must embrace attention to public perceptions of our proposed solutions. my second example of a cross cutting issue ripe for greater involvement by members of our profession concerns what i believe is the thorniest and potentially most consequential issue facing the federal statistical system. this is the growing tension between the need to protect the confidentiality of individual responses and the desire to provide the broadest possible access to information. many researchers find access to government data increasingly desirable. the newer data bases are more comprehensive, of better quality, and with improved data base management techniquesbetter structured. at the ·same time, the individuals and institutions that provide the data residing on government data bases as well as the agencies that sponsor the collection of such information are becoming increasingly aware that the same technologies that extend analytical capabilities also furnish the tools that threaten the confidentiality of data records. factors that give rise to these concerns about the growing capability to identify individual records include the existence of greater numbers of microdata files, the increasing use of identification, the growing desire and capability to match statistical and administrative records, the greater consequences of disclosure, the possible increase in motivations for identifying individual records, and the fact that microdata files are harder to disguise. the vignette of the household 5 hiv seroprevalence survey illustrates many of these concerns. our federal statistical system derives its mandate for data collection and dissemination from a citizenry that demands at once both quality information to drive public policy and protection of the individual respondent from privacy invasion and administrative harm. in response to these crosspressures, agencies are actively pursuing various approaches. data encryption techniques are being employed in some cases; licensing agreements that extend responsibility for confidentiality protection to the data user are being implemented in others. striking the proper balance between permitting access to accomplish compelling and legitimate research goals, and incurring the risk, however remote, of inadvertent revelation of individual information is, i believe, a fundamental issue and challenge for all of us. through the recent publication of its ""surveys and privacy"" brochure, our committee on privacy and confidentiality has made an excellent start on improving communication with respondents about the meaning of confidentiality pledges and questions they may wish to ask survey sponsors. as we look to the future, the members of our association must lend their expertise to developing and implementing creative solutions that embrace the technical, legal, and ethical considerations inherent in ensuring confidentiality while enhancing data access. asa and our nation's schools since the inauguration of its quantitative literacy program in 1984, the asa has been a major force in developing and delivering, in cooperation with the national council of teachers of mathematics, a model inservice workshop for secondary school teachers in the area of elementary statistics and probability and has published curriculum units necessary for effective teaching of basic statistical concepts. during the last several years we have mounted 25 five day workshops in 15 states; this summer nine workshops, from idaho to puerto rico, are being conducted. through these workshops, coupled with numerous two day awareness sessions, we have reached more than 2,500 teachers and, in turn, some 350,000 young people. more recently, as you have no doubt read in amstat news, the opportunity to further the scope and success of the ql program has been afforded through the award of two additional grants from the national science foundation: one is supporting the development of a data driven curriculum strand for high school mathematics, and the second is supporting the development of a ql workshop model for the elementary mathematics curriculum. looking ahead, asa has been examining the possible expansion of ql efforts to include joint ventures with the national science teachers association and the national council for social studies. the success of the quantitative literacy program has been in no small measure attributable to the willingness of statisticians around the country, through the local chapters, to participate in the summer institutes and in service training activities that are fundamental to the program. with the establishment of asa 's center for statistical education, and 6 the cooperation of asa's chapters, the benefits of this program can be extended throughout the country. in my view, these educational efforts beginning at the earliest levels, and future initiatives that would integrate concepts of statistics and probability into learning in the physical and social sciences, offer an invaluable opportunity to introduce statistical thinking into the perspective each of our citizens brings to bear on his or her public and private decisions. as is so often the case, the success of an undertaking brings with it demands for extending its reach. thus, for example, we hear pleas for improving our dissemination of what has been termed good practice. we are confronted with questions about how the educational system can be changed to embrace ql standards. we are asked if similar curricula could be developed for ""statistics for the common man"" courses at the undergraduate level. we are queried about strategies for integrating statistical thinking into coursework in the physical and social sciences. most fundamentally, we are challenged to spread our efforts to those who are out of the educational system, particularly to the current workforce. not long ago, for example, i received a call from a colleague at the environmental protection agency. having read the announcement of our ""ql in action"" session at these meetings, he wondered if we could consider giving such a workshop for the staff of epa. at the asa winter conference earlier this year, fred mosteller lamented the fact that our good efforts did not yet embrace those currently involved in business and industrial settings. all of these suggestions and others i have not enumerated merit our attention and action. asa and the popular media ""a professional organization [of statisticians] needs to provide the public through the press, lecture platform, and radio with reliable information about the science of statistics and its contributions .. "" in his 1960 presidential address, morris hansen reminded us of walter shewhart's 1945 admonition to the association (hansen 1961). in the decades since, the avenues for media presentation of our work, and the proclivity of the press to report statistics, have grown immeasurably. unfortunately, public awareness and comprehension of statistical approaches lag far behind the pervasive presentation of data in our popular media. forty years ago, aryness joy wickens told members of this association: we owe the public .. a clear description of the general nature and limitations of statistics, with a simple measure of their accuracy, if it can be measured and a warning if it cannot. we cannot, and we should not, try to explain every technical detail, or to make statisticians of everyone .. (wickens 1953). we still owe the public this debt in 1992. our principal route to the public, i believe, is that same avenue that brings to them our data the popular media. to be sure, much progress has been made in this arena since 1952. in particular, we now find in much of our newspaper reporting, notably with respect to polls, a box that explains ""how the poll was conducted."" credit for the institution of this practice belongs to our colleagues in the statistical profession. and there are other encouraging developments. for example, a few years ago washington post science and medical reporter victor cohn prepared, with what i understand was considerable guidance from fred mosteller and others at the harvard school of public health, a guide to reporting statistical claims and controversies in health and related fields. directed principally at reporters, news & numbers urges a description of statistical methods used in news stories and poses questions that should be asked to ascertain the credibility of ""statistical"" claims: how do you know? have you done a study? what kind? what numbers lead you to your conclusions? how valid, how reliable, how probable are they? compared with what? (cohn 1989). more recently, the national council on public polls has published a brochure setting forth ""twenty questions a journalist should ask about poll results"" before reporting them in the media. as with quantitative literacy, our success in working with the media brings additional challenges. toward the end of june, david sylwester shared with me his joy that the local television station, in reporting the results of the latest bush/ clinton/perot poll, had included some description of how the poll was conducted. grabbing the new york times, the source of that poll, i told david ofthe elaborate description of the methodology that was included in the newspaper report. as i neared the end of the jargon free description, i read, ""the potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger."" ""oh no,"" david cried, ""did they really say 'sampling error'?"" progress is not without its attendant challenges for the members of our profession. to advance our citizens' statistical literacy, i would advocate further development of clear, simple, meaningful terminology and notation that could be promoted and used by our popular media in their reporting of statistical information. on a broader level, i believe we must accept the challenge set forth by the focus group on quantitative literacy we . should be more forceful in making the media do a better job of handling quantitative information, and calling them on it when they do a poor job. we should simply not stand for some of the things we see in advertising, or the misuse of polls, or the incorrect interpretation of medical studies. (sons 1992) in the three years since its establishment, the asa office of scientific and public affairs has made progress in meeting some of our objectives to promote among policy makers and the public an improved understanding of the need for and importance of high quality statistical work. we are, for example, more aggressively publicizing to the media sessions at these meetings that will hold interest for the public. we have set up facilities to enhance the dialogue between members of our profession and reporters to make our work more accessible and user friendly. much of the promise of our initiatives in scientific and public affairs has yet to be realized. to foster progress in this area, we have established an advisory committee for ospa, similar to those that guide each of the other major functions of the asa office. we are looking to that committee to assist us in assessing how far we have come and in charting strategies for future directions. whatever those next steps, i believe the effectiveness of our scientific and public affairs efforts ultimately will rest on the willingness of our members around the country, individually and through our sections and chapters, to lend their talents and expertise. those of you who are out in the real world are in the best position to inform the fundamental question, "" how can statistics be of use to our citizens?"" you will be our key to working with the popular media and thus to enhancing our citizens' statistical literacy. enriching our society i deliver this presidential address to you as a minority. i refer in this instance not to what i presume to be the visually apparent though that minority status does provide the occasion to share a final anecdote from margo anderson's history of the census. she writes: [in defense of his ""extravagance"" assembling a staff of 170 people to process the 1850 census secretary of the interior joseph kennedy) wrote that during his administration ""no pains have been spared to secure perspicuity of arrangement and accuracy of execution in the census."" such ""perfect work required that all the calculations and classifications should be made by responsible clerks in office, instead of being confided to females and other persons having no interest on the subject, as has been done on former occasions."" (anderson 1988) the minority status i refer to in this instance is my membership in the category of asa's constituents who do not have advanced degrees [ 15 percent of our members, according to data presented by barbara bailar in her 1987 presidential address] and my membership in the category of asa's constituents who do not work in academic, industrial, or government settings [ipercent of our members in 1987] (bailar 1988) a decade ago, i engaged then executive director fred leone in a conversation about what to me had been a puzzling circumstance. why, i asked, do we not have more state and local government statisticians among our members? fred's answer was instructive: ""you forget,"" he said, "" that asa traditionally has been a 'learned society' "" i believe that asa continues to hold its respect and reputation as the learned society for our profession. but i believe that we are, as well, ""a society that learns."" in recent years, we have come to recognize the need to enhance our society by embracing in our membership those who engage in ""statistical thinking."" in turn, we have, for example, expanded our range of publications to address the needs of a more varied audience: three years ago, we started to publish our student magazine st a ts; this year, the board of directors voted to acquire chance, thereby allowing us to offer a general readership magazine. most notably, with prodding and persistence from our past president arnold zellner, asa has mounted an aggressive campaign to attract new members and it is working! within this year, our membership numbers have swelled from our previously stagnant level of 15,000 to an almost amazing 17,000 plus! this success brings with it attendant challenges: we must consider how to maintain the traditional services and activities that support our scientific mission while fostering new programs that will engage a more broadly based membership. i do not yet have updated information to determine the training and occupational pursuits of our new membersour new computer will, at last, enable us to have statistics 7 on our own but i would hazard a guess that, as we continue to expand, many of our new members will represent less traditional ""statisticians."" in turn, we will need to examine more proactively the mix of services and activities asa provides, and should provide, to its increasingly diverse membership. i think it is noteworthy that as the board of directors has approached the selection of topics for our planning initiative, the areas that were given highest priority included two that are more traditional membership and publications and two that are more recent additions to our portfolio quantitative literacy and the promotion of statistical thinking. our success in addressing the concerns of the membership will rest heavily on your participation both in framing our focus for the future and in implementing the resultant initiatives. a decade and a half ago i participated in the asa 1 lsi conference on the transfer of methodology between academic and practicing statisticians. at the time the latter half of the 1970s that theme suggested heightened sensitivity to the need to blend theory and real world applications more aggressively but our audience was more or less limited to ""statisticians."" in more recent years, i believe we have begun to cast our net more broadly but i believe we still have far to go. for example, while i fully understood the impetus for lsi's creation of a committee to promote the role of statisticiansa committee on which i served i was truly concerned about what might be perceived as a rather self serving mission. it seemed to me that our more important mission would be to ""promote the role of statistical thinking."" i am pleased that the report of the lsi committee speaks to that need; and i am further pleased to note that lsi's newly created international association for statistical education recognizes the need to embrace statistical education as it extends to secondary and elementary schools, to the workplace, and to government and industry. in his 1990 presidential address to the royal statistical society, peter moore suggested that we need to nurture the preparation of ""statistically minded"" individuals, and that we need to facilitate the more effective use of statistical thinking within all departments of an organization. a major theme of his address, as i read it, was that we must educate the consumer and the potential consumer to better understand statistics and, more fundamentally, statistical thinking to add ""statistical literacy"" to his or her skills (moore 1990). in their 1992 asa winter conference paper ""training to promote the role of statisticians: learning to overcome our feelings oflnferiority,"" kenneth bryson and larry hartke advocated educating the statisticians to better understand and address what the consumer of our science wants and needs (bryson and hartke 1992) i believe both of these strategies demand our attention. if we wish to continue to heed the mandate of our founders ""to be of service to science and society"" we must heed the needs of the customers both in our professional societythe asa and in the larger society we seek to serve our customers in government and industry, whether they are on the front line or in the computer room; our customers in the educational system, whether they are college presidents, 8 classroom teachers or students; and our customers in the media, who most often bring our work to our ultimate customers our fellow citizens. it is these audiences to whom we must bring statistical literacy and these audiences who will determine whether statistical thinking makes a difference in their personal and professional pursuits. it is a tradition or at least a strong tendency for those about to prepare their asa presidential addresses to embark on this task by reviewing speeches of their predecessors. having done so, i incorporated in my closing paragraph selected words of wisdom from our past presidents. a few days later, i shared an admittedly too long draft with colleagues for their constructive criticism. with considerable concern, alison stern dunyak delivered to my desk an e mail response. a single line stood out: ""kill all the presidentsexcept hogg!"" it was bob hogg, you may recall, who told this association ""how to hope with statistics."" if i might paraphrase a bit, i would like to put my bet on hoping with the statisticians. as we endeavor to enhance statistical literacy, i believe we will enrich both our professional society, the statistical association, and the society in which we live.",259,27.2316602316602,5.21196653906139,0.278604849000425,7053,1965,20.6657083297066,15.6657083297066,13,0.37273725795367,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1993.10594283"

Stuart Hunter","1970-1999","﻿in august of 1988 when bob hogg was president of the asa he invited me as a vice president elect to attended my first meeting of the asa board of directors. i have thus been part of the asa board’s activities for five full years. it has been a period of many changes for the association: the new constitution, the newly structured board, many new sections, several new publications, a membership campaign, the assorted activities of the asa center for statistical education, and most recently the modification in the asa dues structure with its “cafeteria plan” allowing members to select their publications. these many changes are indications that the entire statistics profession, represented at this meeting by the asa, the ims, and the biometric society, is being challenged not only to meet the needs of its membership but also those of society at large. these are exciting times, much like sailing when the wind comes up. and 1 still have a year and a half ahead on the asa board of directors. i must remember to ask my favorite actuary bob hogg what my chances are of surviving. i’d like to discuss “statistics as a profession” and comment later on one initiative now facing the statistical association. let us begin by trying to capturing what it means when individuals call themselves “professional.” to me a professional in statistics is a person whose every day work consisted of making sense of data and, equally as important, in the planning for information laden data. the handling of data is for these professionals a full time occu pation. many spend their careers in the service of govern ments gathering and elucidating official statistics. others employ sophisticated mathematics and graphics in the search for structure within their data, all while recognizing the role of noise, the fog, the variance that attends all data. they are familiar with the problems of taking decisions under uncer tainty. and they are concerned with inferential processes that begin with detailed events and proceed to the establish ment of broad generalities. in this final role they can be viewed as acolytes of the scientific method, attempting in the dark of the data to light the way to understanding, usually in the service of other professionals. together these statistical professionals form our essential cadre of working, or perhaps more appropriately titled, applied statisticians. and what of the remaining membership? are they not also working statisticians? yes, certainly working, but their labors are of another kind. these professionals are the build ers of statistical theory and the makers of statistical tools. many spend their careers in research pushing back the fron tiers of knowledge. they are skilled in mathematics and today are commonly found at the forefront of the computing sci ences. they are also our teachers daily engaged in attracting and educating students. these professionals are our academ ics. they are vital to the health of the statistical profession. a quick look now at our membership numbers over the past few years is instructive. there was little change in asa membership over the period from 1980 through 1992. the sudden spurt in numbers in 1992 is due to our recent mem bership campaign, and a final 1993 entry of nearly 19,000 members is forecast. ims membership has been at near steady state too. we can rationalize for these rather flat asa membership numbers. the social sciences, government, and academia have historically been major sources of asa membership. however, over the last decade the number of statisticians employed in the social sciences and in government has, i believe, changed slightly if at all. a similar picture appears for academia. we find in the 199 1 and 1992 annual ams mss surveys, (mcclure 1992; rung 1992) that there were 700 full time statistics faculty in 1970 and 735 in 1990, a gain of 35 in 20 years. the number of statistics departments is almost constant, 139 at last count. the number of statistics ph.d. degrees offered since 1972 is almost a constant, hov ering around 270 a year. i conclude from these data that the future growth of the profession, and of the membership of the asa, simply will not be come from its historic sources of strength, the social sciences, government, and most par ticularly from academia. of course, numbers of members is not the essential issue. what is crucial is the relevance of the statistical association to society at large. our membership numbers provide only a convenient surrogate, a partial measure of our importance. the question is whether we statisticians, considered to gether, form a true profession in society’s eyes. i would define a profession as one that: 1) advances its art through research 2) communicates its arts through journals and meetings 3) educates 4) defines its art to society 5) advocates its arts to society 6 ) serves society 7) serves its members in advancing its art through research, the membership of the asa encompasses almost everyone contributing to the theory and arts of modern statistics. our research credentials are superb. in communications the asa’s major journal, jasa, has few peers in breath, depth, and general excellence. the asa is in fact the publisher of many scholarly journals, some in collaboration with other societies and all worthy of any profession. and what of our communications through meetings? at this huge affair co sponsored by the ims and the biometric society, over 1,200 papers will be offered ranging in topics from wavelets and neural networks to the misuse of statistics in sports. further, the asa participates in dozens of meetings on a vast assortment of topics often sponsored by its sections and chapters or with other societies. again the asa takes on the attributes of a professional society. we come next to education. we have already noted that some 270 ph.d.’s are granted annually in statistics, our in dian chiefs. that number includes mathematical statistics, statistics, and biometry ph.d.’s. unfortunately, it is more difficult to determine the number of students acquiring a master’s degree in statistics, our indian wamors. many schools lacking the ph.d. option have programs devoted ex clusively to the production of statistics m.s. degrees, many with the words “applied” and “quality” in their title. the annual number of m.s. degrees in statistics seems to be in creasing. it is more difficult still to determine the number of b.a. or b.s. degrees in statistics offered each year. i have the impression that this number is gradually increasing too. keeping better tabs on the number of non ph.d. degrees offered each year in statistics is a responsibility most profes sions take quite seriously. the asa should be doing more. and what of the numbers of students taking courses in statistics at the undergraduate level? in 199 i , one estimate of statistics department enrollments equalled 45,000. we all know that a wide variety of other academic departments also offer courses in statistics. at the ph.d. and m.s. levels, statisticians can match the academic performances of other professions. but most professions accredit their undergraduate programs by sub mitting degree granting departments to periodic reviews of their curricula, faculty, library, laboratory, and class room resources. statisticians do not. the asa has published (amstat news 1986) guidelines for undergraduate statistics degree programs. however, this guidance is far different from establishing an accreditation program. at the undergraduate level the asa does not meet the full requirements of a professional society. reflecting a wide spread concern over undergraduate sta tistics programs, the statistical education section of the asa has organized sessions to discuss accreditation, proposed new guidelines, and has conducted a survey of statistics depart ments. in 199 1 the section’s leadership, together with the srcos (southern regional conference on statistics), brought to the asa board of directors a proposal to consider copa (council on post secondary accreditation) require ments for accreditation. this initiative was not successful. there were many reasons: one was the heterogeneity of the various departments, another the variety of statistics pro grams that exist outside of departments, and another reason simply resources. an accreditation program would be very hard to establish and to fund. except for our lack of undergraduate accreditation, the statistical association does meet the professional criteria of devotion to research, communication through journals and meetings, and concern over education. these are, of course, the attributes of an academic society. but our discussion concerns the attributes of a fully professional so ciety. it is time now to move on to the additional criteria of defining one’s art, serving society and serving one’s mem bership. what defines a statistician to society? professions value their name and strive to enhance its value to the community at large. but as already noted, statisticians lack an accredi tation program that would provide at least an undergraduate definition to the word “statistician.” other definitions, such as that provided by civil service requirements for the title “statistician,” are lax. to the community at large a statistician can be someone who keys data into a computer, a sports number librarian, or a pollster asking questions on the tele phone. speaking frankly, the asa does not devote much energy to increasing society’s appreciation of the title “statis tician.” most students, after attaining an accredited bachelor’s or master’s degree enter the working world as beginning profes sionals. in every case they possess credentials that their professional societies have defined and are anxious to defend. but the process of producing young statistical professionals is in a flux. in the minds of many, the only direct path to professional status requires a statistics ph.d. of course, many able individuals come to our profession without formal sta tistics degrees of any kind. well now, if the asa cannot control the process of producing professional statisticians, perhaps it should attempt to define the product. and this, my friends, brings us directly to the matter of the certifica tion a mechanism for supplying credentials to individuals who wish to be identified, both personally and to society at large, as professional statisticians. similar to accreditation, the idea of certifying statisticians has been around for a long time. let me offer you a brief history. almost 20 years ago, a paper titled “should statis ticians be certified” appeared in the statistician (boen 1975). (a still earlier reference uncovered later is by aryness joy wickens who, in her 1952 presidential address, asked the membership: “. to devise a means for establishing the title certified public statistician ”) the issue was raised in r. l. anderson’s presidential address ten years ago (an derson 1984). two years ago a six member ad hoc com mittee on certification unanimously recommended to the asa board of directors that it implement a system for cer tifying statisticians (boen 1992). last year the asa board established a committee on certification to draft a proposal. the committee is chaired by dr. robert parker of vanderbilt university. a rather complete report was presented to the asa board at its april 1993 meeting. at that time the board unanimously passed the resolution: move that the board express its support and encouragement to the committee on certification for the steps it has taken and urges them to continue refining details of the proposal. the board will begin an outreach effort to insure that the membership un derstands the details and to assess the membership’s sentiment. since april the committee has tried to acquaint the mem bership with its proposal. outlines and details appear in the may and june issues of amstat news. an e mail bulletin board exists. letters to the editor of amstat news have ap peared, and committee members have participated in con ferences and chapter meetings, including sessions at this meeting. based on studies of information provided by a commercial organization skilled in writing certification type examinations, the committee has recently proposed to the board that a “job survey’’ be conducted to uncover the cur riculum topics and working tasks that together would define a statistician, so that later an examination could be framed to test for these qualities. the asa board of directors, at its meetings this past weekend, has come forward with the following motions: the board applauds the work undertaken to this point by the certification committee and encourages them to continue their labors. the board will actively solicit the views and concerns on the certification issue from all interested parties including chapters and sections, and will review the issue again at the december board meeting. these motions bring this audience up to date with official asa activities pertaining to certification. why do i consider the creation of individuals as certified statisticians to be important to the future of the asa? there is certainly nothing to be gained by certifying someone in his professional twilight years such as your speaker. confer ences and chapters don’t usually invite this aging statistician to discuss technical matters; they just want someone to speak on global topics at their banquets. the need for certification stems from imagining our profession of statistics in, say, ten years hence. research and teaching in statistics will have continued, and the credentials of the ph.d. and academic tenure will always have value. changes in the classification requirements for government statisticians may have occurred, but certainly very modestly. but what of those many young able people for whom the title “statistician” can today be mistaken for someone sleepily counting sheep? will society at large have any greater respect for these individuals at the close of the next decade? a proper credential designed to identify and define individuals as professional statisticians could in the future prove of great value both to these individuals and to society at large. fur ther, the organization offering such credentials would become recognized as the natural advocate of these professionals, a responsibility properly assumed by every professional society. the asa should seize this opportunity. there are additional reasons for favoring the creation of a credential identifying a professional statistician. consider someone seeking to hire a statistician. large organizations need no help in judging candidates for employment for they will be aided by their already existing cadre of statisticians. but what of the truly vast number of organizations that con template hiring their first statistician: small companies, small campuses, small manufacturers, government offices, and state laboratories. or consider individuals growing in statis tical expertise and experience within their organizations who would value external recognition of their statistical talents. certification would, i believe, directly serve both employer and employee as to what it means to be a statistician. then too, other statistical organizations have begun the formal identification of professional statisticians. as many of you know, the institute of statisticians and the royal statistical society have agreed, after several decades of sep arate existence, to merge into a single larger rss. the 10s had been established earlier to provide examinations for in dividuals outside academia who wished to become identified as statisticians. the rss had considered itself a scholarly society, the 10s a professional one. the new rss may now be considered to be both. further, through the rss one may become a “chartered” statistician and thus be formally rec ognized as an individual possessing professional experience and knowledge of statistics. the rss is now attempting to secure wider recognition of chartering across the european community. the asa proposed certification program, once past its transition period, will require an examination to test the depth of knowledge of candidates. some argue that such examinations will serve to stultify college education in sta tistics. faculty may teach only that material required to get students through the exam. many students may wish to learn only enough statistics to pass. these are certainly human frailties and deserve constant attention. but such arguments can be quickly reduced to a discussion of whether no stan dards are better than some. of course, examinations can also be used to bring new ideas, new tools, and alternative ways of looking at data into a curriculum wedded to old methods. (bayesians, please take note.) examinations written by our professional and academic leadership could prove a tremen dous stimulus to teachers and students of statistics. in england, in the late 1940s when examinations to identify statisticians were first offered off campus, names such as d. r. cox, h. e. daniels, n. l. johnson, p. g. moore, d. j. finney, e. s. pearson, and f. yates all participated. certainly, similar expertise in writing good exams is available today. the swiss, the australians, and the new zealanders are also discussing various formal modes of recognizing profes sionals in statistics. the international biometric society, german region, in collaboration with gmds (german so ciety of medical informatics, biometrics, and epidemiology) has since 1982 offered a “certificate for biometncs in med icine.” international interest has grown to such an extent that a session is scheduled at the 1993 is1 meetings in flor ence, italy, to discuss the equivalence of statistical credentials across international boundaries. but we need not look abroad for stimuli toward certifi cation. to many of us in the asa, the activities of the asqc ( society for quality control) may seem a bit dis tant. but the asqc is hardly an organization to be over looked, and we do share with them the publication tech nometrics. in 1982 a statistics section was formed within the asqc. let me show you their membership growth. the spectacular growth of asqc‘s statistics division membership must have an assignable cause. the obvious one is the awak ening of industry to the importance of statistics. thank you, dr. deming. 7 e 74 70 82 ms se s4 year figure 2. membership: asa and asqc statistics division. we should note now that the statistics division’s parent, the asqc, offers various forms of certification to its mem bers. the most interesting from a statistical viewpoint is the cqe (certified quality engineer). some 1200 cqe certifi cates were granted last year, and a similar number are an ticipated for 1993. the statistics portion of the cqe exam ination covers such topics as student’s t and chi square, sample size determination, interval estimation, elementary regression, and experimental design. good basic material. the point to note is that, in the absence of alternatives, the cqe may soon become industry’s pro forma identification of a statistician. further, i anticipate that sim ilar certification procedures containing substantial statistical components will soon occur within the pharmaceutical sci ences, the health services, and in the environmental arenas. the day may soon arrive wherein others will have defined to society what it is to be a statistician. then too, consider today’s computer, that storehouse of data and incredible abacus with its amazing graphical abil ities. as you well know, programmers have cut up mathe matical and statistical procedures into macros all neatly packaged and available to be performed in almost any se quence. software programs of stunning ability are now widely available. some statistical software programs i’ve seen will not only design your experiment or survey, they will analyze your data, identify the significant features, and even write paragraphs appropriately phrased in the latest statistical jargon. the rude question arises, “when computer programs of such sophistication and complexity are employed in the preparation of statistical reports, does the program user know what he is doing?’ or more to the point, how will society know? i believe it will be to society’s direct advantage to see, instead of the name of some self declared analyst, the im primatur “certified statistician” after the name of the author of such reports. yes, i think society will value certification. and not incidentally, so will those who are certified. in announcing its plans for certification, the asa certi fication committee describe its proposed program as vol untary. of course, it must be voluntary to satisfy legal con straints. but some have commented that asa certification will not be voluntary and that many will feel compelled to become certified. that’s a very reasonable comment. but why compelled? the answer is, given all other things are equal, when society grants a permit, a contract, or settles an argument, it is likely to declare in favor of an individual possessing certification. the essential point to remember is: society will value certification! carrying this argument further, if there is a service that the community at large will value that is not presently avail able, then assuredly someone or some organization will make the effort to provide that service. from that viewpoint, cer tification would seem almost inevitable. and who might provide this service, if not the asa? let me quote from r. l. anderson’s 1983 presidential address wherein he posed the question, “. do we need a national society of profes sional statisticians?’ ten years have elapsed since prof. anderson asked his rhetorical question. today, let’s dream a bit and attempt some further perspective. suppose such an organization was to come into existence. let’s call it naps, the national as sociation of professional statisticians. what would it be like? it would be a professional society without much of a research* orientation. it would undoubtedly hold national meetings and collaborate fully in technical conferences. it would ar range matters so that its members could receive a wide variety ofjournals, like jasa, jqt (journal of quality technology), quality engineering, perhaps technometrics and commu nications in statistics, and no doubt chance. it might even have its own journal, the professional statistician, a source of nonmathematical papers of interest to its members. naps would encourage departments of statistics and mathematics to produce more master’s degree candidates, and work at broadening the attractiveness of statistics to undergraduate students. naps would be active in abet (the accreditation board in engineering technology) and lobby to influence undergraduate programs in engineering and the sciences. it would be engaged in continuing education activities not de signed for statisticians but for professionals in other fields. and it would undoubtedly have a certification procedure complete with exams and experience requirements. it might even provide exams especially designed for technical spe cialties like market surveys and medical trials, others for k 12 teachers, and perhaps even offer an exam to identify para statisticians. my friends, i introduced naps as a dream, but as pres ident of the asa it becomes a frightening, disturbing night mare!! just for a moment consider the diversion of talent away from the asa, the loss of resources, the dimunition of the influence of the asa throughout society at large, and even the divisiveness amongst statisticians that might occur. disturbing thoughts, all! to quote an ancient cornish prayer, “from ghoulies and ghosties, and long leggety beasties, and things that go bump in the night, good lord deliver us!” and would we simply re live the experience of the 10s and rss in great britian, to be separated for decades only later to combine? fortunately, upon awakening from this nightmare, i’d discover that there is nothing that naps can do that the asa shouldn’t be doing and couldn’t be doing today. the imagined activities just described for naps are actually op portunities for the asa to seize. to gain greater relevance within the community at large, i believe the asa should offer professional identification to individuals who aspire to be statisticians. the asa needs to be both a scholarly and a professional society. i know it is difficult to get a leopard to change its spots, unless of course it is a snow leopard. that clever beast changes its coat to match its changing environment. the environment sur rounding the asa has changed dramatically in the last de cade. we must catch up. certification, if approved, won’t be easy, nor will it be perfect. it will require a transition period and the preparation and reading of portfolios. a job survey may be needed before an examination can be written. exams will one day have to be given. there are myriad organizational details to be con sidered and resolved. it will require a great deal of work. and finally, it will be expensive and will have to be self supporting. it may be best that the full membership of asa take responsibility for making this important decision. i’d like to close this evening with some observations that involve kathy wallman, our past president. kathy received her bachelor’s degree from wellesley, a small citadel of liberal arts tradition and new england charm. i got my bachelor’s degree from nc state, a large land grant college offering degrees in the agricultural sciences and no frills engineering. kathy’s career in statistics wove together her interests in the social sciences and government. my career in statistics it erated between academe and industry. yet, though we started from near opposite ends of the collegiate spectrum and trav eled remarkably different paths, we became president of the asa in adjacent years. there’s a message here. statisticians come from many origins and arrive in many styles. we are a heterogeneous group drawn from govern ment and academe, from the sciences be they social, natural or physical, and of course from industry. we gather together within the asa for fellowship, for the exchange of ideas, and to provide the financial resources necessary to support jour nals, meetings, local chapters and special interest sections, committees, and a central administrative office. we try to be inclusive, not exclusive. we get on remarkably well to gether under this umbrella we call the asa. the association not only provides our intersection it defines our union and inscribes our full profession. and we certainly elect different types of statisticians to high office. i mention all this because we are today involved in the offer certification to individuals and thus become a much more professional society than previously. the issue appears di visive and may require a vote ofthe entire asa membership i hope, should voting become necessary, that you will re member that membership in the only an interest in statistics. frankly, i personally look for ward to the day when certified statisticians will be just as commonplace within the as tenured professors or gs 13’s or just plain members. there is room for all.",260,16.8576923076923,5.09924709103354,0.315993611681497,4383,1385,16.3349905315994,11.3349905315994,72,0.558602601461403,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1994.10476440"

Iman","1970-1999","﻿i want to use this opportunity to present my vision of some changes that i believe are needed for the future of the statistics profession. i have entitled my remarks new para digms.for the statistics profession. the word “paradigm” is derived from the greek paradeigma: para, beside, and deigma, example. webster s defines it as a pattern, example, or model. i think of a paradigm simply as how we view the world. in my remarks tonight, i want to be more specific and examine how statisticians view the world and how the world views the statistics profession. i want to state up front that i have a great pride in statistics and in being a statistician. i believe very strongly in the profession it is not just a way to make a living for me. such pride is easy to justify, because our profession influences every aspect of society. each of us could quickly make a list of fields in which statistics has had a fundamental and pro found impact, including: aerospace agriculture biology chemistry engineering environment : government jurisprudence psychology manufacturing medicine sports. this list only scratches the surface of the universe of areas where statistics can provide great benefits. unfortunately, the areas that actually utilize statistics represent only a small subset of this universe. furthermore, the subset employing professional statisticians is even smaller. last year, in his presidential address, stu hunter presented a graph showing the number of new statistics ph.d.’s from 1972 to 1992. does this look like a growing profession? in addition, from 1970 to 1990 the number of statistics faculty increased only from 700 to 735 an an nual growth rate of only 24%. does this sound like a growth industry? if the statistics profession were listed on the new york stock exchange, would you invest in it? if this information is not enough to heighten your senses, consider the fact that we are currently seeing some university statistics departments closing or being threatened with clo sure. last may i wrote a letter of support urging the regents of the university of arizona not to close its statistics de partment as they were threatening to do. during june i wrote another letter of support for the university of delaware, where the statistics department is under siege by so called “forward thinking” individuals in positions of power at the university. these universities are not isolated cases, nor are universities unique in this concern, as some major industries have either eliminated or are severely cutting back on their statistics groups through “dumbsizing.” if you have not al ready done so, i urge you to read my article in the august september 1994 issue of amstat news on this subject. why are we not growing when there is such a potential for growth? i believe the answer is that society does not place a high value on the statistics profession. it is incumbent on each of us to make efforts to change society’s paradigm of the statistics profession. we need to increase our outreach efforts for the future of the statistics profession, as well as for the benefit of society as a whole. if you take nothing else away from this presentation, please remember the following: there is no lack of need for statisticians: rather, there is a lack of the recognition of that need by society! to underscore this paradigm, we need only note that we live in a society that refused to give the asa a commemo rative stamp during its sesquicentennial in 1989, but turned around and voted on their choice for an elvis stamp! where is the ed deming stamp? where is the effort to get one? for the theme of this year’s meeting, i selected “increasing statistical awareness through perception, preparation, and promotion.” this theme is really about expanding our circle of influence through outreach, as this is a way to change society’s paradigm of statistics. but we must understand that before we change society’s paradigm, we must $rst change our own paradigms. change is not easy at any level, but it is both inevitable and necessary. hear the words of the philosopher eric hoffer: in times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists. dentist college professor doctor engineer farmer lawyer minister pharmacist teacher statistician. do not be surprised to find statistician at the bottom of the rankings you obtain even with lawyers on the list! you likely can recount the typical reaction at social func tions when you tell someone that you are a statistician. people will refer each other to a doctor, to a real estate agent, to a barber, even to a lawyer, but how many times have you heard “i know a great statistician that you should see”? why is the statistics profession not more highly valued by society? a lot of it has to do with the perception that we have created. roger hoerl, jeff hooper, pete jacobs, and jim lucas wrote a white paper concerning survival skills for statisticians ( hoerl, hooper, jacobs, and lucas 1993 ) in which they stated that “the statistical profession holds a small view of its responsibility to society.” let’s look at that responsibility by considering the 95%+ of college graduates whose only exposure to statistics is one or two undergraduate statistics courses. we have some in dividuals in our profession dick scheaffer, jim landwehr, doug zahn, ron snee, and roger hoerl, to name but a few whom i would term heroes for their efforts to cause us to focus on the importance of such courses. we simply must recognize the impact that these courses have on our profession and strive to give them a higher priority in the university system. at the asa winter con ference held in atlanta last january, ron snee listed some root causes of problems in the design and delivery of statis tical education, in which he included unstated or incorrect goals. i agree with ron. if goals are unstated, they will not be achieved. if they are incorrect, they will not produce the desired result. i sometimes wonder if we think that the only people who the of perception7 preparation9 and promotion overlap considerably; sometimes it can be difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. i would like to offer to these areas, beginning with perception. my view on new paradigms for the statistics profession employ statisticians are other statisticians. hoerl et al. ( 1993) referred to the inward focus of the statistics profession: we are our own best customers. much of the work of the statistical profession is intended for other members of the statistical profes perception. let me start with a quote given at last year’s meeting in ohio: sion. francisco by congressman sawyer from statistics should not be a punch line on an idiot’s program like jay leno. this comment was prompted by a joke that jay len0 made about pocket protector salesman having a field day during last year’s annual meeting. clearly, jay len0 will make jokes about most any profession, but the ready acceptance of his jokes illustrates statisticians’ image with the general public. you may want to try a simple experiment sometime. conduct a survey in which you ask people to rank the fol lowing professions in terms of their perceived value in their lives: we need to realize that the students in these service courses are our future clients and employers. our job is neither to entertain them nor to make them professional statisticians, but it is our responsibility to convey a sense of the value of statistics to them. i would like to challenge everyone teaching statistics to look at their courses in terms of customer satisfaction and to set a goal of making significant improvements each year. have you ever seen a class start with “i’m professor jones, this is the course syllabus, and now let me define what we mean by a quantitative variable”? there is no attempt to create student interest and “buy in” with this approach. a mental exercise that i have often done is to think about interesting and novel ways to the start the first day of class. each faculty member in a department should do this independently and then make their presen tations to the rest of the faculty. their pooled efforts would quickly produce some very effective approaches. a short term outlook would say that i cannot afford wast ing time on the first day of class creating student buy in. we must change our paradigm and look beyond the first day or even the entire semester to focus on the future of the statistics profession. such a focus makes it clear that we cannot afford not to create student buy in. bob mason has told me that he works harder preparing for the first day of class than for any other day. i wrote this talk last january, long before i saw the program for this meeting in the may issue ofamstat news, in which i was pleasantly surprised to see a session scheduled for thursday entitled “the first day of class.” ron snee, writing about what’s missing in statistical ed ucation, says that “people will study statistics if they see value in it.” let me ask you to think for a minute about why you go to the annual meeting and other similar meetings. clearly, you are not being forced to do so; rather, you see value in going to sessions and interfacing with your colleagues. on the other hand, the all too frequent attitude of students is “i have to take statistics.” wouldn’t it be great if we could change that attitude to ‘‘i get to take statistics.” this would be a major paradigm shift! some in the audience may now be thinking that i have been away from the classroom too long, or have spent too much time in the new mexico sun. be that as it may, my point is quite simple: these courses provide us with an op portunity to convince students of the value of statistics. this is the only opportunity that we will ever have to do so for most students. it is worth recalling the adage that “you only get one chance to make a good first impression.” otherwise, i fear that we are dealing ourselves a fatal blow with respect to our future customers and missing a golden opportunity to reach out to society. last year, i took the lead in helping the asa develop vision and mission statements to serve as a guide on where we are headed as an organization and how we are going to get there. i am quite pleased that many of the organizational units within the asa have developed their own vision and mission statements. i believe that the time and introspection that go into the development of such statements is of utmost value. each of us could profit by developing such statements for ourselves and for our respective organizations. for ex ample, a statistics department might have the following vi sion: every student who takes a statistics course from us will regard it as the most valuable course he or she had in college. how’s that for a paradigm shift! its certainly a long way removed from bob hog’s 199 1 comment in the statistician: to be blunt, many of us are lousy teachers, and our efforts to improve are feeble. so students frequently view statistics as the worst course taken in college. last month i had a meeting with the convention coordi nator at the albuquerque hilton in which the subject of statistics came up. she said the only thing she could remem ber about statistics was “null and void.” today i gave an interview to a feature writer for a toronto newspapers, who stated that statistics was viewed as a difficult course but said nothing about its usefulness. we must make the effort re quired to change such paradigms. a consultant might have the following vision: every person that i consult with will truly gain an appreciation for the usefulness of statistics and will become a customer for life. let me move to another area where i believe a paradigm shift is needed to bring about changes in perceptions. i once attended a meeting in which the chair of a committee that had reviewed a highly publicized risk study written by en gineers was very critical of the study for what he termed their use of bad statistics. i asked him why statisticians were not involved when their expertise was so clearly needed. he re plied that statisticians are of two types bayesians and clas sicists and the two don’t speak to one another! who is responsible for creating this impression? certainly not the engineering community. i have used this example because i believe it illustrates how easy it is to convey a bad or misleading impression. we need to realize that even in joking, we run the risk of conveying the impression that, even as trained professionals, we cannot agree. therefore, why should anyone perceive value in what we have to offer? perceptions like this are difficult to overcome and are very harmful to the statistics profession. unfortunately, we bear the responsibility for creating them. let me close my remarks on perception with a potpourri of less serious examples of how each of us can make small paradigm shifts that will contribute to increasing society’s perception of the value of statistics:0let we should quit quoting disraeli: “lies, damned lies, and statistics.” lets change it to “lies, damned lies, and politics.” after all, we should give credit where credit is due. let’s replace “how to lie with statistics” with “how to tell the truth with statistics.” we need to minimize our use of the expression “in the real world.” what does this convey to the person who hears it? quite simply, what we are doing is not real! we are also guilty of using such expressions as “quick and dirty” analysis. let me ask how many in the au dience would seek medical help from individuals known for their “quick and dirty” medical procedures? me now turn to the area of preparation. preparation. if we are to impact society’s paradigm of the need for statisticians, then it is essential that we take a careful look at how we train professional statisticians. let me start this discussion by quoting two of my very good friends, whose opinions i hold in high esteem. at the asa president’s in vited presentation at last year’s fall technical conference in rochester, stu hunter stated: unfortunately, the fact that statistics is a profession containing both tradesmen and scholars is simply not broadly recognized. many of our academics see the profession of statistics solely through the prism of scholarship, emphasizing the production of ph.d.’s and the publication of papers in the refereed literature. as part of his well publicized quality journey, bob hogg wrote: it seems universities sometimes pretend that all of its doctoral students will teach at berkeley. while one can hope a few will, it is good to remember that most will serve either at liberal arts colleges or in business or in government work. mentoring must therefore be done in “people skills’’ as well as technical skills and research. because these individuals are both well respected and long time members of the academic community, i need not be concerned that these comments will be interpreted as an indictment of the academic community on my part. but i do think that on the basis of these comments, it is reasonable to ask what drives current training. is it the need for the acquisition of technical skills including theory? i doubt that any of us questions the need for sound technical skills, but does the acquisition of these skills, in and of themselves, provide a guarantee of success in either academia or industry? what is required for success? i believe that it is as simple as determining our customers ’ needs, and then proactively working toward their attainment. of course, this implies an inherent underlying assumption that we have recognized that each of us has customers and that ours is a customer driven profession. at last year’s annual meeting, david moore asked us to view education as a business and noted that many, if not most, colleges and universities tend to be inattentive to cus tomers. hoed et al. ( 1993) have taken a broader view, stating that little value is placed on serving customers outside the statistics profession. the customers of academia tend to be many and varied and range from students to the corporate sector. what kind of feedback is the corporate sector likely to give to the aca demic community? let me share some comments that i have heard from colleagues: communication and presentation skills are fundamental keys to success. courses are needed on improving com munication skills: listening skills 10 1 presentation skills 10 1 people skills 10 1. work with your customer to determine what type of training is needed. evaluate the quality of your product. recruit students from engineering and the sciences, be cause statisticians are poor scientists and focus too much on the esoteric. statisticians need to be trained to add value to their projects beyond basic statistical applications. we need to be recognized as broad based innovators. focus training on creating jobs for statisticians through the contributions they can make as a result of their training. at the president’s invited address yesterday, we heard dr. bill spencer, the president and ceo of sematech, tell us that applied statistics was a competitive necessity in the semiconductor industry. let me illustrate my latter points with an example from sematech, where marathon tests are frequently conducted on new equipment. one test that i am familiar with costs $50,000 to set up, $35,000 a week to conduct, lasts for 15 weeks, and has a total cost close to $600,000. the number of failures during the test is recorded, and the statistician is asked to provide a 60% confidence interval for the mean time between failures. this is easy for the statistician to do. but if the statistician’s training has focused on becoming a broad based innovator, he or she should be asking if the engineer would prefer a procedure that reduced testing time and minimized total expected costs, including the cost of losing customers by shipping equipment that does not meet customer expecta tions. the engineer would be unlikely to bring this thinking to the table, but he or she will be very receptive to it, as will management. i like the statement made by jon kettenring: industry needs holistic statisticians who are nimble problem solvers. now that i have pointed out some areas of concern, what can we do about it? i say we, because we need to recognize that this is not only an academic concern rather, it is a fundamental concern that influences society’s paradigm of the statistics profession. i think that one of the most effective ways we can address the issues that have been raised is through the establishment of closer relationships between industry and academia. i have strongly encouraged increased interactions between these entities. refer to this as a customer supplier relationship, if you wish. we had an excellent opening session at this meet ing, with a panel discussing beneficial aspects of closer in teractions. at last year’s meeting in san francisco and again at this meeting, subgroups of the department chairs/institutional members of the asa and the corporate members of the asa held joint meetings to discuss areas of mutual interest. many promising ideas are coming out of these meetings and results have already been achieved, as evidenced by the listing in the january issue of amstat news of more than 30 in dustrial internships for students. these internships need to continue to grow, because they have a powerful impact on preparing students to meet the needs of the corporate world, and this is only the tip of the iceberg compared to what can be accomplished. i have encouraged academia and industry to work together and form partnerships. i believe that this is our best hope to bring about meaningful and lasting change. the problems that we face today are too complex for any one entity to solve in isolation. in my mind, academia and industry not working together makes no more sense that hitching two teams of horses to the opposite ends of a wagon. partnerships can have a very positive impact on training. earlier this year, i visited the statistics department at the university of south carolina, which has created a master’s degree program in industrial statistics. a unique feature of this program is that students must have two years of industrial experience before they can get into it. the faculty has worked with industry to modify their courses to meet the needs of their customers and are teaching during off hours when stu dents are available. iowa state is just starting an innovative program in which they will videotape courses for use by in dividuals at general motors interested in pursuing a master’s degree. partnerships can also form the basis for a formal mech anism for widespread two way employee exchanges. these exchanges are very beneficial to both parties. i have had sev eral professors work for me over the years. these relation ships have opened up new areas of research for them, estab lished sources of funding, and enabled them to carry this experience back to the classroom. i have benefitted from their assistance, particularly from them being able to devote a block of time to a particular messy, complicated, and time consuming problem that is also of interest to them. oppor tunities also have been opened up for the placement of stu dents. it is important that exchanges not be viewed as a one way street, because industry has a lot to offer by coming to aca demia. it is also important to extend the bounds of such exchanges and not limit them to those institutions that hap pen to be linked geographically. is there a role for the asa in forming partnerships? ab solutely! the asa can play a major role and serve as a fa cilitator in forming partnerships. consider how easy it was for the asa to get information out to all its members re garding the internships for students. we need to make part nerships a priority and address them on a broad scale. let me now turn to the last area of my discussion, promotion. promotion. joel barker, in his book future edge, states there are three keys to the future of any organization that wants to participate fully in the 21st century. these keys, which apply to both profit and nonprofit organizations, are: anticipation innovation excellence. excellence is derived from the philosophy of deming and juran, and simply represents the price you pay to play the game. innovation, when combined with excellence, gives you the competitive edge. anticipation provides you with the in formation that allows you to be in the right place at the right time with your excellent innovative product or service. i agree with barker’s observations and try to follow his keys in my work. but i have found that you need to have an active promotion effort to complete the package, or as we frequently say in my business, we need a marketing plan. let me share some ideas with you on promotion. earlier this year, the asa received an invitation from the institute of industrial engineers to co sponsor their third international symposium on productivity and quality im provement with a focus on government. the iie produces 45 conferences and seminars each year for their membership base of 35,000. the iie identifies industrial engineers as the change masters in leading the way in re engineering and pro cess improvement. what a golden opportunity for the statistics profession! we have a chance to form a partnership that would provide us with a very positive way to promote the statistics profes sion. but we need to do much more than just lend our name to this conference we need to start an active dialogue with the iie and see if we can develop relevant continuing edu cation courses, most likely through our q&p and spes sec tions, that meet the needs of their members. as hoed and colleagues have pointed out, we have spent too many years with an internal focus and on developing courses to be taught to just our own members. we can no longer afford this narrow focus. we might also see whether we can sponsor joint sessions at iie meetings showing the usefulness of statistics in meeting their needs. we need to set up a display booth at these meetings showing how statistics can save resources and improve their product. let me provide one simple example to illustrate this latter point. at last year’s fall technical conference, garry athoe and richard snary, statisticians employed by gm of canada, and jock mackay of the university of waterloo made a presentation showing how they had improved hardness measurements on recycled steel. their work resulted in a cost savings to the company of millions of dollars. these are the kind of results that will get management’s attention and create a demand for statisticians $they are made known. in my business we refer to this as a success story. in this era of tight budgets, it is imperative that we publicize such stories. our profession has an abundance of success stones, but we too often take them for granted. our criteria for publicizing the results of such studies fo cuses on whether any new statistical methods were developed, when we actually should be asking if any new jobs created for statisticians. that is, we continue to focus inward, when the real benefit to the profession lies in an outward focus. the good news about the iie invitation is that the door has been opened for increased interaction. the bad news is that the iie extended the invitation, rather than the asa taking the initiative. the iie is just one example of where we need to look to promote the statistics profession with other associations. ron snee has called on the asa leadership to help enable the development of partnerships between statistics and other disciplines. we need to make this a top priority and move on it now not study it for several years. if we don’t fill the need, someone else will. the window of opportunity is not going to wait for us to make up our minds. let me share a brief illustration of how we have used pro motion to good use at sandia. i began heading up a program with motorola in july 199 1 to evaluate an environmentally conscious low residue soldering process, which eliminates the need for cleaning with ozone depleting chemicals used in the manufacture of printed wiring boards such as those found in personal computers and automobiles. we felt that the technology was so promising that we needed to take action to promote it while making industry aware of our ability to meet their testing and optimization needs in this area. we summarized our findings in a very attractive report that we distributed widely. we quickly or ganized a conference over a six week period to get infor mation on our program out to industry. more than 175 individuals, representing 96 firms, attended. a second con ference scheduled for november to hear the results of a follow up program should attract hundreds. since the conclusion of the first program, we have had inquiries from more than 300 companies and organizations as a result of our promotion efforts. the success of this pro gram has brought favorable attention to the labs, an increased level of funding and more projects to our department, and more importantly, has created jobs. the statistics profession needs to follow the lead of industry and look for success stories and publicize them. there is no shortage of success stones, just a lack of promotion. this is an area that we need to take more seriously and get actively involved in. let us keep in mind that we do not have to be in industry to do promotion; we can undertake active pro motion efforts in the classroom or with the clients for whom we consult. in closing, let me say that i strongly believe that if we are to grow and prosper as a profession, we must expand our circle of influence through outreach to society. if we are to increase our sphere of influence, then it is incumbent on each of us to ensure that we put more into the profession than we take out of it. in this presentation i have tried to explain my ideas for accomplishing this through changing our paradigms. it has been said that a great person is an ordinary person with determination. let’s all accept this as a personal goal and see how we can increase society’s awareness of the value of the statistics profession.

Gail","1970-1999","﻿presidents are sometimes asked to make predictions and to chart a course for the future of an association. i am reminded of the president of the clairvoyance society who brought his family to orlando just last year so they could hear his presidential address. when he arrived at the swan hotel, he was astonished to discover that the annual meeting of the clairvoyance society had been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. i took this lesson to heart and decided instead to illustrate my theme, “statistics in action,” with two examples from the past: the advent of the randomized controlled clinical trial and the debate over whether smoking causes lung cancer. these two examples of statistics in action have increased the awareness of the impor tance of statistical thinking in medical and public health circles. sometimes the statistician’s work is highly visible, for example, in 1964, u.s. surgeon general luther terry issued a report, “smoking and health: report of the advisory committee to the surgeon general of the public health service” (u.s. department of health, education, and wel fare, public health service 1964), that summarized 15 years of intense study and debate and set the stage for efforts to curb smoking in the united states. statistical thinking, data collection, and analysis were crucial to understanding the strengths and potential weaknesses of the scientific evidence. this effort enhanced the stature and visibility of statisticians and the statistical method and gave rise to new methodologic insights and constructive debate on criteria needed to infer a causal relationship. these ideas form the foundation for much of current epidemiologic practice. at other times, the role of the statistician is less ap parent. perhaps scientific collaborators will change their minds about the quality or strength of evidence or per haps they will adopt a particular experimental design on the recommendation of a statistician. but even apparently small agreements that arise when the statistician finds an approach particularly suited to solving the issue at hand and convinces his co workers of the appropriateness of that approach can have unforeseen and wide ranging conse quences. for example, in 1946, a. b. hill persuaded mem bers of the whooping cough immunization committee of the medical research council (mrc) to adopt a random ized trial design for studying the h. pertussis vaccine, and, a few months later, he persuaded members of the strep tomycin in tuberculosis trials committee of the mrc to conduct a randomized trial comparing streptomycin and bed rest with bed rest alone in young patients with acute pro gressive bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis. these two trials set the pattern for the thousands of trials that followed and are ongoing in every area of preventive medicine and ex perimental therapeutics today. i shall emphasize statistical applications in developing the theme of “statistics in action” by elaborating on these two examples; the advent of a new paradigm for randomized comparative clinical trials and the struggle to use obser vational data to infer that smoking causes lung cancer. by highlighting applications, i do not mean to slight the impor tant role of statistical theory. without the proper statistical tools and principles, and without a close familiarity with the scientific method and with the strengths and weaknesses of experimentation and observational study, the statistician is ill equipped to contribute effectively to the solution of complex problems. but more is needed, including a serious effort to understand the problem itself, as seen by the scien tist or administrator or businessperson who poses it. as my mentor at the national cancer institute, david byar, often said, “before consulting on a problem in medical statistics, i read 100 medical papers for every methodologic one.” such multifaceted preparations are needed if the applied statistician is to play an inspired role. after reviewing these two seminal examples of “statis tics in action,” i will comment on some qualities and at titudes that typify the excellent applied statistician. i will also comment briefly on how we, as members of a diverse association, can benefit from giving a prominent place to applications and to “statistics in action” in our meetings and publications and also in our dealings with those outside our profession. 2. clinical trials 2.1 comparability and randomization why did it take so long to introduce the randomized com parative trial as a decisive method for assessing medical treatments? it was not because physicians were unaware of the need for comparability when making treatment compar isons. arrmtage (1983) reviewed the contributions of pierre charles alexandre louis, an astute clinician and patholo gist, who introduced the “numerical method” for comparing treatments. louis’ idea was to keep careful records on the results of treatments and to compare treatments on groups of patients with similar degrees of disease or illness r, as we would put it today, to compare “like with like.” us ing this method, louis (1 835, 1836) came to the surprising conclusion that “bloodletting has had but a very limited in fluence on the course of pneumonitis.” and this was not because louis and his colleagues were timid at bloodlet ting. they typically took about 12 ounces of blood in each of two lettings, or about 1; pints total. one patient died despite five repeated bloodlettings amounting to about 4 pints, or about 37% of the blood volume of a 70 kg man. louis (1837) explained his method as follows: i come now to therapeutics, and suppose that you have some doubt as to the efficacy of a particular remedy. how are you to proceed? you would take as many cases as possible, of as similar a description as you could find, and would count how many recovered under one mode of treatment, and how many under another; in how short a time they did so; and if the cases were in all respects alike, except in the treatment, you would have some confidence in your conclusions; and if you were fortunate enough to have a sufficient number of facts from which to deduce any general law, it would lead to your employment in practice of the method which you had seen oftenest successful. although the desirability of comparing patients “in all aspects alike, except in the treatment” was well accepted, it was not evident how to obtain such comparability. nonethe less, the idea that randomization might be a useful tool for obtaining fair treatment comparisons is more than 300 years old. according to armitage (1983), the belgian pharmacist j. b. van helmont offered to bet 300 florins that his curative powers were greater than those of academic physicians. he proposed in 1662: let us take out of the hospitals, out of the camps, or from elsewhere, 200, or 500 poor people that have fevers, pleurisies &c. let us divide them into halfes, let us cast lots, that one half of them may fall to my share, and the others to yours; we shall see how many funerals both of us shall have. today we would call this a “group randomized trial” and not recommend it because only two groups were to be allocated. the academic physicians of the day rejected this design too, though possibly not on statistical grounds. nonetheless the idea that randomization could yield a fair (unbiased) estimate of treatment effect is implicit in this proposal. but even if one has an unbiased estimate of treatment ef fect, measured by the difference in mean treatment response between an experimental and control group, one still needs a valid estimate of the standard error of this difference to determine its importance. in the 1920s, fisher described randomization as a method that could yield valid estimates of this standard error in agricultural field studies, because with randomization and under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect on any experimental unit, the variability of responses within treatment groups would be representative of the variability of responses overall and hence could be used to compute the standard error of the difference in mean responses (fisher 1925, 1926; fisher and mackenzie 1923). without randomization, complex trends in fertility patterns among plots could induce positive or negative correlations among responses within treatment groups and result in a biased estimate of standard error. fisher seems to have taken it as self evident that ran domization yields an unbiased estimate of treatment effect, but this idea is made explicit in the design of experiments (fisher 1935), where he referred to an experiment involv ing 15 pairs of plants. a cross fertilized plant was paired with a self fertilized plant and grown in the same pot, with pairwise randomization used to allocate the cross fertilized and self fertilized plants either to the east or west side of the pot. fisher commented on the role of pairwise random ization: this is to say much more than merely that the experiment is unbiased, for we might still call the experiment unbiased if the whole of the cross fertilized plants had been assigned to the west side of the pots, and the self fertilized plants to the east side, by a single toss of the coin ran domization properly carried out, in which each pair of plants are assigned their position independently at random, ensures that the estimates of error will take care of all such causes of different growth rates and relieves the experimenter from the anxiety of considering and estimating the magni tude of the innumerable causes by which his data may be disturbed. 2.2 persuasion thus the necessity for comparing “like with like” had been established as a principle of medical therapeutics, and the method of randomization had been used in agricultural experimentation since the mid1920s to produce unbiased estimates of treatment effect and reliable estimates of the corresponding standard error. why, then, was this technique not being used in clinical therapeutics? two hurdles had to be overcome. first, medical investigators had to be edu cated in the principles of experimentation and the need for rent rather than historical controls. in a reminiscence, hill (1990) said: at the outset, i think i pleaded that trials should be made using alternate cases. i suspect if (and it’s a very large if) that, in fact, were done strictly they would be random. i deliberately left out the words ‘randomization’ and ‘random sampling numbers’ at that time, because i was trying to persuade doctors to come into trials in the very simplest form and i might have scared them off.” through his writings and participation on advisory commit tees, hill endeavored to impress upon medical investigators the need for appropriately controlled therapeutic compar isons. meanwhile, hill (1990) was waiting for an oppor tunity to introduce strict randomization. (‘‘so i had been thinking about controlled trials for all of those 10 years and hoping the opportunity might arise.”) while hill was waiting, a remarkable study, “cold vac cines: an evaluation based on a controlled trial,” was pub lished in the journal of the medical association (diehl, baker, and cowan 1938). students at the university of minnesota were assigned to receive a cold vaccine or placebo by injection according to the following scheme: at the beginning of each year of the study, students were assigned at ran dom and without selection to a control or to an experimental group. the students in the control groups were treated in exactly the same manner as those in the experimental groups but received placebos instead of vaccine. all students thought they were receiving vaccine and so had an unpreju diced attitude toward the study. even the physicians who saw the students at the health service when they contracted colds during the period of study had no information as to which group they represented. today we would describe this as a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. the number of colds decreased from 5.9 reported in the previous year to 1.6 in the year of study for those given vaccine, but similar decreases from (5.6 to 2.1) were noted among students treated by placebo (see table 1). the au thors attributed these decreases to subjects’ inability to cor rectly remember the number of colds they had had in the year before the study. during the study period, the vacci nated group had 5 colds fewer per year than the control group. the authors concluded that “this difference in favor of the vaccinated group, although statistically significant, is too small to be of practical importance,” a conclusion since confirmed by cold sufferers. taken at face value, this paper would seem to be the first published report of a randomized trial in human subjects (lilienfeld 1982). but the paper included no description of a formal method of randomization. a typewritten manuscript by diehl, “adopted from the sigma xi address, delivered in northrup auditorium, university of minnesota, february 14, 1941,” describes the method of allocation in the 1938 figure 1. austin bradford hill. (reprinted from armitage 1977 with permission from the royal statistical society) random treatment allocation. second, serious ethical con cerns arise when an investigator controls the assignment of treatment to subjects in an experiment designed to obtain knowledge on treatment efficacy. compared to an investi gator who records and analyzes the outcomes of treatments assigned in the usual course of medical practice, an investi gator who controls treatment assignments, whether through random allocation or otherwise, assumes an entirely dif ferent level of responsibility for the welfare of the study subjects. the former investigator is conducting an “obser vational study”; the latter is conducting an “experiment.” in 1937, the editor of the lancet invited austin bradford hill (fig. l), known to his colleagues as “tony,” to “prepare for our columns a series of short simple articles on such methods as his experience of medical statistics had shown him would be most useful in that field.” these articles were republished as principles of medical statistics in 1937 (see hill 1971). in commenting on these articles and describing the “essentially innumerate medical profession in 1937,” richard doll (1992) noted it was tony’s genius that led him to respond to this situation not by press ing the need for deferring to a statistical consultant but by insisting that workers in medical problems, in clinical as well as preventive medicine, must themselves know something of statistical techniques and learn to accept statisticians as partners in research, who on their side had to steep themselves in the realities of medical life. for making treatment comparisons, hill stressed the importance of comparing like with like “at the beginning of the study, students who volunteered to take these treatments were assigned al ternately and without selection to control groups and to experimental groups.” this is the same allocation method that diehl had used previously in studies of cold medications. thus it appears that strict randomization was not used in the 1938 study. in any case, this work set a high standard for clinical studies, including a concurrent placebo control group, a double blind design, and careful attention to issues of endpoint measurement and interpre tation. hill’s first opportunity to use randomization was also in the “less emotive field of preventive medicine, a whooping cough vaccine or anticatarrhal was given to children in random order” (hill 1990). beginning in november 1946, children age 6 1 8 months were randomly allocated to receive pertussis vaccine (the “vaccinated” group) or an “anticatarrhal” vaccine that contained no h. pertussis (the “unvaccinated” group). parents were informed that some children would receive “anticatarrhal” treatment instead of pertussis vaccine and that parents and investigators would not know until the end of the investigation whether a child was in the vaccinated or unvaccinated group. only ch i dren who completed the required three vaccinations were included in the analysis. (today, most analysts would also insist on a comparison involving all randomized children an “intention to treat” analysis.) there were huge cycli cal variations in whooping cough rates during the trial (whooping cough immunization committee of the medi cal research council 1951), but the randomized design led to convincing results nonetheless (see table 2). significance tests were not presented. perhaps this is wise, because con ventional statistical tests, including fisher’s randomization test, assume that responses are independent, whch would not necessarily hold for an infectious disease like whooping cough. a. b. hill was acknowledged with the comment that “the trials were planned with the advice of the statistical research unit of the medical research council and were arranged and supervised by dr. w. c. cockburn.” nowhere was hill’s name mentioned, but his randomized design had contributed enormously to the credibility of this study and had set an important precedent at the mrc. it is one thing to test a vaccine on healthy children to prevent disease and quite another to conduct a therapeu tic clinical experiment on deathly ill patients. for example, how could one withhold the new potentially beneficial an tibiotic, streptomycin, from seriously ill patients with tu berculosis to obtain a convincing controlled proof of effi cacy? members of the medical research council’s strep tomycin in tuberculosis trials committee began grappling with this issue in september 1946, and a. b. hill, a member of that committee, could argue the need for randomized, controlled experimentation based on his experience in de signing the whooping cough trial. in pressing for controlled experimentation, hill had an able medical ally on the com mittee, dr. philip d’arcy hart, who was an expert in the treatment of tuberculosis. hart had just reviewed a century of studies on chemotherapy for tuberculosis (hart 1946), and his frustration with uncontrolled experimentation is ev ident in an introductory paragraph describing the strepto mycin trial (streptomycin in tuberculosis trials committee of the medical research council 1948): the natural course of pulmonary tuberculosis is in fact so variable and unpredictable that evidence of improvement or cure following the use of a new drug in a few cases cannot be accepted as proof of the effect of that drug. the history of chemotherapeutic trials in tuberculosis is filled with errors due to empirical evaluation of drugs (hart 1946); the exaggerated claims made for gold treatment, persisting over 15 years, provide a spec tacular example. it had become obvious that, in the future, conclusions regarding the clinical effect of a new chemotherapeutic agent in tuber culosis could be considered valid only if based on adequately controlled trials.” according to hill (1990), another crucial factor was the shortage of streptomycin. there was only enough strepto mycin available in britain for investigational purposes to treat about 50 patients. hill (1990) wrote: this i think turned the scales: i could argue with the chairman, sir geoffrey marshall (a good and sensible physician) and he would listen. i could argue that in this situation it would not be immoral to make a trial it would be immoral not to make a trial since the opportunity would never rise again (streptomycin would be synthesized, there would be plenty of it, and so on). we were limited to this number, about 50 in the streptomycin arm of the trial, and i thought that was probably enough to get a reliable answer so long as it was strictly controlled and if streptomycin was really effective. and so it proved. the trial included patients age 15 30 with acute progres sive bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis, for whom the only available therapy was bed rest. patient eligibility was de termined, and then a randomly selected treatment (strepto mycin and bed rest versus bed rest alone) was assigned at a central office, effectively preventing abuses of the allocation scheme. patients were not told that they were participat ing in a controlled experiment. radiologists and a clinician charged with evaluating the course of the illness over the next 6 months did not know which treatment the patients had received. results of the radiologic assessment at 6 months, ex cluding two randomized patients who died during an initial week of observation before treatment began, indicated an impressive benefit for streptomycin (see table 3). the dis proportion in deaths alone would be convincing ( p = 006 by fisher’s exact test). this report did not include a signif icance test, however. the report carefully outlined the de sign and precautions taken to assure unbiased assessment of radiologic and clinical findings, and presented a full and meticulous description of the various effects of treatment on temperature, weight, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ra diologic changes, clinical changes, toxicity, and bacteriol ogy. despite the trial’s impressive evidence of a benefit for. streptomycin, the investigators noted “first, that no clinical ‘cures’ were effected and that only 15% were bacteriologi cally negative (to direct examination and culture) at the end of six months; and, secondly, that this trial presents at the time of writing only a short term evaluation (streptomycin in tuberculosis trials committee of the medical research council 1948).” the report was comprehensive, descriptive, balanced, and, most important, convincing. a. b. hill was listed as a member of the streptomycin in tuberculosis trials committee in this paper, and the im portance of concurrent randomized controls was reiterated in the discussion: “the need of a control group in trials of a new drug for pulmonary tuberculosis is underlined by the finding that impressive clinical improvement was seen in some of the patients treated by bed rest alone (strep tomycin in tuberculosis trials committee of the medical research council 1948).” there seems to be agreement that this was the first randomized trial in clinical therapeutics. armitage (1992) discussed many aspects of hill’s attitudes toward and advocacy of randomized trials. cornfield then described an analogous study of medica tions for seasickness. men on one ship would receive one kind of pill, and men on another ship would receive another type of pill. as it turned out, differences in ballast caused more turbulence on one ship than the other, so that it was “impossible to know whether the differences in the inci dence of seasickness on the two ships could be attributed to the pills or to the ballast” (cornfield 1958). happily, the radiologists launched a series of multicenter clinical trials in which they randomized individual patients, not hospitals. in later years, cornfield was in constant demand as an advisor to groups wishing to begin clinical trials and as a collaborator on clinical trials. he chaired the food and drug administration’s committee on biometry and epi demiology, which developed guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials. ederer (1982) also alluded to cornfield’s concerns about the shortcomings of available statistical methodology for clinical trials. in particular, cornfield disliked the rigidity of formal hypothesis testing and the limitations of this approach in monitoring interim results from clinical trials, in examining treatment effects in subgroups of patients, and in following leads from the data with further unplanned analyses. reluctant to be con strained by rules designed to preserve the significance lev els, cornfield commented (cutler, greenhouse, cornfield, and schneiderman 1966) that “if maintenance of the signif icance level interferes with the release of interim results, all i can say is so much the worse for the significance level.” this attitude partly reflected cornfield’s deep criticisms of significance tests and p values as measures of evidence and gave rise to his pathbreaking bayesian efforts to confront these issues (cornfield 1966a, 1966b, 1969, 1976). before leaving the topic of clinical trials, i would like to mention another statistician whose powers of persuasion contributed to the acceptance of clinical trial methodol ogy: jerome cornfield (fig. 2). fred ederer (1982) reviewed cornfield’s contributions to the conduct of clinical trials. he recounted cornfield’s efforts in 1957 to convince a group of radiologists to randomize individuals to receive supervolt age versus conventional radiation cancer treatment rather than to adopt a proposal of one radiologist to treat all eligi ble patients in one hospital with supervoltage radiation and all eligible patients in another hospital with conventional radiation. cornfield (1958) took up the issue gingerly: i don’t want to disagree with dr. fletcher, but statisticians me sometimes practical and my own answer to your question is that i would welcome, personally, any kind of information that can reasonably be gotten. if there is a reasonable possibility of collecting information on the results of ther apy in different institutions under different sets of conditions, this is still information. if it is the best we can get, then let’s get it and see what we can make of it. there are any number of medical problems in which controlled experimentation is just out of the question. we try to make progress in those situations despite that fact. but at the same time that we collect this kind of information, or consider an experiment in which one hospital uses one form of therapy and another hospital uses another form of therapy, we must be conscious of the fact that, although this may be the best we can do, there are enough uncontrolled variables so that we don’t today, the fact that smoking causes lung cancer and many other cancers is widely accepted, and cancer studies that fail to control for smoking status are open to criticism. in 1964, surgeon general luther terry issued a report on “smoking and health” (u.s. department of health, education, and welfare, public health service 1964), and the u.s. pub lic health service has promoted smoking cessation efforts ever since. as a member of the public health service, i shall proudly refer to this report as the “surgeon general’s report.” since the issuance of that report, smoking preva lence has decreased among males age 45 64 from 52% in 1965 to 29% in 1992 (national center for health statis tics 1995, p. 151). the age adjusted male lung cancer inci dence rate peaked between 1981 and 1987 and has been de creasing slowly since then (ries et al. 1994). women began smoking in large numbers after men did, and the preva lence of smoking among women age 45 64 has declined more slowly, from 32% in 1965 to 26% in 1992. among women, age adjusted lung cancer incidence rates continued to increase through 1991. lung cancer has long been the most common cause of death from cancer among men and surpassed the previous leader, breast cancer, among women in 1987. these facts are so well known and the causative role of smoking so widely accepted that it is hard to imagine the de bates provoked by early observational studies demonstrat ing an association between lung cancer and cigarette smok ing. these debates touched on such fundamental issues as: can one infer a causal relationship from observational studies in which one does not control exposure assign ment with a randomized experimental design? what biases afflict such studies? how can one interpret the findings of a case control study in terms of a prospective measure of risk? many epidemiologists and other scientists contributed to the formulation and resolution of these issues, but none more decisively than cornfield and hill, with whom richard doll worked. it can be argued that the resolution of these issues laid the foundation for much of current epidemiologic prac tice. but the motivating problem was luhg cancer. lung cancer was seldom reported before the 20th cen tury and was uncommon in the 1930s. but since 1930, age adjusted u.s. lung cancer mortality rates (per lo5 person years) had grown from 4 in 1930 to 35 in 1960 in men and from 2 to 5 in women. cornfield et al. (1959) called the rising death rate from lung cancer “the most striking neoplastic phenomenon of this century.” 3.2 the association between smoking and lung cancer and advances in case control methodology in 1928, lombard and doering (1928) found an associ ation between heavy smoking (mainly pipe smokers) and all types of cancer combined, and numerous earlier uncon trolled case series of patients with lung cancer had sug gested an association with cigarette smoking (see references in wynder and graham 1950). muller (1939) found that relatives of deceased lung cancer patients reported more tobacco smoking among these cases than was reported by healthy men of the same age. this study was the first of 30 case control studies conducted from 1939 to 1963 and cited in the surgeon general’s report. in the united states, one of the most influential early studies (wynder and graham 1950) compared questionnaire responses of 605 male patients with histologically proven lung cancer to those of 780 hospitalized male patients with other diseases. wynder and graham found that 86.4% of cases were heavy smokers compared to 54.7% of controls. similar results were obtained from a special substudy in which the interviewers had no knowledge of whether or not the patient being interviewed had cancer. the point of this substudy was to try to reduce the possibility of “recall bias” that might result when an interviewer who knows the di agnosis consciously or unconsciously encourages different responses from cases than from controls. levin, goldstein, and gerhardt (1950) found that 66% of 236 lung cancer patients smoked cigarettes, compared to 44% of other pa tients at roswell park memorial institute in buffalo, and the protection against “recall bias” in this study was that the smoking data were recorded as part of the routine med ical history before a diagnosis was established. four months later, doll and hill (1950) published a study comparing 649 male and 60 female patients with lung can cer to equal numbers of ageand sex matched controls from the same hospital. patients and controls were recruited from 20 hospitals in london between april 1948 and october 1949. doll and hill demonstrated statistically significant differences in the proportions of nonsmokers between cases and controls and in the distributions of amount smoked among smoking patients with lung cancer and smoking con trol patients (see table 4). a strong trend of increasing risk with increasing dose is evident in these data (see the odds ratios in table 4). the paper by doll and hill (1950) was exemplary in pointing out the key issues for evaluating a case control study. these authors argued that the lung cancer cases and controls were representative of all cases and controls seen at the 20 london hospitals. but this condition is not sufficient to guarantee that an association between disease status and smoking in this hospital population also exists in the gen eral population. that would be true if cases and controls were representative of cases and noncases in the general population or if the selective pressures that determine who goes to a hospital do not depend on both disease and ex posure status. (see schlesselman 1982, pp. 128 131, for a precise statement of these conditions.) in trying to eliminate selection bias as an explanation of the association, doll and hill (1950) argued that hospitalized control patients had no lower prevalence of smoking than the general population. indeed, in a second report, doll and hill (1952) showed that hospitalized control patients smoked somewhat more than a representative sample from the general population of greater london, so that if anything, estimates of risk based on hospitalized controls would be too low. doll and hill (1950) controlled for factors (“con founders’’) that were associated with both smoking and lung cancer risk and that could therefore potentially account for the association between smoking and lung cancer. they matched on gender and age. the only other potential con founder they discovered was that more lung cancer cases than controls tended to live in rural areas. this confounder would not explain the differences in smoking rates between cases and controls, however, because smoking was more prevalent in london than in rural areas. doll and hill (1950) dealt with the issue of recall bias that might result from lung cancer patients’ exaggerating the extent of their tobacco exposure or from the interview ers’ knowing the patients’ diagnoses. in fact, the subset of control patients who were incorrectly thought to have had lung cancer when originally admitted to the hospital and in terviewed but who were later found to have other diseases also smoked much less than lung cancer patients. one of the main difficulties in interpreting case control studies is how to translate information on the exposure dis tributions among cases and controls into information on the probability of disease given exposure status. doll (1993) table 5. ratios of lung cancer patients lnterviewed by doll and hill (1950) to the corresponding estimated population size in greater londona daily cigarette consumption age1 4 5

per million population. bbased on fewer than five cases. later described hill as “a master of the method by which arithmetic is made argumentative.” (this had also been said of william farr.) some of this mastery is evident in table 5, which contains the ratios of the number of lung cancer cases interviewed in the case control study to the estimated size of the corresponding population in greater london for various categories of age and smoking status. doll and hill (1950) coupled census data on the age distribution of the population in greater london with data on the age and smoking status distribution among their control patients to estimate the sizes of the populations at risk for greater london, writing that “if it can be assumed that the patients without carcinoma of the lung who lived in greater london at the time of their interview are typical of the inhabitants of greater london with regard to their smoking habits, then the number of people in london smoking different amounts of tobacco can be estimated.” if, further, the case control study had included all cases arising in a year in greater lon don, then the ratios in table 5 would be the actual rates of lung cancer per person year namely, the lung cancer risk. doll and hill (1950) knew that the 20 hospitals in their sur vey did not cover all lung cancer cases and that many cases registered at these hospitals were not interviewed. these facts explain their comment that “it must be stressed that the ratios shown in this table are not measures of the actual risks of developing carcinoma of the lung, but are put for ward very tentatively as proportional to these risks.” this proposition would indeed be true if the age specific smok ing distributions in controls were the same as in the popula tion of greater london, if the probability of inclusion as an interviewed case in the case control study were independent of age and smoking status, and if all cases arose from the greater london population. provided that the elements in table 5 are proportional to actual risks, ratios of elements correspond to relative risks of disease. thus for people age 65 74, the risk of disease for a smoker of 2 5 4 9 cigarettes per day is 1,063/21 = 50.6 times the risk of a nonsmoker, and we say the relative risk is 50.6. combining data from age 45 74, doll and hill (1950) found the “relative risks become 6, 9, 26, 49 and 65 when the average number of cigarettes smoked a day are 3, 10, 20, 35 and, say, 60 that is, the midpoints of each smoking group.” thus by the magic of arithmetic and clear thinking, doll and hill had converted retrospective case control data on smoking expo sure into estimates of prospective relative risks. another remarkable aspect of doll and hill’s (1950) pa per was its effort to establish a causal interpretation of the association between lung cancer and smoking. doll and hill raised and discounted the possibility that lung cancer caused smoking, because “the habit of smoking was, how ever, invariably formed before the onset of the disease.” they argued that smoking was specific for lung cancer and not associated with other respiratory diseases and cancer of other sites. (this argument from specificity was later used by berkson [1955, 19581 and others to attack the causal hypothesis when it became clear that in fact smoking was associated with a great variety of diseases, including non malignant respiratory diseases and cardiovascular disease.) doll and hill also pointed to the strong dose response rela tionship between smoking and lung cancer risk as evidence of a causal relationship. to determine lung cancer risk. the cohort study confirmed earlier case control findings (doll and hill 1950, 1952) in several respects: cornfield was inspired by the work of wynder and gra ham (1950) not only to give up smoking (according to his wife, ruth bittler cornfield, they each gave up a 2.5 pack a day habit), but also to think about how to interpret case control data in terms of prospective risk of disease. using bayes’s theorem and smoking as hls motivating example, cornfield (1951) showed that the probability of disease ( d ) given exposure ( e ) is where d denotes the absence of disease. case control stud ies allow one to estimate the conditional exposure proba bilities p(eid) and p(eid). thus if one also knows the rate of disease in the population, p ( d ) , then one can use case control data to calculate the risk of disease. often one has no information on the overall disease rate in the population, p(d). even so, provided that the rate of disease is small, cornfield showed that the relative risk p(die)/p(die) is well approximated by the exposure odds ratio { p( eid)/p( eid)} /{ p( eid)/p( eid)}, which is estimable from case control data. here e denotes absence of exposure. thus cornfield had rigorously and independently proved that relative risks could be estimated from case control data, as had been illustrated numerically by doll and hill (1950). cornfield had also shown [see eq. (l)] that exposure specific absolute risks could be calculated from case control data, provided that the overall rate of disease in the population was known. he illustrated such calculations for lung and cervical cancer. the next year, doll and hill (1952) pub lished estimates of the rates of lung cancer according to daily cigarette consumption. these estimates were obtained by combining case control data on smoking history with data on the overall lung cancer death rate in greater lon don obtained from the registrar general. thus the work of cornfield and of doll and hill showed that case control studies could be connected to the underlying base popula tion (e.g., “greater london”) and could yield either relative risks alone or relative risks and exposure specific risks, de . pending on whether or not the overall disease rate in the base population was known. 3.3 from association to causation despite this firm theoretical basis for case control sam pling, such studies were not regarded as entirely convinc ing because of difficulties remembering exposure history, because of potential recall bias, and because sampled cases and controls might not be representative of cases and non cases in the base population. for this reason, doll and hill (1956) sent a questionnaire to 59,600 members of the medi cal profession in the united kingdom on october 3 1, 195 1; they received 40,701 usable forms. these 40,701 respon dents constituted a cohort that was followed prospectively 1. there was a striking confirmation of trends in relative risk with increasing tobacco consumption. the relative risks for men age 3 5 4 4 years for those smoking 1 14, 15 24, and 25 or more cigarettes daily (or its tobacco equivalent for pipe smokers) in the cohort study were 7, 12, and 24. corresponding relative risks from men age 4 5 4 4 in the case control study (doll and hill 1952) were 9, 12, and 22. (i have grouped finer consumption categories in the case control data of doll and hill 1952 for this comparison by weighting risks in table xi1 by proportions among controls in table v.) 2. cigarette smokers are at higher risk than pipe smok ers. 3. relative risk decreases with increasing time since giv ing up smoking. an important feature of the paper by doll and hill (1956) is the discussion of possible biases and alternative explana tions for the association between smoking and lung cancer. one possibility was that cancer was detected with greater probability among smokers than among nonsmokers; how ever, the same gradient of risk with smoking was seen for those with firm histologic evidence of cancer as for those diagnosed without histologic confirmation. a second possibility, raised by berkson (1955), was that healthy, nonsmoking members of the population joined the cohort study more readily than healthy smokers, introduc ing a differential bias in the composition of the cohort. but if this were true, then one would expect the greatest relative risks from smoking to occur at the beginning of the study, with smaller relative risks later as the initial cohort selec tion effects are attenuated. doll and hill (1956) pointed out that the relative risks remained constant. the potential weaknesses of the cohort design are quite different from potential weaknesses of the case control de sign, such as recall bias. the fact that very similar relative risks were obtained from these two different study designs indicates that the association found between smoking and lung cancer probably did not result from artifacts of mea surement or selection. the possibility of confounding by atmospheric pollution was dealt with by noting that gradients with smoking were seen in both urban and rural settings. berkson (1955, 1958) was suspicious of the observation that smoking was associated not only with increased risk of lung cancer, but also with cardiovascular disease and cer tain other causes of death. he thought it implausible that smoking tobacco could have such far flung consequences. although the principle of “specificity” of effect has been mentioned as one indication of a causal relationship, it ap parently does not apply to cigarettes. cessation of smoking leads not only to reductions in the relative risk for lung cancer but also to rapid reductions in cardiovascular risk. in june 1957, the study group on smoking and health, sponsored by the cancer society, the heart association, the national cancer institute, and the national heart institute, summarized data from 14 case control studies, 2 cohort studies (doll and hill 1954 and hammond and horn 1954), and laboratory studies and con cluded the sum total of scientific evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking is a causative factor in the rapidly increasing in cidence of human epidermoid carcinoma of the lung (study group on smoking and health 1957). later in june 1957, the medical research council in britain published a statement that concluded: in scientific work, as in the practical affairs of every day life, conclusions have often to be founded on the most reasonable and probable explana tion of the observed facts, and so far no adequate explanation for the large increase in the incidence of lung cancer has been advanced save that cigarette smoking is indeed the principal factor in the causation of the disease. it is clearly impossible to add to the evidence by means of an experiment in man. the council are, however, supporting a substantial amount of laboratory research which may throw more light on the mecha nism by which tobacco smoke and other suspected causative factors exert their effect (medical research council 1957). there remained skeptics, such as r. a. fisher, who stressed that associations that arise in observational studies need not reflect a causal relationship. fisher (1957, 1958a) mentioned two alternatives: that lung cancer caused smok ing, and that a third “constitutional” factor, possibly genetic, caused individuals both to become smokers and to develop lung cancer. regarding the first possibility, cornfield et al. (1959) wrote that “since we know of no evidence to sup port the view that the bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed after age 50 began before age 18, the median age at which smokers begin smoking, we shall not discuss it further.” then cornfield and his coauthors, in a masterful review of the evidence and objections to the causal hypothesis, considered the alternative “constitutional” hypothesis. they noted that “nothing short of a series of independently con ducted, controlled, experiments on human subjects, contin ued for 30 to 60 years, could provide a clear cut and un equivocal choice between” the constitutional hypothesis and the hypothesis that smoking caused lung cancer (cornfield et al. 1959). they adduced a series of facts that made the constitutional hypothesis less and less tenable: 1. lung cancer mortality has increased continuously in the last 50 years and more so for men than women. the simple constitutional hypothesis would require some mod ifications, such as the hypothesis that a new environmental carcinogen is acting on the genetically susceptible subpop ulation or that a new mutation is spreading rapidly in the population, to explain rapidly rising rates. 2. tobacco smoke contains substances that cause cancer when applied to the skin of mice and rats. the constitu tional hypothesis would require that such substances not be carcinogenic for human lungs. 3. cigarettes cause mainly lung cancer, and pipes and cigars cause mainly mouth and throat cancers. there would need to be two constitutional makeups, one for cigarette smokers and one for pipe or cigar smokers. 4. lung cancer mortality is lower in people who stop smoking than in those who continue to smoke. thus the constitutional factor must decrease with age, allowing one to stop smoking and at the same time to experience decreas ing risk from lung cancer unrelated to smoking. 5. another counterargument (cornfield et al. 1959) was based on the following theorem, proved by cornfield: if an agent a, with no causal effect upon the risk of disease, nevertheless, because of a positive correlation with some other causal agent, b , shows an apparent risk, t , for those exposed to a, relative to those not so ex posed, then the prevalence of b among those exposed to a, relative to the prevalence among those not so exposed, must be greater than t. in other words, for a genetic “constitutional” confounder to explain the relative risk of lung cancer of 20 or more among heavy smokers, that constitutional factor would need to be at least 20 times more prevalent in heavy smokers than nonsmokers. no specific factors satisfying this condition had been identified or proposed. cornfield et al. (1959) concluded: no one of these considerations is perhaps sufficient by itself to counter the constitutional hypothesis ad hoc modification of which can accommodate each additional piece of evidence. a point is reached, however, when a continuously modified hypothesis becomes difficult to entertain seriously. cornfield and his coauthors argued against other objec tions to the causal hypothesis. for example, fisher (1957) had pointed to the more rapid increases of lung cancer in men than women as inconsistent with “the memory of most of us, that over the last 50 years the increase of smoking among women has been great, and that among men (even if positive) certainly small.” cornfield et al. (1959) cited data on smoking in men and women that proved just the reverse and said that this preponderance of smoking in men con stituted “in fact, one of the links in the chain of evidence implicating cigarettes.” cornfield and his coauthors argued methodically, fairly, and at times with irony, to meet the various objections of fisher (1957, 1958a, 1958b, 1959), berkson (1955, 1958), neyman (1955), and many others. the surgeon general’s report appeared 5 years later, in 1964, and marked the beginning of a major campaign to promote smoking cessation in the united states. there had been an earlier pronouncement in the scientific litera ture by the u.s. public health service that smoking was the “principal etiologic factor in the increased incidence of lung cancer” (burney 1959), but the 387 page surgeon gen eral’s report was comprehensive, authoritative, and well publicized. it included topics ranging from the chemistry and pharmacology of tobacco products to psychosocial as pects of smoking. the surgeon general’s advisory com mittee on smoking and health consisted of 10 eminent members, including william g. cochran, former president of asa. this advisory committee obtained the “constant support” of nearly 200 individuals, groups, and institutions, among whom were berkson, cornfield, doll, dorn, gold stein, haenszel, hammond, horn, and levin, whose work i have mentioned, and several other statisticians in the public health service and at universities. the surgeon general’s report emphasized the findings of 7 prospective cohort studies, but also considered the results of 30 case control studies, carcinogenicity experiments in laboratory animals, and the descriptive statistics of time trends in lung cancer incidence, in gender differences, and in patterns of tobacco consumption in reaching its conclusion that: cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs all other factors. the data for women, though less extensive, point in the same direction. pump was removed, and the cholera epidemic, which had already begun to abate, ceased. this work shows as many other examples have shown that the highest returns can be reaped by imagination in combination with a logical and critical mind, a spice of ingenuity coupled with an eye for the simple and humdrum, and a width of vision in the pursuit of facts that is allied with an attention to detail that is almost nauseating (hill 1953). in reaching this conclusion, the surgeon general’s report recognized that statistical methods cannot establish proof of a causal relationship in an association. the causal significance of an association is a matter of judge ment which goes beyond any statement of statistical probability. to judge or evaluate the causal significance of the association between the attribute or agent and the disease, or effect upon health, a number of criteria must be utilized, no one of which is an all sufficient basis for judgement. among these criteria were the consistency of the association in study after study, whether prospective or retrospective, in various populations; the strength of the association, with relative risks above 10; the temporal puttern with exposure preceding disease; and the coherence of the causal hypoth esis with a large and complicated body of evidence. these criteria form part of a mantra of causal criteria used by to day’s epidemiologists and enunciated by hill (1965). this list also includes biologic gradient, typified by increasing it is the complex skein of coherence, in the face of many “facts,” that makes a strong case for a causal hypothesis from observational data. of course, experimental scientists use much the same approach to test all the implications of a theory by gathering new and various facts. this is perhaps what fisher had in mind in about 1945, when, according to cochran (1965), he was asked what can be done in ob servational studies to clarify the step from association to causation, and he replied, “make your theories elaborate.” part of this process requires considering alternative ex planations to the causal hypothesis and judging their plau sibility in view of the “facts,” as doll and hill (1952) had done in their discussion on “validity of the results.” corn field (1954) insisted that one has an obligation to seek out and evaluate alternative explanations even when an associ ation has been found in an experiment: lung cancer risk with increased smoking exposure; speci ficity of the effect of the agent in causing only one or a limited number of diseases; biologic plausibility; experi merit (for example, in a setting where disease might be prevented); and analogy with the effects of another simi to distinguish between statistical association on the one hand and relation ships established by experimentation on the other, without any reference to alternative variables that are present in one case but not the other, seems to us to be neither good statistics, good science, nor good philosophy though it may be good red lar agent. but a. b. hill would not be satisfied with a checklist. his aim (hill 1953) was no less than “the permeation of statis tical research with the experimental spirit.” if one cannot thus even well conducted randomized controlled experi ments require an appraisal of alternative explanations be fore drawing a causal inference. manipulate exposures directly, then one can at least “go 4. implications seek more facts, paying less attention to the techniques of handling data and far more to the development and perfec tion of methods of obtaining them. in doing so one must have the experimental approach firmly in mind.” hill re ferred specifically to his work with doll on lung cancer and wrote that “our aim was to make the field observations mirror an experimental design as nearly as possible.” he illustrated these ideas with john snow’s triumphant work that led to the control of cholera even before the bacterium had been discovered; “snow approached his problem not only as an incomparable master of logical deduction from observations but also, it should be noted, as the constructor of observations.” for snow, with one assistant, “tramped in the summer sun, learning for every cholera death the water supply of the household” and by that means demonstrated a death rate of 281 per 10,000 for houses served by the southwark and vauxhall company, compared to only 5 per 10,000 for houses served by the lambeth company. and then he explained apparent anomalies by seeking further facts. for example, a 59 year old widow living in hamp stead, where there had been no cholera, died of this disease a reader who has come this far might ask: “what does this have to do with me or with the statistical association?” for my part, it was reward enough to review these masterful papers and their resolutions of problems that influence our daily practice. i recommend these articles to you, in the words of an admirer (jean francois de la harpe), of the fableist la fontaine: “one should not praise la fontaine, one should read him, reread him, and reread him again.” and yet there are some broader lessons. we can admire and hope to emulate in some degree the personal qualities of people like hill and cornfield. both hill and cornfield were humorous and were wonderful speakers and writers. these skills made them persuasive in committee and as consul tants and collaborators. but perhaps an even greater factor was their sympathy toward collaborators. hill (1953) quoted greenwood (1924) in describing his approach to collabora tion and consultation: i used to see in the statistician the critic of the laboratory worker; it is a role which is gratifying to youthful vanity, for it is easy to cheat oneself snow determined that she had not visited d street but that she had drunk from a bottle of water from the broad street pump on august 319 1854. into the belief that the critic has some intellectual superiority over the criticized. i do not think even now that statistical criticism of laboratory investigations is useless, but i attach enormously more value to direct collaboration. the makine of statistical exueriments. and the denneation at snow’s recommendation, the handle of the broad street of statistical research with the experimeng1 spirit. it was this sense of the value of “direct collaboration” that allowed hill and cornfield to gain the confidence and af fection of colleagues in the fields of medicine, laboratory science and public health (armitage 1977). hill was an honorary fellow of the royal college of physicians and the royal society of medicine (armitage 1991); cornfield was president of the epidemiological society and vice chairman of the council of epidemiology and preven tion of the heart association (schneiderman and greenhouse 1980). cornfield was attracted to statistics as a field where di versity of interests could be advantageous (cornfield 1975). certainly cornfield’s interests were broad; he majored in history as an undergraduate and almost drifted into “the mental indolence of history” before his “random walk” ended in statistics. cornfield made notable ,contributions to statistical theory, yet he had no advanced degree. his writings range from confidence intervals for the odds ra tio to the philosophy and limitations of statistical methods (cornfield 1976). hill had planned to study medicine, but tuberculosis intervened, and after a 3 year convalescence, he studied economics in bed, going to london university only twice to take examinations (doll 1992). although he took courses in statistics at university college london, he “was more inspired by karl pearson’s ideas, philosophy and enthusiasm than by the mathematical niceties of his sta tistical methods.” in fact, “bradford hill never thought of himself as a statistician, but rather as an ‘arithmetician”’ (doll 1993). he had, however, “an almost obsessive fasci nation for, and grasp of, numerical information, and it is difficult to recall any instance in which his rather intuitive approach failed to reveal any important aspects of the data” (armitage 1991). like cornfield, hill made great contribu tions to medical statistics without specialist qualifications in medicine, statistics, or laboratory science. perhaps this lack of highly specialized training, coupled with natural intelligence and broad interests, helped hill and cornfield to identify important problems, to approach them from first principles with an uncluttered mind, and to understand people and practicalities. hill and cornfield were also favored by chance and by the responsibilities of their positions at the medical research council and the na tional institutes of health in being exposed to a range of exciting and potentially important problems. in any case, it was a willingness to take on important problems and, if necessary, to debate, that led to important practical results, to methodological advances, to a clarification of ideas for causal inference, and to high visibility and prestige for sta tistical thinking. we can learn much from these examples. for despite im portant advances in statistical methodology over the past 25 years, the work of doll and hill and cornfield reminds us that some of the most important elements of applied statis tics do not require advanced statistical calculation. seeking out important problems, working with colleagues in other fields to define critical issues and objectives, understanding the nuances of the consultees’ problems before attempting a quantitative description, expressing objectives in measur able terms, developing an organized plan (“permeated with the experimental spirit”) to gather needed data, paying spe cial attention to possible sources of systematic error (such as “recall bias”), interpreting results in light of various al ternative explanations, performing follow up experiments to clarify special issues, communicating clearly with col leagues about the meaning of the data for their problem these are critical elements we sometimes fail to emphasize. often the real challenges concern bias and systematic error rather than random variation, and a preoccupation with p values is misplaced. this was certainly hill’s (1965) view when he wrote, “what is worse, the glitter of the t table diverts attention from the inadequacies of the fare.” but the most important lesson we can learn from doll and hill and cornfield is to involve ourselves actively in the solution of real problems. in 1834, the royal statisti cal society adopted as its motto “aliis exterendum,” which means “let the others thrash it out.” i suppose the idea was that statisticians should be dispassionate gatherers and dis tributors of facts, but that the interpretation and ultimate use of these facts was for “others” to decide (hill 1984). this is surely not what louis, doll, hill, and cornfield have taught us, nor is it a motto that we can live by today. our challenge is to seek important new problems or help our consultees deal effectively with old problems, by providing not only technical expertise but also context, perspective, problem definition, decisive observational or experimental plans for gathering facts, and informed interpretation and opinion, based on knowledge of the substantive issues and experimental constraints. this activity may evoke hill’s fre netic image in a discussion of cochran’s (1965) great paper on the planning of observational studies of human popula tions: i suspect that in our approach to observational studies of the human pop ulation, there is only one material difference between professor cochran and myself. he, as he points out in an early paragraph of his paper, has (in this situation) largely served as a referee, or, at the very least, as a linesman. over the past forty years i have had to rush feverishly around the field of play, and, in this particular field, unfortunately, most of the missiles are aimed at the players; indeed it is not unknown for the referee to join in. of course we, as professional statisticians, face differ ent times and different problems. in many ways, we have more to offer than our predecessors. our statistical tool kit is fuller than those carried by practitioners even 25 years ago. we require more formal training to avoid injuring our selves and others with these tools. theoretical and applied methodological studies and advances in computing have put at our disposal a wealth of new statistical models, nonpara metric methods for data exploration, graphical aids, resam pling and advanced asymptotic methods for inference, ap proaches for handling missing or censored data, and other technical marvels. we also have access to a profusion of specialized journals and books, to relative ease of travel, and to electronic communications. now, more than ever, we are in a position to learn from each other from methodol ogists and from those interested in applications analogous to our own and to bring the knowledge and experience of a diverse and talented association to bear on our problems. now, through electronic communication, the possibilities for collaboration and mutual support are nearly limitless provided that one has the asa directory and a good sense of others’ interests. this, then, is an opportune time and it is our time to seek out new collaborations, to identify good problems, and to steep ourselves in their intricacies. it is our time to think broadly about the impediments to progress: is it a technical issue? a question requiring persuasion? it is our time to share experiences and specialized technical skills by discussing real problems and giving each other access to ideas that have grown and evolved in the partial isolation of our separate fields. it is our time to return to colleagues in other fields with sympathy, with enthusiasm, with a deeper understanding, and with a broader view, and hope to hear them say: “that statistician really understands our problem and will help us solve it.” that’s statistics in action.

together tonight but statisticians, and it is the role of the statistician that will be our focus. i came across babson while reading early issues of the journal of the statistical association (jasa). recall that our association was founded in 1839, the first issue of jasa was not published until 1888. therefore, it did not take long to read the journal writings of our first 50 years those of the second 50 did take longer! i now invite you to travel on a journey through the records of our first 100 years, 1839 1939, in an attempt to discover our past as a prelude to our future. for the first 30 odd years, jasa contained almost exclusively nonmathematical papers. many were mere repositories of extensive data sets, including many compilations from census counts with interpretations of what these data purportedly revealed. others were from investigations un dertaken by sociologists, economists, political scientists, and historians. yes, historians appeared frequently; the per ception that statistics was history and history was statistics was unquestioned in the 1800s. although there are numer ous papers full of theoretical developments in these substantive areas dominated primarily by economic including accountancy theorists, there is little to no such theory in statistical science. to be fair, we must remember we are talking about the period from 1888, when our journal started, until 1915 1920. nevertheless, there was an abiding yet elusive sense that significant mathematical developments were occuring across the atlantic by, most notably, francis galton. every so often jasa would contain a report on some paper from the royal statistical society or biometrika. there was some genuine questioning, however, as to whether those european ideas that were evolving from a biological setting would carry over to the nonbiological areas served by our members a quaint idea today, but one receiving serious cautionary thought back then. basically, there were two exceptions. one area that attracted theoretical attention dealt with the concepts of averages, variation, and distributions. today it is a mite incredulous to read holmes’s (1891) impassioned plea for the average, which, he bemoaned, “seems to have fallen into some djsrepute among theoretical statisticians.” his appeal was apparently heard, with the first major trea tise on the topic embedded in a jasa article titled “the theory and practice of price statistics” by r. p. falkner (1892). falkner’s principles are so basic and fundamental to statistical science that it would be easy to craft a com pelling story restricting oneself to words and phrases, logic and principles, and thoughts and vision solely from his arti cle without ever revealing his identity as an economist nor the application area through which his ideas are illustrated and developed. thus falkner talked about enumeration and comparison, that the “larger the number of units,” the “more accurate is our knowledge of (the aggregate in question)”; discussed possible “substitutes for the true average” (i.e., estimation) and raised questions about its value (i.e., how good is the estimator?); and brought in ideas of variation and of consistency without using the word. his arguments were all based on logical reasoning, with conclusions drawn from how the numbers played out on the illustrative data at hand. even falkner’s opening paragraph can serve as admonishing words to many of us today: there has often been noted in the development of statistical science a wide divergence between the theoretical, professional treatment of the subject and the views of practical statisticians at times the connection between the work of the theorist and the practical man has been wanting theory and practice have developed side by side (but) theory is not distinct from practice if, however, there is any distinct theory of statistics, it should accord not only with the practice of working statis ticians, but should indicate clearly and distinctly the general lines along which all statistical effort should be conducted. keep in mind, this was written in 1892! how far have we come more than 100 years later? the words may be the same, though we would concede that what constitutes the definitions of theoretical and practical statistician have changed somewhat. falkner practiced what he preached, in that he developed his theory to address a practical application. in fact, we could have relabelled his article identically but without the word “price.” as an interesting aside, we observe that an upshot of falkner’s ruminations was that for price statis tics, it was relative variations, not absolute amounts, that should be compared. this, he suggested, should be done by “tak[ing] the price of some one year, as 100, and ex press[ing] the other prices of the same series in percent ages of this price”; that is, the consumer price index so familiar to us today was born out of a theoretical develop ment fundamental to our science. falkner’s article sparked a slew of activity. holmes (1892) suggested that an average alone was inadequate. his vehicle was wealth (or, more correctly, wealth disparity), and he even brought in the concept of mixtures of popu lations. his article elicited the first letter to the editor, by one francis galton (1892), acknowledged by holmes in his reply as ”the most eminent authority on mathematical mea sures of distribution.” swain’s (1898) discussion paper on the method of av erages, mitchell’s (1905) review paper, and yule’s (191 1) book an introduction to the theory of statistics, reviewed in jasa by bailey (191 i), seemed to take care of the ba sic theoretical underpinnings for frequency distributions or so it may have seemed at the time. however, 1921 saw a burst of new articles on the subject. for instance, chad dock (1921) provided a method for the graphical represen tation of a frequency distribution, and for calculating the median and quartiles for grouped data (fig. 2). in a ma jor two article set, carver (1 921a,b) provided mathematical representations of the distributions of graduated (i.e., con tinuous) and integral variables, difference equation gradua tion (for unimodal distributions), and an application of the hypogeometric series (fig. 3). in what was a marked departure from the past, these articles contained equations, exponentials, integral signs the works. in parallel to the frequency distribution concept was the issue of graphs and tables. graphs (i.e., plots of frequen cies) as a visual aid emerged slowly through the 1890s, leading to ripley’s (1899) important article “notes on map making and graphic representation,” in which he laid the groundwork for general principles for graphics. these cov ered color schemes, choices in shading, and legends (e.g., if 1 10, 10 20, etc. have different shadings, where does the value 10 fit statistically?). nevertheless, years later, graphic art was still not an art, with no real concensus on how best to use this medium. consequently, a joint committee of repre sentatives from 17 national associations, including the asa, was formed to establish standards for graphic presentation of statistical and quantitative data to ensure speed. principle 1. the general arrangement of a diagram should proceed from left to right. principle 6. for curves having a scale representing percentages, it is usually desirable to emphasize in some distinctive way the 100 percent line or other line used as a basis of comparison. the concept behind this principle had itself been introduced as an important new theory by lorenz (1905). most of the principles adopted are so routine and familiar to us today, it is difficult to comprehend the inevitable impact of this report at the time. tabular presentations had been present from the start, and indeed many of the articles in our early years had pages of extensive tables a veritable treasure trove of data sets covering all sorts of topics (albeit with data of 100 plus years ago). as for graphics, tables too had become, to quote falkner (1916), “an extreme diversity in habits of expression, (defeating) the first purpose of statistical meth ods, whether in figures or diagrams, which is clearness of expression for groups of facts.” watkins (1915) contributed an article on the theory of statistical tabulation, and falkner (1916) went on to suggest several underlying principles of table construction, the most mundane of which was the im portance of giving each table a number for identification purposes. while stating a personnal preference that a ta ble also have a title, falkner stopped short of establishing this as a principle, though he did state that it should have a “short catch title” and not a long descriptive title. the analogies with computer graphics today need neither ex planation nor elaboration. the second area that received theoretical attention dur ing these years was correlation and related concepts. cor relation, and occasionally regression as we know it, crept into our literature in 1910 (haney 1910; h’doubler 1910), topic of considerable debate, with this attention continu ing into the 1920s. as we look back on these develop ments, we should keep in mind that these contributions came primarily from the viewpoint of economists. con currently, over the years there had been much interest in how to determine whether or not two curves (plots) were similar. thus, without using the word “correlation,” haney (1910) was clearly introducing the concept as he discussed the existence of a direct causal relationship between wages and prices both plotted over time. h’doubler (1910) sug gested instead of trying to eyeball graphs for differences and thence adjusting that one specify the two plots by. he then derived the formula for the slope. furthermore, he included a very lucid treatise on how and why the sum of squared er ror terms cef is used rather than the sum of the absolute error terms. incidently, h’doubler’s example was the comparison of annual marriage rates (q) with wheat prices (yi). this was clearly an important article, and it was quickly followed by a major and extensive treatise by persons took as its starting point a recognition of prior use in biological statistics by karl pearson (fig. 5). persons essentially posed the question whether or not the concept was valid in other areas including his own economics. he decided “yes” on the basis of several illustrative examples, mostly plots of two economic series. he defined correlation, gave formulas and many examples of regression lines, and even ventured into partial correlation. two years later, magee (1912) questioned the use of cor relation when comparing two series of index numbers (se ries that typically involved a time dependence component). index numbers, often price indices, as an entity occupied many pages of jasa; an interesting journey in itself, tracing the historical development of the relevant economic theo ries can be undertaken by those so inclined. i shall not take this direction here, other than to say that index numbers also provided the springboard for much statistical deveiop ment. so it was that magee demonstrated (by words and arithmetic) that the correlation coefficient was inappropri ate for series in which the element of time was of prime importance. he introduced the term “degree of correspon dence” to overcome these objections, but we now know that he was presaging the concept of autocorrelation in a time series. perhaps the most interesting aspect of magee’s article is his demonstration (again, entirely by words and arithmetic two pages worth!) that if z is replaced by z f k or by kx, then the correlation is unchanged. the story did not end h e r e in fact, it was still in its infancy and about to heat up. there was an exchange between magee (1914) and persons (1914a,b), where persons refuted magee’s ob jections to his use of correlation with such (time) series and then magee defended himself. however, time was apparently on their side, with per son’s (1917) article “on the variate difference correla tion method and curve fitting.” the focus was on series for which time, or space, is an important element. persons concluded that the new method of variate difference cor relation (introduced in a series of 1914 biornetrika papers: anderson 1914; cave and karl pearson 1914; student 1914) had great value. today, we know that for a first order au toregressive model, the autocorrelation coefficient of lag k is p k = 4k, where 4 is the autoregressive parameter. but reading persons’s article of 1917 is a tortuous jour ney as we travel with him through his numerous illustrative examples again, mostly words, though near the end he did derive a formula for the correlation of first differences. in effect, he obtained p1, but he was unsure about higher dif ferences (i.e., higher order lags). persons also noticed that for a series whose observations fluctuate wildly, his corre lation coefficient alternated in sign as the degree of differ ences increased, but he did not know why and clearly had not yet anticipated the 4k result as it pertained to 4 nega tive. also of interest was his conclusion that series of less than 35 observations are too short for these methods to be applicable. given the often indiscriminate use of standard time series methods on even shorter series today, perhaps a gentle reminder is in order. the year 1917 saw many more works on correlation. some authors took great issue at a contribution of an ear lier author; others offered explanations of its uses and of its limitations. reed (1917), a weather expert, explained how it was possible to have perfect correlation (as in his cyclical tide data) but nevertheless have a coefficient of zero, lead ing, of course, as we now know, to the illumination that the correlation coefficient was a measure of a linear relationship (fig. 6). day (1918) tackled some of the then still present confusions and attempted to delineate distinctions between some of the important concepts. the journal pages appear to vibrate with an unmistakable edge of excitement. through out, there is a pervading presence of intellectual strength and dogged logical thinking as the statistical community wound its way through the confusions of the closeness of fit of two curves, of association not causation, of the place of time as a relevant component, and of the distinctions between quantiative and qualitative data. their persistence was rewarded, with an apparent clarity eventually emerging on these concepts and their importance. also, the distinction between correlation and contingency tables had been drawn. as an interesting or provocative aside, the first (?) proposed use of the contingency table in our literature was as an aid in investigating the question whether “woman suffrage (would) be the doom of the legalized sale of liquor,” and whether those opposed to woman suffage were those same groups in favor of “the continuance of the legalized manu facture and sale of alcoholic liquors” (gehlke 1917). this assumed that they had collected the data correctly, which in fact they had not! further, contingency tables brought forth the first jasa entry from karl pearson (1930), in which he engaged in a heated exchange with a professor harris on the theory of contingency (harris, treloar, and wilder 1930). goodness of fit and the concept of comparing an ob served frequency curve with an expected frequency curve were not far behind, though here again there was an ap peal to the “english” school in adopting this approach on this side of the atlantic. one of the first applications of this method perhaps seems frivolous today. comparisons were made between the actual and expected frequencies of the longevity as in mortality of our public men (i.e., our political leaders president, vice president, congressmen and our college presidents) (fisher 1916). for the record, with the exception of the president of yale, these men had less longevity than expected, with the caveat that congress men had more vitality in their first term but quickly faded, with less vitality in subsequent terms. underlying these disputes was an emerging and concur rent tension between the mathematical and nonmathemat ical statisticians, where mathematical was defined as the use of correlation a tension that has continued to grow. although it is not surprising that there were little in the way of mathematical statistics in the early years, we did, however, see the mathematical mind at work as theoreti cal concepts filtered through in the guise of what might be classified as logic or philosophy, as authors developed rea soned critiques and logical arguments for the correct way to interpret the data presented. thus, in addition to those concepts already mentioned, we see the concept of probable error in work of pritchett (1891) and interactions in work of macaulay (1891). at the time, insurance companies associated an individual’s longevity with his or her weight. macaulay established the principle that many factors together with their interactions should be considered age, occupation, climatic influences and warned of the fallacy of taking one factor on its own in this instance, weight without qualification. as an aside, macaulay decided that age rather than weight was proba bly the most relevant factor in this question of longevity. age as a factor appeared frequently in a wide variety of studies. young (1900) presented a treatise on how best to decide what ages should be grouped together. seasonal ef fects made their appearance as a concept in an article by winslow (1902), although this article was important more for its contributions to a typhoid study. smoothing was dis cussed by cross (1908) and a method for computing the moving average (all in words) was given by king (1915). no reading of our early history can overlook the brilliant (and long) article “scope and method of statistics” (west ergaard 1916). this is compelling and fascinating reading. we could explore this work at length, but it will suffice to mention just one of westergaard’s topics here. specifi cally, in a long explanation over several pages (all words, of course, as was the custom of the day), he established when and why it can be assumed that the binomial probability has changed its value. in effect, he was testing ho: p = po (he also considered ho: p1 = p2 later) and essentially espoused the basic principles of hypothesis testing. the concept of an adequate sample size for viable con clusions, along with a caution about taking percentages. when the numbers are small was introduced in an article on women in almshouses by mary roberts smith (1895). (incidentally, the sociological conclusion was that “women be trained for two possible destinies instead of one, as men are self support (and) marriage.”) the welfare of women actually received much attention, and the articles frequently bore forth an important statistical concept. thus, in addition to the adequate sample size idea, a major ad vance in comparative theory comparing apples with ap ples, not with oranges was an important by product of smith’s (1900) study on the “statistics of college and non college women.” the controversy, to hear smith tell it, was “no longer as to whether a woman shall be educated, but as to how she shall be educated.” many misconceptions (some of which, unfortunately, still persist today) arising out of in appropriate comparisons were hence corrected by virtue of making proper comparisons. before moving on, for those of you who were wondering, there were indeed several studies on comparative wages, all concluding that women received lower wages than did men for the same work (see, e.g., conyngton 1896 and salmon 1892a.b). to restrict attention to these theoretical developments alone would paint a very misleading picture of the primary focii of our first century. on the occassion of the asks 75th anniversary in 1914, koren’s presidential address affirmed that we were an association of economists and sociologists with a few statisticians, by which he meant mathematical statisticians (see koren, 1915). to celebrate that occasion, special articles were published on the service of statistics to, for example, economics, sociology, history, and biology, with biology having a small but newly developing role. in reality, we were an association of practicing profes sionals who used statistics in the course of developing the ory and policy in sociology, economics, political science, and so on. we all know the story of florence nightingale (fig. 7). in his article on nightingale’s role as a statistician, kopf (1916) asserted that: miss nightingale’s activities in furthering statistical progress were the out growth of her deep conviction, variously expressed in her several papers, that the social and moral sciences are in method and substance statistical sciences. [and in several other papers] she asserts that statistics were to her almost a religious exercise. we surely would not quarrel with this dictum even today. it certainly, however, accurately reflected the substance of most of the asa literature, at least into the mid 1900s. however important the theoretical developments to math ematical statistics might be (and assuredly they were and are very important), they were in reality incidental to the bulk of our journal entries. for a journey through our early history is really an historical voyage through the prevail ing social history of the day. some of the conclusions and issues that attracted attention are outrageous and embarass ing when held up to today’s light. but most offer a fasci nating ride as we discover what the abiding and consum ing social and political issues were, how and when they emerged, and how (if at all) they were resolved. for ex ample, there were many articles on mineral production and on farm yields. one can almost smell and feel the gently blowing breezes of the frontier nation with an unmistak able flavor of the homesteading west filtering through. but then suddenly one is jolted askew by a stuffy argument on whether vermont or massachusetts has produced more dis tinguished men (rossiter 191 1; woods 191 l) each state claimed victory, but really who cares! back in the east, as would be expected, the articles focused on issues of an es tablishment, but still of course on the urban developments of a century ago, when, for instance, roads were being paved not for cars, but for bicycles. there are dozens of papers on immigrants, from where they came and into what parts of the country they settled, and of their impact. starting with work of holmes ( 1 890), mortgage statistics were featured often, as farmers and bankers tried to reconcile records with what was clearly a new phenomenon. the crucial role of railways is reflected by an appropri dysentry, cholera, scarlet fever, whooping cough, measles, and so on all were pervasive and persistent. there was a heated debate on the relevance of and the effect of age co horts on the analysis of cancer incidence; but sadly, the ba sic underlying tenet was that the observed increase in cases was not real and that it was only an apparent increase due to the way the data were grouped, as argued by, for example, king and newsholme (1893) and by winslow (1901), with willcox’s (1917) article telling the story in its title, “on the alleged hcrease of ancer ” tied in with this work on diseases was the attendant issue of birth and death rates. hoffman (1906) studied death rates from the perspective of improving health and sanitary con ditions. he was the first to suggest that death rates should be determined with respect to age, genderrace, occupa tion, and other factors. in an article that lays out plenty to digest even today regarding social policies, willcox (1916) observed that a decline in death rates over the previous 2o years with the previous 8o to loo years co incided with a decrease in fluctuations, and likewise for birth rates. appeal to the englishmen farr, galton, and karl and winslow 1900). those who have worked in these ar eas know, however, that mathematically this is not an easy problem. the census folk also wrestled with these ques tions, though their focus was a concern with ascertaining population trends. well, the aforementioned were application areas that re ceived much attention. numerous other areas received at tention as well. we could spend some time looking at anthropology, government budgets (as in “the growing dis parity between and expenditures (of the public [ford 1899]), churches and religions, suicide, trim [ ]892] imprinted on my mind for his delightful insight that large number of entries statistics on freight, mileage, passengers, revenues and expenses, and so on (see, e.g., tury came a realization that perhaps there were too many railway accidents, so doten (1905) collected data and made recommendations as to how to reduce the potential for acci dents. ten years later, counterpart warnings were issued for the future potential

many of these inal statistics (including an entertaining entry by pettigrove of working conditions for the day (see chaddock 1912; h a &gout of the shock of controversy the spark of truth”), ris

and indeed, the emergence of demography as a discipline was so on. quite evident in the journals of the day. this then is the story essentially up to about 1920. sur concurrently, there was an ormous body of work dealprisingly, there was no appreciable change in the landscape ing with diseases, again emanating from a concern for through the 1920s and 1930s. correlation or its associated working conditions and also living conditions, that led inentities dominated the mathematical publications. there evitably to what we refer to today as environmental conwere articles coping with the difficulties of calculating the terns. for example, chaddock (1914) demonstrated that the correlation coefficient and/or deviations, a task deemed so death rate for tuberculosis for the entire population of a daunting that many workers still shied away from it. thus city obscured a higher death rate for persons in certain secwe see, for example, the following set of articles tions of the city that had poor sanitation or bad housing conditions or for persons working in dangerous occupa tions under inadequate conditions, thus leading to remedies for better housing and workplace environments. for anyone desirous of tracing this story, there are data in plentitude. tuberculosis, pneumonia, influenza, diarrhea, typhoid fever, “an automatic correlation calculating machine” (hull 1925) “an apparatus to assist in the calculation of the stan dard deviation of a grouped frequency distribution” “apparatus to facilitate the calculation of the mo ments of a distribution” (jenkins 1928) “the use of machine factoring in multiple correla tion” (brandt 1928). another set of papers dealt with time series. most of these appeared in the 1920s, and most dealt with seasonality is sues, essentially developing the embryonic concepts ges tated by the persons (1917) work mentioned earlier. unbelievably (to me at least), there were very few entries on analysis of variance and/or tests of significance during the 1920s and 1930s, despite the fact that these topics were clearly at the forefront of theoretical statistical develop ments at that time. the following list is of interest not only because it includes the first jasa article by the well known name but also because it includes the first substantial article on the topic highlighted therein: “a test of significance for the correlation coefficient” (e. pearson 1931) “errors of the second kind in testing ‘student’s’ hy pothesis” (neyman and tokarska 1936) “analysis of variance as an effective method of han dling the time element in certain economics statis tics” (schultz and snedecor 1933) “the use of analysis of variance in enumeration by sampling” (cochran 1939) “the analysis of covariance” (bailey 193 1). snedecor’s article, investigating the geographical distri bution of prices paid to swine producers in iowa, reflected the continued dominance of articles for their economic per spectives. note that sir ronald fisher did not publish in jasa until after 1939, though all of the design articles used his statistical methods for research workers as a starting point. to these articles, we add the following: “a general mathematical theory of depreciation” (hotelling 1925) “the use of ranks to avoid the assumption of nor mality implicit in the analysis of variance” (friedman 1937). these are mentioned for their historical value as each au thor’s first jasa entry, though friedman’s article was also the first nonparametric method (that i could find). for all the importance of these mathematical advances, they were still few and far between. the asa’s interests, as reflected by jasa entries, were those of the practicing statistician using statistical tools to elicit a truth for the higher goal of addressing society’s needs in some funda mental way. the only real shift over our first 100 years was that by 1939 there were fewer reports (of vital statis tics, etc.) from overseas. we were still economists, histori ans, sociologists, political scientists, and census takers, with a smattering of mathematical statisticians. because the asa was founded by men concerned with the census process, we would be remiss if we neglected to mention at least some highlights from its nineteenth century history. by the mid 1800s indeed by 1839, the year that the asa was founded the importance of statisticians and statistical science in the arts of administration was emerg ing. this was particularly evident because the census was still being “taken practically with the antiquated and inef fective machinary provided in 1790,” our first census, as lunt (1888) in his historical account described it. indeed, lunt sets out a compelling catalogue of intrigue of the cen sus schedule as it evolved over its first 100 years. the most significant advances were not to become reality, however, until general walker, over a 20 30 year period starting with the 1870 census, laid down essential and long lasting princi ples of official statistics, declaring that “whoever adheres to them will meet with success, whoever neglects them com mits a crime” (wright 1897). also, there were numerous unheeded calls for a permanent census office, a call finally answered in 1902, with the asa being a major player in that successful legislation. much of the historical literature discussed prevailing opinion about the kinds of information that should be in cluded in the census count, with a subsequent reporting after a census of what these figures were and what they meant. however, some papers dealt with difficulties associ ated with ascertaining the counts themselves. we mention two briefly. one dealt with unregistered deaths. price (1907) started “like the celebrated recipe for cooking rabbits, in order to deal with unregistered deaths, the unregistered deaths must first be found.” he then went on to suggest two possible methods of finding these unregistered deaths, namely, the census plan of comparing enumerator returns with death records, or a plan founded on scouring newspa pers for death notices; neither plan was satisfactory. indeed, it was the asa together with the medical asso ciation who first made the call in 1847 for a standard death certificate. to those who have struggled with the undercount question in recent years, this problem has an uncomfortably familar ring. the other difficulty that drew attention was holmes’s (1890) proposal to develop a sampling plan (in this case, to ascertain mortgage statistics) that would be “represen tative” and conducted “systematically.” holmes provided a long discussion of how, when, and what questions can or cannot be asked, with the warning that to those unacquainted with statistical experiences and the psycholog ical difficulties to be overcome, nothing seems easier than to print one to twenty questions.. place [them] in the hand of a numerator and send him from house to house for answers. thus we see the beginnings of surveys. it was not until 1915 that gillin (1915) called for the asa to set up a stand ing committee on surveys and statistics to establish stan dards and guidelines for the survey instrument. no commit tee report or recommendations could be found, but hobson (1916) did provide an excellent theoretical framework for such instruments. another thread intricately tied to the census was the de velopment of what was usually referred to as “mechanical devices”; that is, machines to assist in the enumeration and compilation process. the hollerith electric tabulating ma chine was developed for and first used in the eleventh census. porter s superintendent of the eleventh census, reported there were 100 machines with 100 clerks each handling 1 mil lion cards per day. porter also provided a discussion of the types of nonstatistical errors encountered and their impact. his proposal to address the issue of recording errors was to compare the schedule with 25 50 cards selected at ran dom. if the europeans were leading the way in mathemati cal theoretical developments, according to knight (191 51, it was the s who “practically preempted the field” in tabulating, counting, and adding machines, unquestionably spurred on by the demands of the census process. in con trast, at that time europe was ahead in the development of computing machines, most notably the brunsviga and mil lionaire machines (most familiar to us from pearson and fisher photographs). because this is the centenary year of the washington sta tistical society (wss), it is perhaps appropriate to pause a moment to reflect on that occasion and its impact then and now. we recall that the asa had been founded in boston, primarily as a local association, with the purpose of providing “purely statistical information.” in addressing the wss on its inauguration and noting that the ameri can people were, in his words, “intensely and passionately devoted to statistics,” asa’s president walker (of census fame) lamented the fact that as a nation we collected vast quantities of statistics (i.e., numbers, counts, data) at consid erable expense (walker 1897). further, in making a striking analogy with the relatively substantial funds readily avail able to train men in preparation for military duties, walker emphatically urged that the nation should be supporting the analysis of such data and the training of statisticians to do such analyses if we were not going to waste this expenditure from the national budget. the asa had recognized the im portance of a close relationship between the makers of the statistics (i.e., the government statistician) in washington and consumers throughout the land, thereby prompting the establishment of the wss. thus members were exhorted to “promot[e] the discussion of statistical methods, statisti cal results, and statistical principles” among the local body (i.e., the government). although walker had plenty of advice and impatient urg ings for those in the wss, his words ring true for statisti cians anywhere and in any enterprise. his opinion that it is desirable that the persons who are to use statistics and every writer of history, economics, or sociology must use statistics should be taught to observe the limitation necessarily imposed upon the validity and authority of the figures they use, and be encouraged by association, by correspon dence, and by acquaintance, through a body like the statistical association, to confer together (walker 1897) is as applicable today as it was in 1896. walker was a giant in the 1800s. he was so because he passionately believed in the power of the statistical method and he advocated its use vigorously, to “save from mak ing great errors of judgement and sometimes monstrous errors in their conclusions.” to borrow from syndicated columnist george will (1989), “history is the history of the mind, and great events invariably are beads on a thin, strong thread of ideas”; walker was one of those beads. the statistical machinary may have changed, and perhaps the arsenal of tools has multiplied a thousandfold, but his principles are still beacons calling across the waves. before closing, it behooves us, i believe, to ponder deeply walker’s ethos, as it applies to our own historical future. today, where do we stand? are we standing on the river bank looking downstream at what has already gone be fore us, or are we straining our eyes upstream with hope ful and excited anticipation at what the future will bring? are we restlessly poised readying ourselves to grasp the new world coming? if we gaze only downstream, we will rapidly disappear into oblivion, for the world is changing around us at a mind boggling rate. we are historical cogs privileged to live in the electronic revolution equivalent of the printing press revolution (of 500 years ago) and the in dustrial revolution (of 200 years ago) simultaneously. one aspect of this the “information superhighway” has al ready brought great changes to our daily working lives. we have adjusted to email, the world wide web, and ftp’s (file transfer protocols) at a pace that we would have been hard pressed to believe even 5 years ago. there are, of course, vast changes still awaiting us and treacherous shoals to navi gate, but it would be fair to say that most of us today believe that these challenges and their successive technical devel opments will be met even if we ourselves have only to em brace them. this is, however, the easy part, somewhat akin to the introduction of the hollerith machine in the 1890s or the monroe calculating machines of the 1960s. these are but contemporary vehicles for executing established prac tices in a new way. thus today we exchange information as email messages or manuscript volumes by electronic ex press as we head into the next century instead of the pony express of the last century; likewise, statistical packages ease the computational burden of some statistical analyses. the much more difficult challenges deal with the sub stance of our profession what we do, those whom we impact, and our educational enterprises. it was not by co incidence that i earlier quoted koren’s 1914 presidential address. on that occasion, on our 75th anniversary, the discipline stood on a threshold, a door opening wide to the radicalization of the approach to our game. we speak of the then impending explosive developments of what be came the mathematical statistical method. we all know the discoveries that ensued following the march through that door. today, some 80 years later, it is easy to see that we too are in the throes of another explosion, one intricately tied to technology and electronic capabilities. in a period of shrinking budgets and diminishing resources, we so often hear that we need more time and more money. however, i believe that the greatest challenges today are not lack of time and money, but rather organizational and conceptual challenges challenges centered on the substance of our discipline. the organizational issues can be compared with devel opments surrounding the frequency distributions a century ago. information and data are being generated at a bewil dering pace satellite data, health care data in its myriad forms, government statistics, environmental data, meterological data, genetic information, experimental data gener ated from computer hookups, and so on. interpreting some of these data will involve the redevelopment of “known” techniques necessitated by the sheer size of the problem at hand. more generally, the challenge is that we do not know how to organize or even how to access most of the data, let alone how to interpret it. conceptual problems involve new ways of thinking, new ways of approaching our art. these will require research in new methodologies that never could have been conceived or could have emerged without the computational power and capability of the computer itself. recent new developments in imaging, bootstrap, and so on, are but the vanguard, in much the same way as correlation opened the door to math ematical developments. as we take on these challenges, it is essential that we remember why we are doing so. in this context we have a client a client who is primarily a social scientist, a biol ogist, an engineer, a government agency, a pharmaceutical company, detroit, an educator, or another nonstatistician and it is our responsibility to foster useful and appropriate statistical analyses to shed light on worthwhile scientific problems. in another echo from our past, ayres in his pres idential address, asserted that (the new statistics) should (not) continue to be obscured by cryptic math ematical symbolism and abridged complexities of verbiage involving in ferential leaps in the dark. our dilemma (and ayres’s words are still relevant) lies between the recondite treatment of the difficult problems on the one hand, and the means of communicating the results intelligibly on the other. that was in 1926; and today we dismiss ayres’s words of caution at our peril; ayres (1927). to quote ayres again, our science should not be a collection of greek letters [to which we add computer imaging, e.g.1 that are incomprehensible to the uninitiated, but a source of deep satisfaction to those of the inner cult. (ayres 1927). instead, we must dismantle the shroud of mystery that threatens to engulf our new statistics. it is equally true that our educational programs are in dire need of reexamination. too often our graduate programs are a 1990s version of the same programs being offered for the last 40 years, fine tuned to add new topics and with the computer doing what was previously done by calcula tors and “times tables” before that. traditionally, we have trained our graduates in our own image to go into (aca demic) jobs that no longer exist. employment opportuni ties in nonacademic sectors are beckoning enticingly. if we do not prepare our students adequately, then these oppor tunities will be quickly taken up by nonstatistical experts. therefore, to prepare our future graduates, we must make radical changes in our thinking. certainly, some fundamen tals must be mastered, but it is not necessary to master in 5 years an entire field that developed over a 100 year period. instead, programs should be structured to build a platform that stimulates creativity and teaches the essential skill of how to garner and how to use information, a platform that provides the basic skills and mechanisms and a training for a life long versatility that will be essential for the twenty first century. perhaps the greater challenge is with our introductory service statistics courses offered to non statistics majors. wright (1908), in the first asa presidential address, chal lenged those who thought statistics were as “dry bones,” by joining with north in asserting that there is nothing dry about them, that they are moist, juicy, fragrant as all the ‘perfumes of arabia.’ they are more poetic than poetry, more artistic than art, more musical than music, more philosophical than philosophy. when most students who take these courses claim to “hate” them, we are clearly doing something wrong. yet for years we have persisted with basically the same syllabus, starting with descriptive statistics with the aim of reaching the two sample t test with a pooled variance, or minor variations thereof. the valiant efforts of the few dedicated instruc tors who have labored mightily to dress up the course in various contemporary guises are transitory and have made hardly a dent, however much their efforts are applauded. it would seem that we need an entirely different approach, one that instills in the student an appreciation of statistics (as the juicy morsels, poetry, art, music, and philosophy of north’s refrain). this is especially true for those who take this course as part of their basic core curriculum. rather than an introduction to a few specific methods, what we need is a course on “statistics in society.” a course that is remembered by students as a “great” course will have a much more lasting and positive influence on how our sub ject is viewed. we are one of the few specialized disciplines privileged to have the opportunity to educate the nation’s future leaders and future lawmakers through the core gen eral studies program. we have squandered this opportunity in past decades. the responsibility is ours to redress this situation. statistics as a discipline cannot exist by itself. yet, with obvious exceptions of course, many of us as individuals and certainly as an association have of late withdrawn within ourselves. we must ask, “are we addressing the needs of audiences that seek us out?”; “are we even connected to these audiences?’ what constituted good statistical practice occupied the minds of our nineteenth century members. yet to read our journals today, serious questions about our des tiny jump out not from what is published, but rather from what is not published. history has amply demonstrated that great empires, and cultures, that have drawn within them selves have found that their power and influence quickly ebbed away. with apologies to playwright elmer rice (“the adding machine,” 1923), we ask, “are we counting ma chines?’ or, “can we count?” however, the question should not be “can we count?,” but rather “do we count?’ do pub lic servants, government officials, industrial managers, sci entists of all persuasions, and others immediately embrace the statistical method as an integral thread in the fabric of their own enterprises and decision making ventures, or have we become isolated and irrelevant? if we do not adjust to the new realities, we will be discounted and discarded just as mr. zero, the moribund accountant in rice’s play, was ignominiously dismissed for his failure to adapt to his new environment. thus we need to muster our intellectual energies and abil ities, to refocus our mental telescopes as we seek our des tiny and a future that will be productive and fitting for the inevitable societal problems that cross our paths. we live in turbulent times, with the established boundaries of how we go about our art crumbling before us. new paradigms, not only of our subject matter, but also of our relation ships across government, industry, and academia and of collaborations with other disciplines, must be developed. we are many parts just as an orchestra comprises many instruments. whether we jar as a cacophonous clatter or harmonize together as a beautiful (beethoven) symphony is our choice. we are setting out across uncharted territories, in much the same way as abraham, columbus, the pilgrims, and captain cook before us set out for distant lands and new opportunities. our past sparkles with the deeds of great men and brilliant achievements. the present and future are full of promise. this is an exciting time to live. it is up to us as an association to chart a course that focuses on the unique strengths inherent to statistics and its boundless opportunities to play pivotal and indispensible roles in re solving contemporary issues, a course that guarantees the success of our profession and of statistical science. “do we count?’, we like to think we do. the crucial question is: “do others think that we count?’ that answer and our response to it will fashion our future. thank you.",338,23.7041420118343,4.95893659510734,0.300424363454818,8012,2407,18.1352194784746,13.1352194784746,7,0.516994568928662,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1997.10473597"

Kettenring","1970-1999","﻿we've used as a theme for this year's meeting, shaping statistics for success in the 21st century, and that is also the title of my talk tonight. many of the sessions at this meeting are devoted to different perspectives on our future. all along my hope has been that the sum of all of these perspectives (e.g., see eddy et al. 1998) would help to give us a clearer view of the future and point our compasses in the right direction. how in fact are we doing? how prepared are we for the future? as i was thinking about my own answers to these questions i was searching for a metaphor that would convey to you how 1 feel. 1 think i found it! my metaphor is in the form of a story about a friend who awakened abruptly one night while in the middle of a deep sleep. he sat up in bed breaking out in a cold sweat. all this fuss awakened his wife who asked him ""what in the world is going on?"" my friend, now dripping in cold sweat, mumbled ""i think i'm dead."" his wife looked at him in amazement and asked ""how do you know?"" he thought for a moment and answered ""nothing hurts!"" nothing hurts. well, by that standard, 1 think we can say that statistics is alive and healthy! i think you know what 1 mean. it's an ironical situation. the need for statistical thinking has never been greater. we're surrounded by massive data challenges that cry out for improved statistical methods and algorithms. we have a host of interdisciplinary challenges to pursue. no group is in a better position to crack open the challenges of the information age than we are. the importance of our field is reflected in the nearly 40% rise in elementary statistics course enrollments between 1990 and 1995. and now we have an advanced placement or ap exam in statistics, which is a striking acknowledgment of the central role of statistics in our lives. (dick schaeffer reports that around 7,000 exams were graded this year, many more than expected, and that twice that number are forecasted for 1997 98.) at the same time, statistics seems to be struggling. are these the natural evolutionary struggles that will help us to evolve into a stronger discipline? or are they dividing us unnecessarily and sapping our strength at a time when we can hardly afford it? 1 don't have the answers. but 1 do know that many of you share my concerns that, looking ahead, our continued success is far from guaranteed. the purpose of my talk with you tonight is to discuss a few of the dimensions of these concerns and opportunities and to suggest some priorities that we can work on together. image reconstruction i put at the top of the list our image or, more precisely, image reconstruction. as scientists, we tend to concentrate on our technical work without much regard for how others see us. unfortunately, our image our public statistical persona haunts and harms us. the standard stereotypes of statistics as a dull and impenetrable subject and of a statistician as a numbers nerd are pervasive and unfair. 1 sometimes wonder if there is any other science that is so seriously misunderstood and narrowly pigeon holed as statistics. the difficulties start early when students shy away from study of statistics or put their feet in the water and are quickly turned off by what they see as statistical mumbo jumbo. as youthful perceptions mature, we are hit by a battery of prejudices that again reflect ignorance or misunderstanding of our problem solving capability. to give you a typical example, recently asa was invited to participate in a government sponsored discussion of privacy issues involving databases. we were happy to do so and were ably represented by john gardenier. after the meeting john reflected on the other attendees and wondered why we (asa) had been grouped with sports statistics people, dun and bradstreet and other commercial companies. in fact there had been a second group composed of the physical society, nsf, aaas, noaa, etc. apparently the organizers did not appreciate that statistics is a science! it reminded me once again of the w. h. auden limerick, ""thou shall not sit with statisticians nor commit a social science."" what can we do to burnish our image? well, lots of things really. but let me focus on one thought: we need to devote more energy to communicating effectively with the public. we need more of our own versions of the late carl sagan who did so much to popularize science. in the words of stephen jay gould (gould 1997), ""great scientists have always produced the greatest popularizations, without compromising the integrity of subject or author."" a few statistical sagans could help us immensely! but, just as important, we all need to pitch in to tell the story of statistics in ways that non experts can understand and appreciate what we have to offer. communication with the public at large, in language they can understand, is a challenge for all of us. we can look to our elected leaders, our senior statesmen, the asa office, and our office of scientific and public affairs (ospa) advisory committee to set the tone, but improvement on the scale that is required will only come if we all make this a priority. looking ahead, image reconstruction must be one of our top priorities. it must be understood that statistics is the data science of the 21st century essential for the proper running of government, central to decision making in industry, and a core component of modern curricula at all levels of education. i would like to see asa make image reconstruction a part of its strategic plan. and i suspect we may need some professional help if we are to succeed. outreach and advocacy closely related to our need for image reconstruction is the opportunity for increased outreach and advocacy. let me illustrate with four examples. the first example involves our ability to respond rapidly to important issues involving statistics. today if an issue of critical national concern involving statistics were to arrive at our door, an issue that requires immediate attention, we are not really well equipped to respond. this situation has been of concern to the asa board of directors. we want to be in a position to respond thoughtfully and quickly and to involve appropriate experts in a timely fashion. as a second example, earlier this year asa was encouraged to establish a mechanism to provide ongoing advice and council to federal agencies on fundamental matters of economic statistics. under the leadership of the ospa committee, we are exploring exactly how such a mechanism should be established. the current debate over the role of sampling in the next census is a third example. i am proud of the proactive role we took through our blue ribbon panel as well as the contributions of other statisticians to the debate on this politically charged topic. fourth example. recently we joined forces with other societies to advocate the need for strong federal support for science research. we were cosponsors of a full page ad which appeared in roll call, a congressional newspaper. we need to weigh such opportunities carefully but we also need to be more aggressive and proactive than perhaps we have been historically as advocates for science and advocates for statistics. here i am thinking of the words of mary woolley as expressed in a recent science magazine editorial (woolley 1997). she pointed out that ""lobbying work in washington is absolutely essential for the future of science; and every scientist should be contributing through his or her professional associations, to responsible representation of the interests of science in the nation's capital."" while the focus on washington is natural, she goes on to point out that local public outreach and advocacy activities are equally important. looking ahead, it is hard for me to envisage a successful future for us without extensive grass roots commitment to and involvement in outreach and advocacy. as an association and as individuals we must find effective ways to get involved. resources must be committed. outreach and advocacy need to be major components of our strategic plan. human resources i'd like to talk for a minute about our human resources. how are we doing in attracting talent to the field? what are we doing with that talent? in terms of attracting students to the field, i get a very mixed picture as i talk with different statistics departments. some appear to be doing just fine. but others are seeing a sharp drop in quality applicants to the point that one might question the viability of such departments if the trend is not reversed very soon. one bright spot appears to be the number of women entering graduate school in statistics. women constitute from one third to one half of the population in many cases, and the numbers are especially strong in departments which provide an applied focus such as biostatistics or industrial statistics. as i look across the landscape of asa, i see women playing key roles in virtually every corner of the association: as president and vice president, as editor of jasa, as chair of the joint program committee for this meeting, as board members, as council and committee chairs, as chapter presidents, and as movers and shakers in the widest sense. having said this, however, there are other aspects of our human resource utilization that are not nearly so gratifying to talk about. within asa we have a demographic profile that is rich with diversity of all kinds. let me just say that we can and should do a better job of reflecting this diversity in all of our activities. one opportunity that i would like to see us grab a hold of is the idea of a senior service of statisticians. fritz scheuren described the opportunity in these words: ""asa needs to find a way to set up a wide area network for statisticians whose workplace associations are irregular. without this, too much talent, knowledge, and wisdom will be lost. there is so much work to do."" sig amster, who is now retired after working more than 35 years at bell labs expanded on this idea: there seems to be a great opportunity for asa to advance the current push for ""volunteerism"" by finding matches for retirees with valuable experience and local, state and federal governments with such needs. i believe there are many retirees, including myself, who do not wish to ""pound the pavements"" looking for this type of work. if asa could be the catalyst to bring the two parties together, there should be much positive publicity for the organization and much benefit to the participants. looking ahead, i believe we can do a much better job of attracting talented people into the field and then fully utilizing that talent in all of our activities throughout their professional careers and even into retirement. international relations an intriguing feature of our demographic profile is the fact that about 10% of our members reside outside the united states. in recognition of the importance of our international constituency, we have a dedicated position on the board of directors for an international representative. we also have a committee on international relations in statistics. its charge is to ""...foster activities involving international communications, exchange, and joint development with professional statisticians, societies, and other organizations in countries throughout the world."" our high quality publications are a magnet for members internationally. our newest journal, the journal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics, is a joint publication of asa and the international biometric society. our statistical magazine, chance, a joint venture with springer, is designed for general audiences, and we hope it will become a truly international magazine. indeed, its editor, george styan, lives in canada and his editorial board includes members from finland and new zealand. one of the most exciting developments at asa during the past year has been our web site. asa's web site can be accessed in principle as easily from moscow or sydney as it can from alexandria or anaheim. it offers a tremendous opportunity for international outreach and communication. 1231 in fact we have some early indicators of this from our web site statistics. let's take a look at the statistics for a roughly 100 day period starting in mid march. during this period we received over 900,000 requests for information. while the majority were naturally from the u.s., requests came from over 80 other countries around the world. the leading ones were, in order, canada, the united kingdom, germany, australia, france, and austria; but what was even more intriguing to me was the variety of others in a very long tailed distribution paraguay, croatia, china, norway, just to name a few of the others. overall, more than 11% of the traffic is international, which is about the same as the percentage of international members. i speculate that this is the tip of the iceberg for us. as the amount of valuable information on our web site increases, we should see a correspondingly strong growth in interest from the international community. i think we have an excellent foundation in place for strengthening our international ties and building closer working relationships with statistical societies world wide. but we could be doing more. after all, asa is by far the largest national or international society devoted to statistics. we're three times larger than the royal statistical society; three and one half times larger than the national statistical society of china; and nine times larger than the international statistical institute itself. we can take some pride in these numbers. however, we also need to share our success with others and cultivate effective international partnerships. looking ahead, i believe asa should sharpen its international focus by building upon its foundation of rock solid local and national activities and expanding its ties around the world. now i'd like to switch gears a bit and talk about three dimensions concerning the subject matter of statistics itself. holistic statistics the core of statistics has gradually evolved and strength"" ened during the 20th century. the mainstream statistics journals, such as jasa, have documented these developments very successfully. and our statistics departments have built their programs around these core topics with very little variation. the question i wish to raise is whether the 21st century statistics discipline should be equated so strongly to the traditional core topics and activities as they are now. personally i prefer a more inclusive interpretation of statistics that reflects its strong interdisciplinary character. the issue is similar to what we hear in other domains of science. it reflects the tension between narrowly focused pursuit of science versus approaches that are more holistic, emphasize synthesis, and encourage interdisciplinarity. for example, a recent article about the future of physics argues for a broadened base of research, unusually flexible tenure evaluations, and increased interdisciplinary interactions (gruner, langer, nelson, and vogel 1995). 1232 eric chaisson (1997) put it this way in his description of nasa's new science vision: to make this new program really work, scientists especially will need to become more broad minded and less specialized to be willing to explore (or at least tolerate some of their colleagues exploring) holistic world views systematically and synergistically, not merely undertake the reductionistic science that has been so heavily supported by funding agencies for decades and just as myopically honored by our colleges and universities. the scientific community will have to welcome synthesis as well as specialization, teaching as well as research, dissemination as well as discovery. there is no doubt in my mind that we must work hard to preserve a strong statistics core. however, i believe the best way to do this is by surrounding it with vigorous areas of application that will nourish the core with fundamental challenges and receive in return a variety of new approaches and methodologies. the inclusive view suggests broad minded statisticians who are not as committed to narrow specialties. instead, they see the world at large, including the world of statistics, holistically and do ""not merely undertake reductionistic science."" rather, they are skilled at looking across boundaries and operating in fast paced environments. they know how to solve real problems and have genuine impact. perhaps it is even possible to have it both ways. i think adrian raftery described the potential very nicely in a note he sent me earlier this year: statisticians can work in many areas of science, while gaining a deep knowledge of aspects of their own discipline. in a world of increasing specialization, they can combine the scope of generalists with the skills of specialists. this combination is rare and in great demand, as well as providing a lifetime of exciting and fulfilling work. looking ahead, i believe that an inclusive interpretation of statistics, and all that that implies for training, research, and careers is the way we should define our field for tomorrow. new foundations i've been talking about a broad vision and definition of statistics. another question is what shape the core of statistics will take and, in particular, what the fundamental underpinnings of statistics will be in the years ahead. i believe the time has come for us to acknowledge that computer science needs to take its place alongside mathematics (and probability) as fundamental linch pins of statistics and as disciplines that undergird our research and instruction. examples of relevant topics in computer (and computing) science include databases and database management, algorithm design, computational statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. it is mainly for this reason that i invited al aho to be the guest speaker in this year's president's invited speaker session to symbolize the growing importance of computer science to statistics and to encourage us to think about the need for increased interactions between our fields. i believe this is the first time that a computer scientist has filled this role. in fact, it is pretty unusual just to have a computer scientist involved in our meetings! in addition to making selected computer science topics a part of the core training for future statisticians, i see many interdisciplinary opportunities as well. let me highlight two opportunities that sit at the intersection of computer science and statistics. first, i'll mention the area of software engineering. this relatively young branch of engineering has emerged as one of the critical activities of the information age. quoting from a report of the national research council's (1996a) committee on applied and theoretical statistics, entitled statistical software engineering, the development and the production of high quality, reliable, complex computer software have become critical issues in the enormous worldwide computer technology market. the capability to efficiently engineer computer software development and production processes is central to the future economic strength, competitiveness, and national security of the united states. the report then goes on to detail a variety of areas where statisticians and software engineers could work together productively. one of the larger challenges is statistical control of the software development process where one can envisage the sort of ""demingesque"" progress in software manufacturing that has been achieved in more traditional hardware manufacturing. the second area is the current hot topic of data mining, which statisticians might reasonably think of as data analysis of very large databases. in fact, if you dig down and look at what is involved in data mining, you will find a variety of statistical components, such as statistical graphics and cluster analysis. moreover, there is a great opportunity to bring a variety of statistical concepts to bear modeling, sampling, robust estimation, outlier detection, dimensionality reduction, etc. nevertheless, there are new opportunities as well, and we would be wise to pay very close attention and to become seriously involved with these developments. in fact, if we don't, there is risk that we will be blown away by the momentum that is flowing in this direction. as jerry friedman pointed out in his keynote address at interface '97, we are no longer the only game in town. many other data oriented sciences are competing with us for customers and students. also it should not go unnoticed speaking of image reconstruction! that the very term, data mining, has captured the fancy of many people, especially in the business community. it is grabbing headlines that statisticians would kill for. the image of data mining is that something powerful is going on there. the reality? well that may be rather different. it may even turn out that the phrase of the day in the 21st century is lies, damned lies, and data mining. but for now i believe we should take advantage of the momentum before it fades into another missed opportunity for statistics. looking ahead, the 21st century curriculum for graduate statistics training needs to be centered around aspects of computer science as much as it is today around mathematics. the needs of the computer science and statistics communities are now lightly intersected. let's strengthen them in ways that advantage both communities. ketlenring: presidential address data trends the discussion of data mining leads naturally into my next topic, trends in statistical data problems. trends in the types of data challenges we are facing now are excellent leading indicators of the shape that statistics will take in the early years of the 21st century. let me just focus for the moment on the size of these problems. somewhat surprisingly, one trend seems to be towards smaller problems. in industry, competitive pressures are so strong, time horizons so short, and data often so expensive to collect, that we are forced into uncomfortable situations where plans and decisions need to be made based on less and less data. but the real pressure, of course, is towards increasingly large problems and statisticians, being well schooled in variability, have a tendency to encourage things in this direction. moreover, in many areas of application we are seeing really unbelievable amounts of data; e.g., • gigabytes of telephone network traffic • terabytes of data on global climate change. but sheer size is not the real issue. it is the combination of size and complexity that is the challenge. these so called massive data problems (national research council 1996b) are often not amendable to standard statistics solutions. while statisticians have only begun to grapple with the challenges of massive data sets, some potentially valuable approaches are already emerging such as; • adaptive sampling (learning as you go) • guided visualization (pan and zoom) • reliance on approximations (forget optimality) • distributed work (people, machines) • divide and conquer (consolidate later) • exploit the context (the ""zeroth problem""). colin mallows' fisher lecture is all about the ""zeroth problem"" (mallows 1997). references related to peter huber's special lecture on statistics and massive data sets are also worth singling out. (huber 1997a,b). looking ahead i see challenges at both ends of the data size spectrum. however, the high end massive ones, to paraphrase john tucker of the national research council, offer the grand challenge to statistics for the 21st century. infrastructure the last dimension that i want to talk about is our infrastructure. like any serious activity, we in statistics have our own vital needs for a strong infrastructure. i'd like to comment briefly on three of these elements. first, niss the national institute of statistical sciences. i find it a bit embarrassing, frankly speaking, that we have yet to pull together as a community behind niss. afterall, this organization was created by the national professional statistical community, including asa, to ""promote, develop and perform cross disciplinary research in problems of national and international importance."" if niss does not ultimately flourish in one form or another, it will 1233 be an ugly black mark on our profession and a major setback for an element of our infrastructure that is very much needed for our future. another element of our infrastructure that is worrisome is the health of some of our academic statistics departments. the department of statistics at the university of rochester shut its doors on june 30. sixty miles to the west, the statistics department at suny buffalo is in a real crisis. its heading towards a merger with another department and a dramatically reduced role in the process. at the same time, 100 miles to the southeast of buffalo, several separate statistics groups at cornell university are being consolidated into a new department of statistics. and earlier this year, after a long gestation period, a new department was formed at the university of pittsburgh. many other long lived departments are so well cemented into the fabric of the university that their demise would be literally unthinkable. perhaps we can learn from them the paths to success. you can read more about this in the julyaugust issue of amstat news under the heading of the birth, life, and death of statistics departments. to round out the discussion of infrastructure, let me tum to the central asa office. the office is located in a fourstory building on duke street in alexandria, va, close to washington, dc. it is our administrative hub for everything from publications to dues collection. it is no secret that we have hadto struggle with a range of serious problems in the asa office over the last few years and are still a long ways from a state of office optimality. the problems have included fiscal shortfalls, turnover of key personnel, and computer software difficulties. while we have been addressing these back office problems, we are also placing increased emphasis on member services and customer care. during 1997, we initiated a quality management mode of operation which reflects the best of the spirit of w. edwards deming. i hope that the asa officecan now proceed quietly along its own path towards excellence of operation and that you will notice the difference. i'd like to thank nick fisher, our international representative on the asa board, and david marker and david morganstein of westat for helping to facilitate our quality management efforts. looking ahead, our vision for the 21st century must start with an efficient and effective infrastructure across the board. regarding asa i'd hope for the day when the asa office is recognized as the standard of excellence among its peers. a tight ship. fiscally strong. responsive and innovative. caring of its customers. a focal point of statistical outreach to the world at large. likewise we must strengthen the other elements of our infrastructure because we of necessity depend on them for support and progress. conclusion in this talk, at this meeting, and throughout 1997, i have been trying to focus our attention on what we need to do to position our association and profession for success in the years ahead. 1234 this is not an idle exercise. our position today is not terrific. we might heed the words of satchel paige, that long time wily and wise pitcher: don't look back. something might be gaining on you. for us that something is at our doorstep. but we're not yet in agreement that we have a problem or what the problem really is. while we ponder and debate, opportunitiessadly eontinue to pass us by. we need some closure on these discussions. even if we're partly wrong, which we surely will be, let's get our act together and make a plan for the future. another important philosopher, yogi berra, counseled: you've got to be careful if you don't know where you are going, because you might not get there. our vision needs to be multidimensional. our image requires extensive reconstruction. we absolutely must increase our outreach and advocacy activities. we ought to better utilize our own human resources. we should bolster our international ties and increase our impact there. we need to take on an expanded, inclusive interpretation of statistics that better reflects the holistic nature of the field and the wealth of ways it can contribute to the well being of society. we need to adjust the fundamental underpinnings of statistics to include a strong role for computer science as part of the foundation of our field. we ought to deal head on with the challenges of massive data sets. (i believe this will force us to rethink much of our current statistical practice.) and, finally, the critical supporting infrastructure of statistics needs to be shaped for the 21st century. without it we won't make it. 1 hope when you leave anaheim you will have a better sense of exactly how you can and will help. discussions are continuing. other dimensions are being explored. let us keep talking and moving ahead. as the great inventor, charles f. kettering, explained it: we should all be concerned about the future because we have to spend the rest of our lives there.",260,18.6461538461538,4.94100660066007,0.303011551155116,4848,1469,16.0784933993399,11.0784933993399,49,1.39897193796783,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1997.10473641"

Moore","1970-1999","the liberal arts are usually understood to be general and flexible modes of reasoning. by this definition, statistics qualifies as a liberal art, and it is important to the health of the discipline that it be recognized as such. the liberal arts that is now dominant has alternated with an ""oratorical"" tradition that also gives insight, into ideas of evolutionary psychology."" this paper considers how understanding statistics as a liberal art influences our appreciation of the discipline and especially our teaching of beginners. introduction in pondering what i might say on this occasion, i sought wisdom from my friends, including bob hogg. bob suggested that no one would notice if i simply repeated his address of a decade ago (hogg 1989). in fact, i am going to return to one of the most common themes of past presidential addresses, though from a somewhat different perspective. asa presidents have repeatedly urged us to broaden our understanding of the field of statistics and the work of statisticians. last year, jon kettenring (1997) called for ""a more inclusive interpretation of statistics"" and used the nice phrase ""holistic statistics."" don marquardt (1987) urged us to take ""a wider view of ourselves."" barbara bailar (1988) and janetnorwood (1990), who have much to say about statistics as a guide to policy, stress the need to interact with those who use data to make decisions, and vincent barabba (1991) said much the same thing from an industrial perspective. most of these leaders naturally focused on the concerns of professional statisticians and the needs and prospects of the profession. i have in mind a less. professional audience: the students who sit before us in the only statistics course they will ever endure. the numbers are large. the last cbms survey found that 115,000 students took an elementary statistics course during the fall semester in college mathematics and statistics departments. this number increased by 38% between 1990 and 1995. in 1998, only the second year in which the exam was offered, more than 16,000 students took the advanced placement statistics exam, doubling the count for the previous year. if we add the rest of the academic year and the large numbers who meet statistics outside mathematics and statistics departments, ""hundreds of thousands"" seems a safe characterization of the masses who each year pass through a first course in statistics. for most of these students, their first course is their one and only formal exposure to statistics. we can hope that an intellectually stimulating introduction will attract bright people to our profession, but that is not my present concern. how we introduce statistics to beginners is both our best opportunity for public relations and one of our most serious public responsibilities. all the groups whose attention we seek eeos, senators, news correspondents sit before us in a still plastic state. what we offer them does or does not equip them to think about data, variation, and chance. it forms or deforms the image of statistics that they will carry with them permanently. the image i would like to form is that statistics is one of the liberal arts, that we offer broad and flexible modes of reasoning that make smart people smarter in every aspect of life and work. this is no trivial matter for statisticians, whether or not they ever teach beginners. the failure of statistics to achieve wide recognition as an independent field is the most serious problem facing our discipline. gerry hahn and roger hoerl (1998) describe the current environment in industry as ""statistics without statisticians,"" and much the same is true in academia. when ""performing a statistical analysis is no longer a marketable task anyone with a laptop can do that,"" what do statisticians have to offer the medical researcher or psychologist or engineer? that is the practical form of the question whether statistics is in fact a separate and fundamental discipline. hahn and hoerl give the answer in a slogan that should be a motto for introductory instruction: ""shift from statistical methods to statistical thinking."" the theme of the 1998 joint statistical meetings was ""statistics: a guide to policy."" that statistics is so often a guide to policy is testimony to the unusual prevalence of statistical issues in policy discussions. it is easy to think of policy questions to which (say) chemistry is relevant, and also easy to think of issues to which chemistry has nothing to contribute. i find it hard to think of policy questions, at 'least in domestic policy, that have no statistical component. the reason is of course that reasoning about data, variation, and chance is a flexible and broadly applicable mode of thinking. that is just what we most often mean by a liberal art. thinking of statistics as a liberal art has immediate implications for teaching, which even those who teach goal oriented colleagues in industry might ponder. we too often ignore broad ideas in our rush to convey technical content. we spend too much time calculating and too little time discussing. in short, we are too narrow. i am going to reflect a bit on the nature of the liberal arts and about what placing statistics among the liberal arts says about the nature of statistics. to do this, i will first look at what the liberal arts have traditionally 'meant, under the intriguing title ""orators and philosophers."" then at what they might mean in a contemporary perspective based on speculation about ""how the mind works."" at each step i will make brief comments on how we look at our discipline, but i am not going to expand at length on these implications, for teaching or otherwise. i prefer to let you use your imagination to do your own expansion (and seek the elusive balance: we do have technical content to teach). orators and philosophers i characterized the liberal arts as ""flexible and broadly applicable modes of thinking."" scientists, at least, tend to accept this characterization without much reflection. to quote a cognitive psychologist (pinker 1997, p. 333), the liberal arts ""are intellectual tools that can be applied in any realm."" in fact, two quite different basic conceptions have alternated and combined in complex ways. the nature of these conceptions is nicely caught in the title of bruce kimball's book, orators and philosophers (kimball 1995). both traditions originate in classical antiquity: think of socrates and cicero as their embodiments. the philosophers, like socrates, are seekers after truth. in the philosophical tradition, the liberal arts encourage skeptical, analytical thinking, unconstrained by a priori standards. any conclusions are subject to continuing challenge. methods, not conclusions, are the core of liberal knowledge. adherents of this tradition ""search for a precise, rational method of pursuing knowledge, and tend to regard mathematics, logic, and natural science"" as the heart of the liberal arts (kimball 1995, p. xi). david hume (quoted by kimball, p. 125) put it bluntly: when we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? if we take in our hand any volume, of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? no. does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? no. commit it then to the flames; for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. the orators have quite different emphases. they think that the liberal arts equip free citizens to lead society. they are not, like the philosophers, essentially individualistic; the public good is never far from their thoughts. they believe that there are known truths and fixed standards of personal and civic virtue described in a body of canonical texts. therefore, ""the task of liberal education is to inform the student about the virtues rather than, as the socratic tradition held, to teach the student how to search for them"". the educational emphases of the oratorical tradition are nicely caught by the title of e. d. hirsch's bestselling cultural literacy: what every needs to know. as the hirsch reference suggests, the oratorical tradition now has a distinct ""culturally conservative"" ring. the philosophers have, for now, captured most educated opinion. yet it would be a mistake to dismiss the orators. the two traditions have alternated in being generally accepted. in roughest form, the history goes like this. the pragmatic romans adhered to the oratorical tradition, as did the early middle ages. scholasticism and the rediscovery of aristotle brought the philosophers to the front in the high middle ages. renaissance and reformation sought truth in classical models and in study of the bible and the fathers, restoring the orators to dominance. the enlightenment was emphatically on the philosophical side, as hume's blast suggests; but in the 19th century, education continued to stress the preparation of gentlemen by classical studies. it was only with the rise of research universities and the acceptance of scientific research as an intellectual paradigm that the philosophical interpretation of the liberal arts as generally applicable intellectual methods came to be seen as obviously true. philosophers and statisticians i take it for granted that statisticians (though often not others) can see at once how statistics fits into the philosophical tradition of the liberal arts. statistics is a general intellectual method that applies wherever data, variation, and chance appear. it is a fundamental method because data, variation, and chance are omnipresent in modem life. it is an independent discipline with its own core ideas rather than, for example, a branch of mathematics. i have argued this last point at length. for comments emphasizing teaching and aimed at mathematicians. although i leave to your imagination the full argument that statistics offers general, fundamental, and independent ways of thinking, i must at least hint that the argument has an empirical component. both statisticians (show me data) and liberally educated people (courtesy of freud and marx) are wary of arguments from principle. here is some empirical evidence that statistical reasoning is a distinct intellectual skill. nisbett, fong, lehman, and cheng (1987) gave a test of everyday, plain language reasoning about data and chance to a group of graduate students from several disciplines at the beginning of their studies and again after two years. initial differences among the disciplines were small. two years of psychology, with statistics required, increased scores by almost 70%, while studying chemistry helped not at all. law students showed an improvement of around 10%, and medical students slightly more than 20%. the study of chemistry or law may train the mind, but does not strengthen its statistical component. both the past and the present are of course messier than kimball's dichotomy suggests. in the renaissance and the nineteenth century, for example, distinct philosophical elements mixed with the prevailing oratorical tradition. similarly, the contemporary victory of the philosophers is not complete. to give an example relevant to teaching statistics, the school mathematics curriculum in the united states has been steadfastly ""oratorical."" students are asked to learn facts and techniques and to drill endlessly on their immediate application. reformers would like a more philosophical tone that emphasizes flexible ability to formulate and attack open ended problems, and the influential standards of the national council of teachers of mathematics (1989) reflected the reform position. as states began to adopt reform minded standards, a backlash set in that at least in california is aptly described as ""the math wars."" traditionalists claim that the new curricula undermine students' ability to calculate automatically and shorten the list of mathematical facts that they know. reformers claim that traditionalists want to train students merely to compete with calculators on the calculators' home turf. [civil comments from both sides appear in wu (1997) and kilpatrick (1997).] statisticians have an interest in this conflict of traditions because teaching data analysis as a core strand in school math is part of the reform program. working with data gives a context to mathematical exercises that would otherwise be abstract and is a rich setting for problem solving and group work. the ""philosophical"" orientation of the movement to reform school mathematics fits the nature of contemporary statistics. it reflects at an appropriately lower level of sophistication our emphases on exploring data, scientific inference, and collaboration with other disciplines. an aside: francis bacon, thomas bayes, and john tukey speaking of philosophy: when i mentioned the title of this talk to bill cleveland, asking about perception, he made this comment: ""another connection with the liberal arts is philosophy. there is, of course, much philosophical thought about learning from experience, that is, inductive inference. it is relevant to the foundations of statistics."" he cited some bayesian literature. i am not embarrassed to have ignored this aspect of my topic. like most statisticians, i remain eclectic, respecting bayesian approaches as sometimes useful but unconvinced by claims of universal hegemony based on first principles. the other papers and discussion in that collection debate the place of bayesian ideas in introducing beginners to statistical thinking. this discussion is directly relevant to planning the ""one and only"" statistics course, but i don't wish to revisit the controversy here. i will note that both bayesians and data analysts, in quite different ways, claim to have an operational approach to the thorny problem of inductive inference. both consider background information, data analysts by an intuitive sensitivity to context and bayesians by a mathematical model. paul velleman (1997) cleverly shows how closely john tukey's guiding strategies for data analysis parallel francis bacon's seminal thinking about induction as scientific method. his extensive selection of aphorisms from tukey summarizes, in my opinion, statisticians' best thinking on inductive reasoning. the recurring sections titled ""visualization and probabilistic inference"" in cleveland (1993) suggest that he prefers intuitive inductive reasoning of the tukey variety to more precise but less comprehensive mathematical formulations of induction. intuition and formalism have obvious relative strengths and weaknesses. (once again, use your imagination.) for our present 1255 purpose, we can consider bayesian ideas as firmly in the philosophical tradition of the liberal arts, and data analysis as having affinities with the orators in ways that i will now describe. orators and statisticians statistical thinking fits neatly into the philosophers' paradigm. yet statistics considered as a liberal art also shares aspects of the oratorical tradition. exactly because data, variation, and chance are so widely present in modem societies, statistical thinking has the same ""preparation for citizenship"" value that training in public speaking had in cicero's rome. it is also true that statistics is best taught and learned in ways that mirror the older pattern. one of the most important principles for teaching statistics is the value of good examples. working with data is an art as well as a science. we learn it not simply by mastering formal methods but by following examples set by our current teachers and by past masters. in this, learning statistics is like learning to perform music, another subject in which students develop practical wisdom and critical evaluation through context and example. musicians play bach, and statisticians reexamine classic data sets posed by masters. we return, for example, to fisher's iris data, and sometimes (as in cleveland 1993, pp. 298 301) improve on the master's work. most of us have met the ""stack loss"" data, apparently first discussed by brownlee (1965) and rendered canonical by the lengthy analysis in daniel and wood (1971). the ""motorcycle crash test"" data (e.g., hardle 1990) are attaining the same canonical status in nonparametric regression. we learn in this way because technique alone does not make an outstanding statistician any more than an outstanding musician. interpretation in the specific context is always important. so is what colin mallows in his fisher lecture (mallows 1998) called the zeroth problem: ""considering the relevance of the observed data, and other data that might be observed, to the substantive problem."" even settling the substantive problem is not always the end of the matter. the impetus for the theme ""statistics: a guide to policy"" was a remark of fred mosteller in an interview in the first issue of the journal of statistics education: usually people think (and many statisticians tend to think) that once good data are available, then the answer to the policy question is at hand. but that usually is not true, because policy implies politics, and politics implies controversy, and the same data that some people use to support a policy are used by others to oppose it. so it's very difficult to handle policy questions, but nevertheless data do help the debate. the mention of politics recalls the oratorical tradition's emphasis on the public good. that tradition also stresses generally accepted standards. statisticians involved in policy issues or under pressure from funders or employers need standards as guides and as protection. i invite you to study the ""ethical guidelines for statistical practice"" prepared by asa's committee on professional ethics. these brief remarks make it clear that the philosophical tradition is incomplete. all real science has aspects of the oratorical tradition as well. but i suggest that statisticians. the linear pattern appears stronger in the lower plot because of the surrounding white space. eventually lead us back to those hundreds of thousands of students. an example: perceiving predators and perceiving graphs consider an example: perception. cognitive scientists have considered perception at length, partly because they would like to program robots better. attempts to program artificial perception have led to deep respect for the complexity and subtlety of the perceptual computations that we humans need never think about because we come equipped with them. steven pinker, from whom i borrowed the title ""how the mind works,"" gives a summary (1997, chap. 4). a camera, says pinker, records the world as it is. so photographs taken in low light display a reddish tinge. the human mind compensates, so that we see ""normal"" colors. the camera finds it hard to distinguish a snowball in a dim room from a lump of coal in sunlight, but the human mind analyzes subtle hints to make the distinction at once. we need no formal training to ""see"" three dimensions when we process the two dimensional images on our retinas. we are good at perception because perceiving the predator in the brush helped our ancestors stay alive. how good are we at reading graphs? because graphs are the most effective way to present data, statisticians are interested in our' perception of data graphics. cleveland (1985, chap. 4) distinguishes our immediate perception of patterns, which is made ""effortlessly and almost instantaneously"" and varies little among individuals, from the complex cognitive task of interpreting these patterns, which is presumably a learned skill. our innate perceptual algorithms are not designed to decode data graphics, for the obvious reason that there were none on the savanna. judging the strength of a linear relationship from a scatterplot seems less subtle than pinker's description of the coal snowball problem, yet we are easily misled by so simple a change as increasing the white space around the scatterplot. see figure 1 and, for a careful study, cleveland, diaconis, and mcgill (1982).. we need no formal study to distinguish coal from snowballs in almost any light. we do need to learn to decode data graphics. cleveland and others study how to make graphs that better fit our perceptual apparatus, and teachers of basic statistics know that students are no more born able to read graphs than to read words. that even quite basic statistical reasoning must be learned is part of the nature of the liberal arts as civilized arts. statistical thinking is unnatural what is true of perception is also true of conceptual thinking: our thought processes are shaped by an environment very different from those we now inhabit, so that we are subject to illusions that can be overcome only by targeted learning. many statisticians can testify from experience that intellectually sophisticated people are not automatically adept at statistical thinking. reading statistical graphs is elementary compared with thinking about probability and causality. the oratorical tradition insists that the liberal arts are civilized ways of thinking that prepare citizens to participate in society. none of these arts are much help when you are lost and hungry or confronting an armed man intent on doing you harm. perhaps the currently fashionable topic of evolutionary psychology can help us understand this. the mind, say the evolutionary psychologists, is a collection of organs of computation, organs adapted for reproductive success in the african savannas in which we humans spent most of our evolutionary history. as edward o. wilson puts it ""the brain is a machine assembled to survive."" wilson notes that cognitive neuroscience is in its ""heroic"" or ""romantic"" period, which i take to mean that its ideas are tentative and speculative. nonetheless, they are intriguing. this view of mind suggests that the liberal arts are those modes of reasoning needed in civilized society that are not innate because they had no survival value on the savanna. i like this formulation. it is a more specific form of the prevailing philosophical definition that draws some insight from the orators, and it emphasizes that these ways of thinking must be learned. this will stand out we worry about context, interpretation, and policy implications more regularly and more intensely than do chemists and mathematicians. we are perhaps either ""more liberal"" or ""more an art."" we are certainly, in kimball's sense, more oratorical. have made us all aware that intuitive probability often does not conform to the laws of mathematical probability. gilovich (1991) is an excellent and charming survey. velleman notes that francis bacon already remarked on the human tendency to construct an order that need not actually exist, so that science must constantly critique our natural thought processes. that critique in tum invites critical study. intuitive probability may often be inaccurate in our present environments, but it is intuitive for good reasons. responding to tversky and kahneman, other psychologists noted that long series of independent trials rarely occur outside the casino, and that intuitive probability often makes sense in less artificial environments. pinker gives an example that i will use to illustrate the fact that even the most basic aspects of ""statistical literacy"" require the regularity of a civilized environment. high on my list of elements of statistical thinking is the claim that data beat anecdotes. this is surely a learned principle, and one much neglected by public opinion. recently, a five year, $5 million epidemiological study concluded that there is no association between low level electromotive fields (i.e., living near power lines) and childhood leukemia (linet et al. 1997). the editorial in the new england journal of medicine that accompanied the study report (campion 1997) thundered that ""it is time to stop wasting our research resources"" on this question. compare the impact of this study with that of one television appearance by an articulate mother whose child has leukemia and who happens to live near a power line. the anecdote wins every time. we grit our teeth and try yet harder to convince our students of the virtues of data from well designed studies. ""data beat anecdotes"" is a good principle. but here is pinker's example, originally by gerd gigerenzer. you live in a village near a river where no crocodile attacks have occurred for years. you hear that a neighbor's child was eaten by a croc there this morning. would you let your child play in the water? pinker (1997, p. 351) concludes that, ""the person in the street who gives a recent anecdote greater weight than a ream of statistics is not necessarily being irrational."" my conclusion is a bit different. the anecdotes statisticians have in mind (the articulate mother on tv) have much less value as data than a body chewed by a crocodile, yet they easily sway our thinking. our minds are configured to give undue weight to anecdotes because of the crocodiles in our evolutionary history. compare the crocodile and the epidemiological study. it seems clear that the usefulness of statistical reasoning depends on regularities in the problem studied and on artificial regularities that we commonly create in designing data production. this is a matter of some subtlety. art dempster, in his 1998 fisher lecture, remarked that repetition is at the heart of these regularities, but this is not the whole story. that we statisticians have become comfortable with statistical reasoning does not make it more natural or less dependent on an environment to which evolution has not adapted 1257 us. how much we pass over, to our students' confusion, as we race through a first course. statistical thinking, statistical teaching statistical thinking is a general, fundamental, and independent mode of reasoning about data, variation, and chance. effective use of statistical reasoning requires considering the zeroth problem and interpretation of formal results in the context of a specific setting. statistical thinking is an artifact of civilization, not part of our natural neural equipment. it is learned in part from well chosen examples rather than entirely from general theorems. all this fits the description of statistics as a liberal art. all of it has implications for our teaching. none of it is new to thoughtful statisticians. we are doing better what may be news to many statisticians, especially nonacademics, is that we academics are doing better than in the past. compared with a generation ago, beginning instruction is now more likely to emphasize working with data, the design of data production, and the reasoning and limitations of formal inference. that is, current thinking in statistical education is consistent with the view of statistics as a liberal art. this is not because teachers have been persuaded by rhetoric. the pressures that changed our first courses are more concrete: technology has forced us to focus on what isn't automated, introductory instruction has gradually followed trends in research away from mathematics alone back to data and interdisciplinary work, and insights from research in education (see garfield 1995) have influenced our classroom behavior. whatever the driving forces, the result is teaching and learning that give more attention to big ideas and general strategies for dealing with data, variation, and chance. richard scheaffer, whom i am willing to take as an authority, ""with regard to the content of an introductory statistics course, statisticians are in closer agreement today than at any previous time in my career."" at a time when we must defend the independence and importance of our discipline, we are fortunate to have reached general agreement. compare the fractured state of historians a recent forum on teaching history shows very little agreement on the relative role of facts versus structures (orators vs. philosophers again) or anything else. you can see the elements of our agreement in a report (cobb 1992) in which asa's joint committee with the mathematical association of america lays down recommendations for any first course in statistics. a summary (fig. 2) has been adopted by the asa board of directors. that summary repays careful reading. note in particular its insistence that beginning instruction should present core statistical ideas (the importance of data, the omnipresence of variation, observation vs. experiment) that can rightly be described as broadly applicable intellectual tools. 1258 1. emphasize the following elements of statistical thinking a. the need for data, b. the importance of data production, c. the omnipresence of variability, d. the measuring and modeling of variability. 2. incorporate more data and concepts, fewer recipes and derivations. wherever possible, automate computations and graphics. an introductory course should a. rely heavily on real (not merely realistic) data; b. emphasize statistical concepts, e.g., causation vs. association, experimental vs. observational and longitudinal vs. cross sectional studies; c. rely on computers rather than computational recipes; d. treat formal derivations as secondary in importance. 3. foster active learning, through the following alternatives to lecturing: a. group problem solving and discussion: b. laboratory exercises; c. demonstrations based on class generated data; d. written and oral presentations; e. projects, either group or individual. figure 2. recommendations of the joint curriculum committee for first courses in statistics. don't stop here there is much to be said about how we can build statistical thinking in those hundreds of thousands of people who pass through a one and only statistics course or through the equivalent in corporate training. trusting again in your imagination, i will say just one big thing: we are still too narrow. our teaching has moved in the right direction. yet we still often take big ideas for granted in our rush to present technical material. we less often commit the mortal sin of omitting the distinction between observation and experiment. but venial sins remain. we give scant time to building by experience broader aspects of statistical reasoning such as these: data beat anecdotes. is this the right question? does the answer make sense? can you read a graph? do you have filters for quantitative nonsense? any thoughtful statistician can recall examples that demonstrate that though these are not technical issues, they are also not trivial. thinking of statistics as a liberal art helps us balance our essential technical expertise with the will to expand on it rather than be limited by it. a corollary is that the first course in statistics is not primarily intended to develop statisticians. i am not sure that this corollary is part of the consensus dick scheafer identifies. although we all agree on the move toward ""real data and reasoning about real problems"" in beginning instruction, it may be that ""developing tomorrow's statisticians"" remains the priority of some thoughtful people, even in a first course. indeed, i borrow that phrase. from a paper by rex bryce (1998), though i read him as primarily concerned with programs rather than with the one and only course. bryce and those whom he cites (box, hunter, marquardt, snee, etc.) urge the broadening of statistics programs to include preparation for employment in such areas as team, collaboration, and communications skills. hahn and hoed (1998) repeat the same message in describing what business and industry require of statisticians. they are surely right, and some of this fits new pedagogical techniques that are appropriate even in a first course. i remain convinced, however, that the one and only statistics course is too broad an opportunity (""hundreds of thousands"") to focus on primarily professional ends. so what? why does all this matter to the working statistician? because the future prosperity of our discipline depends on our willingness to take the broad view that ""statistics among the liberal arts"" suggests. the liberal arts image is deliberately non professional. i have chosen it in part to emphasize the importance of what we present when we teach the hundreds of thousands of students who pass through that one and only statistics course, but it has a wider message. we ask, for example, whether statistics will be overwhelmed by technology, so that we become a minor branch of information science. quite possibly, if we restrict ourselves to addressing only technical issues. if we are simply nerds, we are the wrong kind. the point of considering statistics as a liberal art is to remind ourselves that we need not be simply nerds. one of the clearest lessons from attempts to apply technology to teaching and learning (ehrmann 1995), and one that applies more generally, is this: if you use technology to simply carry the same old thing, you get the same old results. to get different results, you must add new thinking to new technology. the reason: technology empowers. but thinking enables. the liberal arts image emphasizes that statistics involves thinking. it is because statistics involves distinctive and powerful ways of thinking that we will not be swallowed up by information technology. the computing communication revolution presents everyone with very large masses of very disordered information. statistical thinking offers simple but non intuitive mental tools for trimming the mass, ordering the disorder, separating sense from nonsense, selecting the relevant few from the irrelevant many. what is more, any revolution implies that we face new problems. new problems require general and flexible modes of reasoning. as bob hogg put it in the address i did not replay, statistics is a guide to the unknown. statistics as a liberal art is in the longer run the most useful and most practical form our discipline takes.",308,17.5324675324675,5.13907407407407,0.295185185185185,5400,1594,16.5720697450697,11.5720697450697,38,1.00765632921087,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1998.10473786"

Ellenberg","1970-1999","statisticians are often not recognized at a level appropriate to their contributions. moreover, statistical methods of analysis may be receiving more recognition than statisticians themselves. this article considers several measures of the recognition of our profession and explores why recognition is important not only to the individual statistician, but also to the health and prosperity of our profession. the asa has now completed its annual awards ceremony, honoring significant career achievements of newly elected fellows and other honor awardees. this continues a time honored tradition of peer recognition of achievement of those deserving individuals within our profession. but what of the recognition received by statisticians outside the cloistered world of the asa? the honor awards ceremony, an inner directed celebration of our profession, provides fertile ground on which to develop my theme. the punctuation of the title “statisticians’ significance” is correct, although the title itself is purposely misleading. this is not a talk about statistical significance, but rather about the perceived significance or recognition of statisticians by others, both the lay public and other professionals. i chose this ambiguous title to test the integrity of the academic citation system. i want to ascertain, years from now, how many times this article has been blindly cited as pertinent to such issues as q: levels, multiple comparisons, and group sequential monitoring levels. no single mechanism or measure of significance appropriately recognizes the many important contributions made by statistical scientists to almost every aspect of daily life. and, generally speaking, recognition through high salary levels and deferential treatment in society has not been correlated with achievement in the statistical profession as they are for, say, physicians and attorneys. there are some notable exceptions, including w. edwards deming, who is reported to have inspired reverence equivalent to that of a deity among the japanese. nonetheless, there are other potential recognition centers, providing varying degrees of recognition, many of which i address in this article. 2. statisticians as contributors to policy i begin the discussion of the recognition of the value of statisticians as contributors to the public policy decision making process by posing a few rhetorical questions: i are statisticians, where quantitative input would be valuable, routinely asked to sit at the table during public policy debates? 2. or are statisticians asked to serve those at the table by providing technical support? 3. or are statisticians not even allowed in the room when policy issues are debated? the feasibility of providing quantitative answers to these questions is doubtful, so i provide some anecdotal evidence that the answers are not very favorable. 2.1 aids in an early report generated by the national commission on aids (national commission on aids 1992), the organization created by congress (national commission on acquired immune deficiency syndrome act 19881, major topics included the demographics of the aids epidemic and issues related to clinical trials of therapeutic agents. thus statistical thinking, not just technical input, was highly relevant to the policy recommendations. the chair and vice chair of the commission of 10 were physicians. two attorneys were included on the commission, but no statisticians. on examination of the commission’s report and the acknowledged contributors, it appears that statisticians were not even visible as “servers.” 2.2 census 2000 for the decennial census in the year 2000, statisticians are clearly at the table, but perhaps not the best table in the house (author’s emphasis added). the issue raising the ire of many is whether statistical sampling should be allowed in the decennial census to adjust for the expected undercount of people with disabilities, rural s, homeless people, and others expected to be missed disproportionately in the direct enumeration. article 1, section 2, of the u.s. constitution seems reasonably unambiguous on the issue of sampling: “the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the congress of the united states, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they [the congress] shall by law direct.” the constitution expressly delegates to congress the responsibility for deter mining the method of enumeration. thus both sampling and complete enumeration are constitutionally acceptable options. although one might argue the constitutionality of abusing this directive in a manner that disenfranchises groups of citizens, barring such cynical activity, the method of enumeration is up to congress. the arguments as to how to enumerate may go as far back in time as the first testament. for example, different translations of the original hebrew text of numbers 1:2 given in figure 1 relating to the first census of the israelites may provoke divisiveness. one translation of the hebrew text is taken from a 1956 source (hertz 1956): take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of numes [emphasis added], every male by their the census referred to here was not conducted to apportion seats in the israeli parliament, but rather to calculate the strength of the army, as measured by the number of men available to bear arms. if one can get past the unenlightened biblical view of a military force, it is important to note that this translation deems it acceptable to enumerate just the number of names. a second translation (the jewish publication society of america 1962) of the same passage is given as: polls. take a census of the whole israelite community by the clans of its ancestral houses, listing the names [emphasis added], every male, head by head.” this translation is considerably more restrictive, requiring an actual listing of names clearly a constriction less amenable to the use of sampling. i must assume that the democratic side of the aisle is seeking their spiritual guidance on this issue from the 1956 translation and that the republican side of the aisle is looking to the 1962 translation. of course, these references to a higher authority may not be directly relevant. the israelites did not at the time of the scriptures have an imbalance in undercount as we have in the united states today, as they were technically all homeless. many statistical issues relating to the usefulness of sampling on the one hand and the validity of sampling on the other hand have been superficially and vocally debated on both sides of the aisle. the profession was and is “at the table” but is being selectively utilized to support predeter mined agendas. despite reports from the nonpartisan national academy of sciences (edmonston and schultze 1995; white and rust 1996, 1997) and the asa ( statistical association 1996), this debate, as captured by the press, may on balance have exacerbated an image of the statistical profession as purveyors of chicanery. 3. the public image of statisticians the press influences the public’s perception of statisticians. and, to quote an oft used phrase, “perception is reality.” at the 1996 joint statistical meetings in chicago, the good news was that the joint statistical meetings made the front page of the chicago tribune. this was also the bad news given that the headline read “statisticians take calculated risk trying to shed nerd [emphasis added] image.” how are statisticians generally portrayed in the popular press? using the new york times web site search engine, we searched for the words “statistician” and “statisticians” in most of the new york times feature sections. the yield for a recent period was 46 sentences. seven raters were enlisted from various fields to give their perception of how each sentence portrayed the statistician’s image. each sentence was scored on a scale of 1 4 , with a derogatory image at the low end and positive image at the high end. typical sentences retrieved are given below, trichotomized by a well validated algorithm derived from the classic 1996 western movie “the good, the bad, and the ugly” ranging from a clearly “good” perception: the expert panel 16 aids specialists and statisticians was convened by the institute last spring to determine whether steroids would be effective in treating the pneumonia (kolata 1990) to a “bad” perception: china claims economic growth last years of almost 8 percent a tribute to the government’s $1.2 trillion stimulus plan and probably to the audacity of the statisticians (kristof and wudunn 1999) to the “ugly” perception that statisticians are somehow responsible for the faults of the world: the yeltsin government began its long overdue fight against tax evasion by arresting the nation’s top statisticians and accusing them of manipulating data to help russian companies avoid taxes (gordon 1998). using arbitrary cutpoints of 2 and 3, i trichotomized the raters’ mean scores for the 46 sentences into the categories of negative, neutral, and positive, as shown in table 1. the results of this informal search review may seem somewhat comforting in that about half of the sentences were considered neutral by the panel, with the remaining half split between negative and positive. however, before we become complacent about the implications of these observations, we need to remember that these results are conditioned on statisticians being mentioned at all. i assessed the frequency of reference to statisticians relative to other professions by again electronically searching the new york times feature sections, this time for refer ences to 10 other professions. i used recent bureau of labor statistics figures for total numbers employed in each of the professions compared (us. bureau of labor statistics 1998; us. bureau of the census 1997). the total number of citations for the 11 professions examined was approximately 20,000. the frequency of citations for each profession is shown in table 2, along with the frequency of persons employed in each profession in 1966. the time period for the citations covers more than 1 year, so comparisons of per capita rates of citations among the professions provides only a rough, albeit illuminating, measure of the frequency with which our profession is mentioned relative to our share of the labor pool examined. the ratio of frequency of citations to the number employed is shown in descending order in the table’s fourth column. using this measure, statisticians rank well behind lawyers, economists, architects, and physicians. without extending the envelope of appropriate generalization from this single search, these results provide evidence of a particularly low frequency of reference (both in absolute terms and relative to our numbers) to the statistical profession in the reporting on issues and events. moreover, other professions are mentioned far in excess of their proportion of the labor pool. one might postulate from these results that, despite our concrete successes in so many areas, recognition in the public press has not been forthcoming. table 2. references to selected professions in the new york times feature sections produced by the new york times first search data base 1996 total frequency of employed relative profession recent citation9 (1,000) frequency 4. statistics as a career a recent publication of the jobs rated almanac (krantz 1999) gives insight into how a career counseling expert views our profession as a career choice. the job description of a statistician is given rather concisely, and not very attractively, in the almanac as “tabulates, analyzes, and interprets the numeric results of experiments and surveys.” the almanac looks at five different criteria for each of 250 jobs. the 250 jobs are ranked within each of the criteria from 1 (highest) to 250 (lowest). figure 2 shows that statisticians rank number one for environmental quality of life. this criterion relates to both physical environment, such as air quality, and emotional environment, such as “peril” to life and limb. our profession appears to have placed us in a protective bubble. for physical demands, we are also number one, reflecting, according to the author, the sedentary nature of our work. this seems to me not an inspiring accolade. our ranking on job outlook relating to employment, salary, and promotion potential is fairly poor, close to the bottom quarter, and in the categories of job security and job income we fall in the middle range. what do some other professions look like when subjected to the author’s algorithm? for job outlook, statisticians were in the midrange, with the military, computer, and religious callings ranking very high. in this category, the president of the united states and other lawmakers ranked at the very bottom. in the environment category, our mathematical and computer scientist colleagues join us at the top rank, with the president, along with race car drivers and firefighters, doing rather poorly. 5. collegial recognition how do our co workers relate to us as professionals? are we considered consultants or collaborators? technicians or colleagues? 5.1 authorship one of a few reasonably objective ways to assess the answers to the questions just posed is to examine authorship lawyers economists architects physicians statisticians psychologists dentists teachers engineers accountants computer programmers a the new york times first search data base coverage includes “international, national, business and new york regional news as well as sciences, medicine, arts, sports, and lifestyle news:’ the database is not a complete compendium of all articles published within any time period searched, and different search strategies could provide different results. the time period covered is not specifically defined but should reflect primarily recent publications. employment numbers in each profession compiled from the us. bureau of labor statistics 1996 figures (us. bureau of the census 1997) and the 1998 99 edition of the occupational outlook handbook (u.s. bureau of labor statistics 1998). 1 1 environment income outlook physical security demands in those arenas where statisticians’ work leads to scientific publications. my assessment on this issue is necessarily limited to the field of medicine. i would like to assess whether statisticians receive authorship credit appropriate to their contributions, as judged by generally accepted standards. one can dichotomize the question and ask whether any authorship credit is received and, if it is, whether the level of authorship is appropriate. whereas the former question is not easy to assess other than anecdotally, my own experience has been that in the field of medicine, receipt of authorship by statisticians is by no means routine and is very institutionally dependent. often statisticians are only “acknowledged.” if authorship credit is received, then do statisticians receive an appropriate level? level of authorship is often one of the most difficult issues raised in a collaborative relationship, at times competing with the study design itself in terms of attention. seniority, length of the relationship of the collaborative team, and institutional tradition are only some of the factors involved in decisions on this issue. to gain some insight into the issue of level of author ship, i searched the medical literature over the past 10 years, looking at the authorship levels of 27 statistical authors. the 27 authors were purposely chosen in a fairly biased manner. because i was searching a database of several million papers, i needed to restrict the list to low frequency names to ensure infrequent matches with the names of nonstatisticians. names were also selected so that i could be reasonably aware of the areas in which the statisticians were working, to minimize the potential for misclassification on review of the abstracts. the search produced 176 collaborative articles from substantive medical journals, specifically excluding those in journals such as statistics in medicine and biornetrics. the distribution of the authorship placement is more favorable than i had anticipated. approximately 35% of the articles reviewed had the statistician listed in the first or second authorship slot (table 3). the importance of the last position is ambiguous. it can be considered the highest position when the most senior person on the team occupies it coupled with a junior person as first author, it can be the lowest position if the authors are not listed in alphabetical order, or it can have no implications for authorship status if all authors are listed alphabetically. 5.2 importance of authorship earning authorship credit in a collaborative project is extremely important. in medicine, many collaborative clinical projects last for years and may take up a major portion of legitimate “on record” contribution in the form of authorship can be detrimental to one’s career. the level of authorship is widely viewed as a measure of one’s contribution. the new england journal of medicine has developed an algorithm that probably reflects the way reviewers evaluate resumes for promotion or new positions. in the table of contents on the journal’s cover, if there are more than three authors for an article, only the first author is named. the results of this algorithm are seen in the july 30, 1998 issue of the new england journal of medicine. the authors of the first two listed “original articles,” c. confavreux and k. g. saag, had 4 and 11 coauthors, respectively. only the two first author’s names were shown, resulting in authorship lines of “c. canfavreux and others” and “k. g. saag and others.” one wonders how the other 15 coauthors feel about being classified as “others” after spending years on these projects, and how their sponsoring organizations feel about not having their representative listed on the front cover of the new england journal of medicine. the new england journal of medicine also has an algorithm for including author names in citations listed in the references section at the end of each article. their citation rule allows for only a limited number of authors; everyone else is “et al.” authorship and authorship level are a real and tangible currency for the recognition of collaborative efforts. notwithstanding a statistician’s legitimate claim to author ship, whether it is granted and the level of authorship when granted will, to a large degree, depend on the collaborative team’s perception of that contribution. there is a recent move toward requiring those named in the acknowledgement section of an article, a distant second place to author ship, to give written permission for such acknowledgement. this sign off requirement may force awareness of the importance of a statistician’s contribution. 6. academic recognition what is the standing of statistical science in academia? as a surrogate measure of the recognition of statistical science in the academic setting, i reviewed the 1998 edition of asa’s annual compilation of “schools offering degrees in statistics” ( statistical association 1998). we were interested in where statistical faculty are located organizationally. within 305 university departments containing statistical faculty, only a third of the faculty were located in what might be considered primarily departments of statistics (table 4). another 29% were primarily in joint departments of mathematics and statistics. the final third were mostly housed in departments of mathematics. although i cannot speak from direct experience concerning the implications of locating statistical science faculty in a free standing entity, conversations with my academic colleagues provided a range of views. among these views were the following: joint departments generally give statistical science the short end of the stick. sophisticated, are increasingly used in many fields. analytic methodology considered sophisticated 20 years ago is now, through repeated use in applications, considered routine. my thesis is that our analytic methodology may have attained a higher level of recognition than we have as the purveyors of that methodology. further, and perhaps more important, our analytic methodology has probably achieved a higher level of integration into the thought processes of those with whom we collaborate than have our principles of statistical design. i again go to the field of medicine to provide evidence for the increased recognition of statistical analysis methods as an integral part of research. 7.1 recognition of statistical methodology the addition of statistics to a mathematics department title may represent either a begrudging or a heartfelt recognition of our field. the promotion process for statisticians may depend on the goodwill and understanding of our field on the part of mathematicians. amidst the current trend of consolidation in academia, the statistical component may actually be the stronger part of a joint department. my own experience in the federal government has been that organizational independence is an important factor in the development of programs from the standpoint of resources, visibility, and other less quantifiable support. academia has done fairly well in recognizing the achievements of statisticians, as measured by a sampling of honorary degrees awarded from two leading universities presented in table 5. the university of chicago has honored many eminent statisticians over a long period. steve steigler (1999) has offered, somewhat tongue in cheek, that the department of statistics at the university of chicago considers r. a. fisher's honorary degree in 1952 to be the first doctoral degree that they awarded. harvard university enhanced a somewhat shorter list with 1999's honor to professor sir david cox. 7. recognition of statistical methodology i would like to turn now to the recognition of the utility and importance of statistical methods. there is no question that statistical methods of analysis, both straightforward table 5. university honorary degrees awarded to statisticians university of chicago harvard university maurice s. barlett david blackwell bradley efron david r. cox r. a. fisher ulf grenander frederick a. mosteller harold hotelling janet l. norwood erich l. lehman frederick a. mosteller jerzy neyman charles m. stein w. edwards deming as an indicator of the importance the collaborative project team placed on the statistical methodology used in their study, i looked for specific mentions of the statistical methodology in the title of articles presenting the results of medical research. the list of methods included analytical tools used widely in medical research, such as cox regression, repeated measures, and the like. i reviewed the past 20 years of the medical literature using a medical literature search engine of the medlineb data base (medline 1999), searching articles in medical journals to examine the frequency with which statistical techniques were mentioned in the titles of the articles. statistical journals, such as bio metrics and statistics in medicine, were excluded from the search. figure 3 shows the results of the search. the x axis gives the 5 year periods examined and shows the increasing mil lions of papers in the medlineb database over time. this increase prompted me to show a rate per 100,000 titles rather than the absolute number of medical article titles mentioning statistical methodology. the rate per 100,000 titles has increased steadily over the years. although small in number relative to the millions of articles written, these figures support an argument that statistical methodology, if not necessarily statisticians, is increasingly being accorded appropriate recognition. rate per 700,000 articles in which statistical method was specified in title, by time. x axis shows 5 year time intervals and millions of medical papers in the data base during each time period. 7.2 risk of familiarity with and ease of access to statistical methodology there is a risk that familiarity with statistical methods and the availability of user friendly computer software may create the impression that professional statisticians can be bypassed. certainly, tax preparation software has created a cadre of do it yourself accountants. similarly, legal soft ware has offered the opportunity for ordinary citizens to create legal documents, as exemplified by legal programs offering to create a last will and testament with a modest size set of branched questions. for example, with quicken family lawyertm (parsons technology 1996), the user making a will is asked a series of personal questions, such as “do you wish to specify who died first, if the willmaker and the spouse die simultaneously?” and “is the spouse included in the will?’ in response to certain answers, the program may prompt the user to consult an attorney. a caution flag flashes if the user attempts to modify any of the wording in the text of the will. once the questions are answered, the software pro duces a will. the software cannot completely codify the theory, experience, and ramifications that would be provided by a competent attorney, however, and serious errors could be made while producing a binding legal document with a slick look of correctness. this is all obviously a lead in to a discussion of the situation of statistical methodology. myriad software packages are available to assist statisticians in both the clerical computations and the interactive thinking involved in design and analysis. statistical software has made an amazing contribution. analogizing to the legal example, however, this same software is also available, as it should be, to nonstatisticians. as a very simple example, it used to be somewhat tedious to produce power computations and sample size estimates using different assumptions or design options. these can now be produced by software, following a sequence of questions similar to the legal paradigm. this allows knowledgeable statisticians to consider a wide range of design options by changing a few entry codes. in a power and sample size program, the user is asked to provide input on certain parameters whose implications are well understood by persons appropriately trained in statistical methodology. with the input, the program can provide a power computation and an easy to read and informative power curve or table. all of these computations can be easily modified to examine different scenarios. the next stage in one program that i reviewed (power and precision tm 1997) is both interesting and alarming. writ ten text follows the production of the power and sample size tables, similar to the will produced by the legal pro gram. only part of the automated text generated is shown here due to space limitations. italicized text indicates the parameters specific to the hypothetical problem submitted to the software algorithm: power for a test of the null hypothesis one goal of the proposed study is to test the null hypothesis that the proportion positive is identical in the two populations. the criterion for significance (alpha) has been set at 0.05. the test is 2 tailed, which means that an effect in either direction will be interpreted. with the proposed sample size of 100 and 100 for the two groups, the study will have power of 87.6% to yield a statistically significant result. this computation assumes that the difference in proportions is 0.20 (specifically, 0.40 versus 0.20). this effect was selected as the smallest effect that would be important to detect, in the sense that any smaller effect would not be of clinical or substantive significance. it is also assumed that this effect size is reasonable, in the sense that an effect of this magnitude could be anticipated in this field of research. what is alarming is that a person not trained in statistics can, in the design phase of a project, submit a few parameters and receive a power computation along with a complete text for submission. the text will sound intelligent and have the same aura of correctness as the legal document addressed previously. this particular program provides text only for power considerations, but knowing the inventiveness and competitive ness of software developers, the time cannot be far away when analysis computations will be followed by such text. thus, on submission of a dataset and response to structured questions, out will pop an analysis report. this does not seem to be an advance that we should eagerly anticipate. i used to sigh when i received telephone calls from col leagues requesting some of my time to “just compute a sample size.” they did not want to discuss the design or goals of the experiment in any great detail, just wanted me to pro vide a number for a grant proposal. with design software accessible to all, those calls have stopped, and i now see them differently, more as missed opportunities for develop ing true collaboration. with the availability of sophisticated analysis software, it is very likely that similar opportunities are being lost, at the same time as the potential for inappropriate use of the statistical analysis techniques by scientists not properly trained in statistics has grown. i raise several questions: are we at a point where our statistical methodology is well known and accessible to those in need of it, while the need for the professional statistician is actually somewhat diminished? how is it that a user can run statistical software and feel fairly certain that all of the bases have been covered, but mistrust the completeness and accuracy of a legal software package? is there a perception that what we do is standard and can be scripted, coded, and produced without professional statistical input? is the world more intimidated by the intricacies and formulations of the legal code than by the formulaic algorithms perpetrated in the name of statistical science? why can lawyers make us feel that the results may be disastrous if we play “harry homeowner,” whereas statisticians have been unable to create such a fear? perhaps the answers lie in the perceived lower potential loss associated with a statistical error than with a legal error. (actually, i am not sure of the equivalent of (y and p in the legal arena.) 8. conclusions this address is about the recognition of the importance of statisticians and statistical science by the lay public and other professionals. recognition is important not only at the individual level, but also at the level of the profession. without proper recognition of statisticians, we simply will not come to mind when policy boards are created, we will be shortchanged when scarce resources are divided, and we will be considered replaceable when salary levels are negotiated. in short, if we are not reasonably well recognized, then we will be invisible. 8.1 report card so, how well are we being recognized (figure 4)? based on the information just presented and some additional considerations, i would suggest that, as a profession we get an “n,” or “need improvement,” in the area of contributions to policy. the recent appointment of matthew goldstein, a mathematical statistician, as chancellor of the city university of new york indicates, as do many other examples, that my generalizations this evening can be rebutted with specific counterexamples. nonetheless, i, for one, would like to see such high level appointments become routine rather then the exception. we are also in need of improvement in our public image. statistics seems to be an attractive career, as judged by the somewhat anecdotal information presented tonight and by the fact that the number of doctoral graduates in statistics continues to increase, while the number of doctorates in the other physical and life sciences has leveled off. (henderson, clarke, and woods 1998). we are somewhat less than satisfactorily recognized in our collaborative efforts and by our nonstatistical colleagues in academia. finally, we get high grades for our methodology, which is recognized and appreciated. areas for improvement have been longstanding and will not be responsive to a quick fix. we can work to change our visibility and our image at both the individual and professional society level. at the individual level, we need to communicate our importance to our colleagues by promoting the worth of our input. the use of statistical jargon will not instill the same feeling of respect, or perhaps fear, engendered by phrases such as “residuary estate.” however, attention to simple elements of presentation and communication can enhance a collaborator’s sense of a statistician’s contributions. one should not underestimate the value of word of mouth or the impact of a single positive collaboration in changing image, in either a positive or a negative direction. for ex ample, at the national institutes of health, biostatisticians are now a part of the fabric of that eminent scientific organization, whereas in the 1950s, they were not. the change came gradually, a few converts at a time. at the professional society level, asa is moving at a good pace in several areas that will enhance general public recognition and outreach to other scientific communities. to name a few initiatives: we have a planning group for an undergraduate statistics initiative that will address the needs of undergraduate education to meet the requirements of potential employers. we have established a new outreach continuing education committee to infiltrate and proselytize other scientific groups. we have a presidential swat team that is geared up and has responded to public issues on behalf of the profession. we have been publishing chance magazine since 1998, a lay periodical designed for anyone who has an interest in the analysis of data or its use in society. our recently completed strategic plan has as a major component the enhancement of education in and awareness of statistical science at all levels. nonetheless, each of you, the members of our profession, must be our ambassadors of good will and promoters of the profession. asa as an organization can provide some of the tools, but your professional organization is not going to get into the mindsets of the groups with which you collaborate. ultimately, a statistician’s significance is up to you.",257,21.2918287937743,5.1812865497076,0.285453216374269,5472,1562,18.5729872061802,13.5729872061802,37,0.768925694767304,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2000.10473893"

honored to officially welcome you to jsm 2000 and to the 160th annual meeting of the statistical association. before getting to the business at hand, i have been charged by a famous minnesotan to report that it has been a quiet year in lake woebegon, minnesota, my home town, where all the men are good looking, all the women are strong, and all the children are above average. i’ve come to the conclusion that many of my predecessors faced the prospect of making this presentation with the same anticipation with which king arthur faced his wedding night. “he’s wishing he was in scotland  fishing tonight.” and, much as king arthur had merlin to advise him, i found no shortage of wisdom in the words of my predecessors. lynne billard, our 91st president, advised me to begin work on this presentation early a serious challenge when faced with several grant applications and other addresses to prepare. bob hogg, our 83rd president, had, in his inimitable style, a very concrete and tempting suggestion: “just read my talk; nobody remembers it.” my immediate predecessor, jonas ellenberg, advised prozac, but what i really needed was prilosec. the redoubtable philosopher and our 93rd president, david moore, said, “just remember lincoln.” at  first i didn’t understand. then i recalled, within lincoln’s most famous speech given at gettysburg, the words upon which i suspect david was trying to get me to focus: “the world will little note nor long remember what we say here.” clearly, lincoln was a poor prophet regarding his own words, but as to the rest of us “orators,” it is surely a good point to keep in mind. don’t take yourself, or your message, too seriously. the writings of other predecessors were also interesting. our 80th president, john neter, concluded, after reading the presentations of several of his predecessors, that asa presidents worry a lot (neter 1986). while i suspect you will  find some of that in my words, i will try not to overburden you with my angst. earlier, ralph bradley, our 76th president, indicated that he was depressed after reading the addresses of several of his predecessors (bradley 1982). it seemed that everything that he had thought to say had already been said. i certainly had the same experience, unfortunately not a good enough reason to decline the honor of this presentation. in this auspicious year 2000, the urge to look both forward and backward proved irresistible and, like many before me, i succumbed to the temptation of reviewing our history in an attempt to foresee our future. what i have tried to do, which may be unique, is to use the annual meeting as a vehicle for my reflections. 2. 1839–1899 the annual meeting of the statistical association, which occurs at what we now refer to as the joint statistical meetings (jsm), did not spring miraculously in its current form from the minds of our progenitors. in 1839 in boston our founders conceived of an organization which, for only a blessedly few weeks, they called the statistical society. article ii of the original constitution stated that “the objects of the society shall be to collect, preserve and diffuse statistical information in the different departments of human knowledge” (historical exhibits, 1940, p. 298). the constitution charged this newly formed society to hold an annual meeting in boston on the  first wednesday of february to “hear the report of the board of directors and of the treasurer and of the librarian, to elect of cers and to transact other necessary business.” (ibid., p. 299). this charge says nothing about presentations. at the  first meeting on february 5, 1840, the constitution was debated and accepted but no presentation was made (ibid., p. 301). in april 1840, “mr. shattuck read an article on the statistics of saxony” (ibid., p. 302). this was the  first presentation at a meeting of the asa. attendance at that meeting was 10. it may be surmised that these meetings were unchanged in structure throughout the 19th century because in 1902 the constitution still specified that the annual meeting be held in boston with business described exactly as in 1839 (constitution, 1902, p. 203). on december 31, 1896, president francis a. walker addressed the washington members of the asa at the cosmos club. in his remarks he indicated that “at the last meeting of the asa it was determined to invite and empower the members of the association residing in and about the city of washington to hold scienti c meetings in washington as part of the regular proceedings of the association” (walker 1897). this meeting was momentous for several reasons: 1. it may have been the seed for the wss. 2. president walker died  ve days later. 3. the expression “scientific meetings” is used. 4. meetings in cities other than boston may be part of the “regular proceedings of the association.” 5. by implication, the “annual” meeting was still the official “business meeting” of the association. 6. by implication, the annual meeting was still to be held in boston. 3. 1900–1928 carroll d. wright, president walker’s successor, gave the  first of the annual “presidential addresses” at the 69th annual meeting of the asa on january 17, 1908, in boston. in this presentation, president wright stated in reference to the association that “there never [has] been a year since its organization that it has not held meetings and had papers of a statistical character” (wright 1908). with association membership down to 300 from a high of 550 a few years earlier, the board decided that drastic steps were necessary and, later that year, december 1908, the 70th “annual meeting” of the association and the  first held outside of boston was held in atlantic city, with about 40 members present. this was a true watershed event for our meetings and for our association. the presidential address was given by s.n.d. north, who referred to efforts in boston earlier that year as “an organized movement to bring this old and honorable organization out of the rut of mere existence and into the strenuous activities of today.” scheduling meetings outside of boston with other societies was part of this movement to make the association more national and less parochial. north labeled the initial efforts in that direction, beginning with president walker’s 1896 visit to washington, a failure. he indicated that the success of the new effort was by no means assured (north 1909). this effort continued with the 71st annual meeting held in new york, december 27–30, 1909, in conjunction with nine other associations. the proceedings of that meeting summarized the program “which most directly concerned the members of the asa.” it included four sessions, two on monday, one on wednesday, and one on thursday, plus a business meeting. vice president walter willcox gave the presidential address, president wright, having died in office earlier in 1909. at the business meeting, a resolution was passed that “the office of president of this association should not be held by any one person for more than 2 consecutive years,” and the nominating committee presented the name of s. n. d. north to be president in 1910 (doten 1909). for the next two decades the meeting seemed to be fairly static in form. with one exception, all meetings were held for 2–4 days during the week between christmas and new year’s. the meetings were distributed among 11 cities with 3 from the center of the country hosting 6 meetings and 8 eastern cities hosting the remaining 14 (table 1). all of these meetings involved board meetings interspersed with sessions. however, things were changing. while the 71st meeting had only 4 sessions, the 90th meeting in 1928 in chicago had 17 with multiple competing sessions at 10 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each day. of interest is a session at 2:30 on the  first day entitled “mathematical statistics,” with the topic being “judging the significance of statistical conclusions” (program, 90th annual meeting, 1929). clearly, we would all feel at home at a meeting with competing sessions including a session entitled mathematical statistics with harold hotelling as one of the speakers. some  nal notes about the two decades from 1909 to 1928: 1. the programs at the annual meeting were completely in the hands of the president, a situation destined not to change for another decade. table 1. venues for asa annual meetings 1910–1949 venues 1910–1929 1930–1949 east washington, dc 4 3 atlantic city 2 2 boston 2 — new york city 2 3

introduced in 1923 by president warren e. perssons, it was not followed regularly for some time. 3. most meetings were held in some loose collaboration with other associations, frequently as many as 10. the most common of these companion associations was the economics association. indeed, the board minutes often contained instructions to the president to make every effort to determine when the economists were to meet and to schedule the asa meeting accordingly. 4. as a consequence of the many associations holding meetings simultaneously, it was not uncommon for there to be several “presidential addresses” at the same evening event, after which a “smoker” was usually scheduled. 4. 1929–1948 the 20 years from 1929 through 1948, with the worldwide depression followed by world war ii, were momentous for the entire world, the profession, the asa, and its annual meetings. of the 18 meetings during these two decades (table 1), 10 were on the eastern seaboard, and chicago was the most westerly venue. the orientation of our profession to the eastern half of the country had clearly continued. in general the meetings were thriving. the number of sessions increased from 15 in 1929 to 38 in 1937 before an inevitable tapering as war approached. in 1929, asa president edwin b. wilson of harvard titled his presidential address “mathematics and statistics.” in the introductory paragraph, he said, “so many persons behave as though a great deal of mathematical background were essential to a safe and satisfactory practice of statistics : : : many others behave in the directly contrary way.” he concluded with the statement, “it must be apparent that i am taking my life in my hands” (wilson 1930, p. 1). as he walked the  fine line to save his life, he argued that we need “to foster useful, appropriate, correct mathematics applied to worthwhile scientific problems” and that “in these vital matters we have far more need of good taste and a sure instinct than is commonly believed” year. president wilson’s cautious plea for “good taste and a sure instinct” was certainly diplomatically appropriate. however, his earlier expression of concern for his life might give a more accurate sense of the emotional climate within our profession during the 1930s and 1940s. these emotions, which remain palpable today, arose from a conflict that had a major impact on our profession, our association, and our meetings. as figure 1 illustrates, the president’s address notwithstanding, the 1929 program had no methodological content. however, the 1930 meeting seemed to cement the presence of methodology on the program with 6 of the 24 sessions identifiable as methodology sessions. participants included such pioneers as rietz, carver, shewhart, hotelling, sewall wright, and truman kelley (program, 91st annual meeting, 1930). however, most programs from 1931 until after world war ii had only 1 or 2 methodology sessions—hardly a reflection of what was happening in the real statistical world! the 1930s were truly an astounding decade. asa board minutes early in this period contain many references to the “mathematical members,” and in 1930 the asa launched a new journal, the annals of mathematical statistics. however, the dearth of methodology sessions at the annual meetings suggests perhaps a somewhat lukewarm attitude by the asa leaders, who essentially controlled the content of each program. unfortunately, after only three years of publication, during admittedly difficult  financial times, the asa deemed it necessary to stop supporting the annals. all material regarding the annals was forwarded to its editor, harry c. carver, with a resolution that the asa members “desire to express their admiration and deep appreciation of the services professor carver has rendered to the science of statistics and to the asa in founding and editing the annals of mathematical statistics. it is their sincere hope that the future of the annals may be one of high success” (king 1934, p. 195). this action led directly to the creation of the institute of mathematical statistics ( ims) in 1935, according to the “history of the ims” found on the ims web site (www.imstat.org). at an asa board meeting in february of 1935 there was a discussion of “sectional groups” apparently focused primarily on the “mathematical statisticians.” in this discussion the president, professor king, stated that “the vice presidents were free to organize meetings in their respective fields and that this provided substantially all the machinery that was needed by sectional groups.” this was obviously too little too late for the mathematical statisticians, who formed a separate association just a few months later. however, in november 1935 at an asa board meeting, “ in response to dr. joseph berkson and dr. lowell reed it was voted that a committee on biometrics be appointed.” and in less than three years on april 14, 1938, “a section is hereby established to be known as the biometrics section.” thus was the  first section of the asa established. a bit of speculation regarding the differences in the reactions within the asa to the mathematical statisticians and the biometricians might be worthwhile. likely the fact that the biometricians were clearly applied statisticians was helpful. our foundations had been among very applied people who were no doubt threatened by the “new” mathematical types. the timing of the biometricians’ appeal might also have been a factor, since the leaders may have feared further divisiveness within the association. seven years after the creation of the biometrics section, the biometrics bulletin was published under the auspices of the asa. two years later, it became biometrics and, the year after the creation of the international biometrics society in 1948, the publication of biometrics was transferred to the biometrics society. the creation of this new society did not destroy the biometrics section of the asa. indeed, it has thrived as a large, active section from which at least one other section has been spawned. is it not a shame that we don’t have a comparable section of mathematical statistics in the asa? these were not the only major events in the statistical world during the period just before world war ii. in 1935, the asa combined with many of the associations with which it had often met to form the allied social sciences association. the  first of the meetings sponsored by this association, called the allied meetings, was held in 1936 in chicago. actually, most of the meetings between 1908 and the early 1950s could be called “allied.” however, with the formation of the ims in 1935 and the international biometrics society in 1948, meetings involving only statistical societies began to be held and were called joint meetings. at an asa board meeting in january 1935: “mr. burgess inquired about the possibilities of holding annual meetings at a time more convenient to non academic members, possibly in september, and the secretary was requested to consult other associations regarding that possibility.” the  rst such meeting was a joint meeting held in montreal, canada, in september of 1954. for the next 20 years, the asa held its annual meeting as part of the allied meetings in december once every three years and jointly with our statistical colleagues in the late summer during the other two years. the last of the allied meetings in which the asa participated was held in december 1973 in new york city. at an asa board meeting in september of 1935 a proposal was presented by miss aryness joy, later to become asa president aryness joy wickens, suggesting that, as an experiment, “a program for one of the section meetings of the statistical association be made up of papers submitted in competition. this is designed to afford a chance for younger members who are not well known to the programmakers to be invited to speak; to promote wider interest in the program; and to introduce more variety than is now obtained by inviting the same persons to present papers year after year.” this was essentially the introduction of the contributed session concept, which was implemented, without reference to a competition, at the annual meeting in 1938, with the  first officially designated “contributed papers” session, arranged by the biometrics section. world war ii forced the cancellation of the 1942 and 1943 annual meetings. the asa held a meeting in 1944 with the vice president of the united states, an asa member, giving a special address. helen walker, our  first female president, gave one of the most eloquent of all of the presidential addresses i have read. she justified holding even a limited annual meeting on the grounds that meetings were crucial to the well being of our association and that many statisticians had played a vital role in the war effort. she accepted for the asa a healing role in working to close the gap separating the theorist from the practical statistician, a critical role for all of us in the profession today. she charged the individual professional statisticians and the association as follows: “at a time like the present when almost everyone is trying to foresee the nature of the world which lies ahead and to dedicate his best intelligence to promoting the welfare of the world, it is inevitable that a national gathering of statisticians should face the question of what contribution the statistical association might be expected to make to the general well being of society.” and she continued: “it seems obvious that the conscious purpose of the association must be to facilitate in every way possible the most informed, effective, intelligent application of statistical methods to those problems in government, in jurisprudence, in public administration, in the sciences, in business, commerce, industry, education,  nance, for which the evidence that should be taken into account is stochastic in nature” (walker 1945, p. 2). here one must  figuratively pause for breath and ask, “what would president walker think of us now and how could we better charge ourselves for our equally problematic future?” so, where were we vis ja vis our annual meeting as we stood on the threshold on the second half of the 20th century just over 50 years ago? 1. the meetings were still being held the last week in december, but changes were afoot. 2. the number of sessions, which a quarter of a century earlier had numbered six in three days, had increased  five fold over the same three days. 3. agenda planning, which had been in the hands of the president, was put in the hands of a program committee for the  first time in 1944, a change made permanent by 1948. 4. site planning, which had been done just a few months before the meeting, was now being done two or three years in advance. 5. sections (three by 1950) played a major role in preparing the scientific program. 6. contributed papers,  first discussed in 1935 and used in 1938, caught on slowly with only three sessions in 1947. 7. meeting attendance, which was said to be 40, or about 13% of membership, in 1908, was reported as 600, about 12% of membership, in 1948. 8. asa membership, about 1,000 in 1920, was about 5,000. 5. 1949–1999 although, in 1949, a long overdue revision of the constitution was implemented, it was not until 1975 that the membership had an opportunity to participate in a competitive election for president elect. figure 2 illustrates the trends in numbers of invited and contributed sessions in the annual programs of the last half of the 20th century. at the 1949 allied meetings in chicago, with all three of the statistical associations participating, there were 47 sessions on the statistical program, only two of them contributed. the meeting lasted four full days, with one period of four sessions each morning and two periods each afternoon with three or four sessions each. a dedicated member could have attended 16 (34%) of the 47 sessions. a half century later, at jsm 1999 in baltimore, there were 445 sessions spread over 13 time periods with between 24 and 27 sessions scheduled in each period. there, a dedicated member would have been able to attend only about 5% of the sessions. with over half of the sessions in baltimore being contributed, it is obvious that the association has embraced the contributed paper concept  first broached in 1935. however, in 1999 these included poster sessions, roundtables, and other sessions unheard of in 1949. clearly, the statistical association today bears little resemblance to the association founded in 1839 or to the one that struggled “in the rut of mere existence” at the turn of the last century. our leaders in the 1930s made mistakes but also planted seeds of organizational change, which permitted us to evolve. membership growth and meetings growth have naturally moved somewhat in parallel. being careful not to attribute causality, we can, nonetheless, observe that, as we have acquired more  flexibility in site selection, program definition, and incorporation of new concepts into the meeting, we have apparently been responding to needs felt by the membership. during the last two decades of the 20th century, a schematic illustrating the growth in the number of sessions at the asa annual meetings, 1949–1999, comparing the growth in invited paper sessions (light shading) with that in contributed paper sessions (dark shading). attendance has averaged about 19% of asa membership, in contrast to the 12% and 13%  figures quoted earlier. let me now quickly summarize events of the past halfcentury in these broad categories: geography: the annual meeting did not truly go west until the 1960 meeting at stanford university. indeed, we held our annual meeting west of the mississippi river only 15 times in the 20th century. thus, as far as the jsm is concerned, we remain an association with stronger ties to the east than to the west. site planning: with jsm attendance above 3,000 throughout the past decade and with the number of sessions above 400 and rising,  finding sites that have adequate facilities to accommodate us at acceptable  financial rates is not simple. this task is made even more challenging by the membership’s desire to meet at sites that are simultaneously aesthetically appealing, economically accessible, and geographically dispersed. with 25–30 simultaneous sessions, we must have that many rooms of various sizes available during most time periods, and we must synchronize the program since even a modest asynchrony could result in a need for more meeting rooms and associated extra cost. now, the asa board has divided the country into  five regions and established a plan by which the meeting site is rotated among these regions. obviously transportation is not the problem it was early in the 20th century nor are we as bound to the site of the federal government as we once were, although meetings in washington always attract more attendees than elsewhere. we now schedule the sites at least seven years in advance. the next eight meetings are scheduled at the following sites: 2001, atlanta; 2002, new york city; 2003, san francisco; 2004, toronto; 2005, minneapolis; 2006 seattle; 2007, salt lake city; 2008, washington, dc. program planning: today, the program committee for a jsm begins its work two years before the meeting. to make this possible, it is necessary to select a program chair even earlier. thus, last spring our two candidates for president elect were presented a list of proposed program chairs from which they selected nat schenker to chair the program committee for jsm 2002 in new york. nat has already begun to prepare his committee for the task of organizing the complex program that will be presented in 2002. program structure: in 1949 the program was conducted over a period of three days with one morning time slot and two afternoon time slots. since the last allied meeting in 1973, our meetings have been held in august with two time periods each morning and afternoon. until recently, the  first scientific sessions were on monday morning. now the meeting begins with scientific sessions sunday afternoon and runs until thursday noon, giving us four full days of sessions. continuing education: the jsm 2000 continuing education program from saturday through wednesday includes 41 educational opportunities with more than 1,400 registrations. this major activity at the jsm had its humble beginning in 1975 in atlanta with a “short course” offered after the meeting. the board minutes suggest a debate about this proposed innovation and concerns as to who would attend. they solved the attendance problem by arranging for john tukey and dave hoaglin to make a series of presentations regarding john’s new ideas of exploratory data analysis, and 150 of us attended. this seems an appropriate time to acknowledge the recent death of one of the modern giants of our profession. john wilder tukey died july 26, 2000, at the age of 85. tukey’s contributions to our discipline and to many other scientific disciplines are legendary. those of you who had the honor of working with him are truly to be envied. those of us who knew him through his works as an outstanding member of our profession and our association are thankful for having such a colleague. the short course experiment was replicated at jsm 1976 in boston with a “short course” based on the newly published discrete multivariate analysis: theory and practice, by yvonne bishop, steve feinberg, and paul holland. one more replication occurred the next year in chicago with ram gnanadesikan, jon kettenring, and paul tukey presenting two days of lectures entitled “data analysis of multivariate observations” on the saturday and sunday before the meeting. after those three successful experiments, a formal continuing education activity was begun. at  first, courses of varying lengths on a multitude of topics were offered only before the meeting. subsequently, as it became clear that some members come to the jsm primarily for the continuing education opportunities and, for them, conflicts with scientific sessions are of little consequence, the ce program has been offered from saturday through wednesday. last year, in baltimore there were 38 course offerings with a total of 1,258 registrations. employment services: it is not so easy to trace the development of the employment activities at the jsm. initially, the cosponsoring societies invited the state employment agency to set up a facility to bring employers and prospective employees together. the asa now runs this activity. an incomplete report of  ve of the six years between 1976 and 1982 shows an average of 275 openings and 375 applicants. last year in baltimore, there were 285 openings and 225 prospective employees. these numbers belie the extent of this activity, with the employment center frequently overcrowded with individuals attempting to identify opportunities and to set up interviews. again, there are some whose primary reason for attending the jsm is to interview or to be interviewed for employment opportunities. because such opportunities are spread across a wide spectrum of educational levels, this service attracts a diverse group of statisticians to the jsm. exhibits: none of the programs of the early meetings mention exhibits. since we often met with many other social science societies, it seems likely that book publishers had exhibits. a board minute in 1933 expressed some skepticism about a request from international business machines to set up a display. we are left to wonder what it was and whether it occurred. at the past 16 jsms, there have been over 200 individual exhibitors. this year at jsm 2000 there are 71 of which 9 are new and 11 have exhibited at all of the last 16 jsm’s. before speculating about the future, i would like to acknowledge the efforts of an individual who played a major role in shaping the jsm during the last 15 years. mrs. lee decker has been the asa staff member in charge of meetings for the past 15 years. every one of us who chaired a program committee or the committee on meetings during that time worked closely with lee and came to rely on her advice and depend on her willingness to spend long hours assuring the success of the meetings, and we appreciate her commitment to the asa. lee will be retiring next may, so this may be the last jsm she will attend. it is certainly the last jsm that she can truly call her own, although she has had a great deal to do with the site selections announced earlier. those of us who were mentored by her have taken this opportunity to honor her with a plaque that contains the following inscription: to lee decker “ in recognition of outstanding, consistent professionalism and initiative in meetings organization and management, particularly for the joint statistical meetings from 1986–2000.” 6. the future: 2000–? we have reviewed the evolution of the meeting that we number today as the 160th annual meeting of the asa and considered, to some extent, how it reflected and/or influenced change occurring in the profession and the association. now comes the hard part. it is easy to say that we got where we are because we—the profession, the association, and the annual meetings—have evolved. indeed, had we not evolved, we would no longer exist. at the modern jsms we have many sessions with many different statistical contents because we have become a much more diverse profession than we were and because the association must reflect that diversity in its activities. we have many contributed sessions, multiple ce offerings, employment services, and extensive exhibits because many of us take advantage of them. we have roundtables, posters, social events, and so forth because there is inherent in the human psyche the need to retain contacts with former colleagues, create new contacts, and, in general, to have social discourse with those with whom we share like interests. so what does the future hold? before i speculate, let me comment about and quote from a presentation made by 1936 asa president joseph s. davis at our centenary celebration 60 years ago (davis 1940). as many have before and since, he found it useful to contemplate the past, and he began by quoting de tocqueville, whose treatise democracy in america was written about the time that the asa was founded. davis was particularly intrigued with de tocqueville’s comments about s’ penchant for forming associations and quoted him as saying that “feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed, only by the reciprocal influence of men upon each other.” and further that “ in order that an association amongst a democratic people should have any power, it must be a numerous body” (ibid., p. 263). regarding the asa of 1939, davis wrote that “we have continued a catholic organization—welcoming into membership all who are seriously concerned with statistics, regardless of their  eld of interest or their level of attainment” (ibid., p. 263). to this i offer a hearty amen and observe that, if that was true in 1939, consider how much more so it is true today. look upon our meeting rooms full of colleagues of both genders, multiple heritages, and catholic interests and accomplishments. we are all statisticians and proud of it! but, as a corollary, i believe that we must be a catholic organization seeking out and embracing “all who are seriously concerned with statistics.” davis said of the meetings as he knew them, “the programs of the annual meetings have come to be a striking contrast to those of the early days” and “the variety of the menu offered is such that no one can go away hungry, whatever the limitations upon his statistical diet” (ibid., p. 264). what would he think if he could see us now? and yet, are we sure that no one goes home hungry despite the over owing smorgasbord of opportunities? when he turned to play the role of the prophet, he declared his lack of competence but then marched bravely on where no one had gone before. assuming, on the eve of world war ii, that the united states and the asa would survive and thrive, he predicted that the “next century,” which is now 60 years old, would be marked by changes in our profession, which, in retrospect will seem revolutionary. regarding meetings, he said, “ i expect our annual meetings to continue multiple ring circuses, with only occasional hours reserved for general sessions. only thus can we hope to serve the needs of our diverse membership.” davis anticipated that the meetings would be planned “months or even a year earlier” and that the papers would be circulated in advance of the meeting. he also anticipated that we would improve our ability to present tabular and graphic material for “ in this respect our practice has lagged too far behind our knowledge” (ibid., p. 272). obviously he was right on regarding several points and somewhat conservative regarding others. he could not have envisioned the technology that i am using to make this presentation, but he certainly recognized the need for something like it. unfortunately, i believe we have fallen short of his optimistic prediction about presentations. i believe too that, if the asa continues to exist and hold meetings, the meetings must continue to be “the multiple ring circuses” that they have become and that the acts in the rings will change in ways none of us can foresee. the technological advances of the past two decades have changed our profession dramatically and are changing it even more dramatically as we speak. these advances have altered and will continue to affect our meetings. in the last few years, the asa has developed an essential presence on the world wide web. today, we can use the web to register for the jsm, review the program of the jsm, create our own itineraries for the jsm, and review abstracts of jsm presentations. can it be long before the actual presentations themselves will be available on the web for those interested members of the profession who could not attend? this is already being done in other societies, and, if that is possible, why have an actual meeting at all? why not a virtual meeting where we each post our presentations on our personal web site and have the meeting program provide author, title, and url? how depressing! can we last long as a professional association in such a situation? apparently de touqueville did not think so, for davis quotes him as writing, “ if men are to remain civilized or to become more so, the art of associating together must grow and improve.” but he also wrote, “means must be found to converse everyday without seeing each other, and to take steps in common without having met.” (ibid., p. 263) every day at my desk i do what he described, using a technology which he could not have envisioned. will this type of social and professional discourse be enough to hold us together as a professional society? i think not. i have had occasion to examine a new sociological treatise entitled bowling alone: the collapse and revival of community,” by r. d. putnam, a professor of public policy at harvard (putnam 2000). while the title of this book belies its serious content, it prompts me to remark parenthetically that i used to bowl on a team in north carolina, which, at various times included several statisticians. but that is not the point. on our team and on other teams in the league were individuals with whom i had contact in general social discourse. i bought insurance from one, a car from another, service for my car from another, and so forth. is it too far fetched to see the asa as the league and all of our sections, chapters, committees, and special interest groups as teams? where would we be if there was no league? the primary message of this book is that society has turned more and more to personal pursuits rather than to group or social pursuits. the author traces the evidence in several ways, one of which is a decline in the number of bowling leagues and another is the relative decline in professional society memberships. he believes that the very survival of our society depends on our reversing this trend, and he calls for a restoration of the tendencies that de tocqueville had found so intriguing in our early society. if the time should ever come when all our meetings are “virtual” in the sense i just described, can the demise of our venerable association be far behind? 7. conclusion a century ago, our predecessors turned to the annual meeting as a tool to invigorate a moribund association. today we are not moribund, but our very existence is threatened by a society and a profession that is changing at a pace heretofore not experienced nor imagined. recall that davis quoted de touqueville as suggesting that we must be a numerous society to survive and have influence. if we accept this thesis, then we must consider whether the continued survival of the asa is critical to anyone? i contend that the survival of the asa is critical to the entire profession of statistics. the theme of this meeting is “celebrate diversity in statistics.” this was not meant as a call for a celebration that we have achieved a goal but rather as a plea for us to recognize that there is naturally a great diversity in our profession. in biological systems, diversity is strength, but in social systems there is potential for self destruction if the diversity is divisive. if each of our many sections became a professional society unto itself, we would have a weak and ineffectual assortment of many small societies. the largest statistical society in the world has strength and influence that are critical to everyone in the profession. we are the natural home for all of these diverse statisticians, but we must, to quote professor davis again, “welcome into membership all who are seriously concerned with statistics.” 1. the strategic initiatives that we have been focusing on for three years now have challenged us to accept responsibility for improving and strengthening our association. i believe the jsm provides us with special opportunities to do just that. we must use technology in all aspects to improve the meetings without creating virtual meetings. for example, can we  nd new and better ways to illustrate data, as davis envisioned 60 years ago? 2. today statistics is being taught at all levels from grade school on, and yet few of the k–16 teachers of statistics are members of our association or jsm attendees. can we  find ways at the jsm to provide them with opportunities for learning statistics or how to teach statistics— perhaps in the continuing education program, perhaps in the regular scientific program, or perhaps in a way i cannot envision. 3. we recognize that computers have revolutionized our discipline, but they have spawned another revolution of data production and data management in which statisticians are playing a minor role. can we entice the computer scientists who are leading this revolution into statistics through the jsm before it is too late and we lose yet another truly statistical area to individuals who don’t know how much they need statistical training? 4. we constantly complain about jsm presentations but seem unable or unwilling to do anything about them. with most of us functioning in an applied environment where we must communicate with those not conversant in mathematical symbols, we must learn new techniques of communication. what better place to do it than right here at the jsm? to accomplish our goals, we must be certain that we are ready, willing and able to assess the needs of the profession, including but not limited to the needs of our members, and then we must be sufficiently  flexible to respond. in 1908, all the board had to do was decide to meet in atlantic city and they did. during the 21st century, it will be much more complicated unless we begin soon to make some changes. thus, i call for the asa to continue to “celebrate diversity in statistics” not as a victory achieved but as a characteristic of our profession. let us use the jsm to embrace and enhance our diversity so that together we may “live long and prosper.”",354,19.4576271186441,4.80618466898955,0.254936120789779,6888,1756,15.9216453079785,10.9216453079785,15,2.58288657026948,"https://doi.org/10.1198/016214501753381797"

education, producers and users of data, the scientific community of scholars, and the public at large. properly constructed bridges to these constituencies can convey the positive contributions of statistical thinking for all, strong academic programs in statistics, the value added practice of statistics, and the infusion of statistics into interdisciplinary research. the conveyance must go both ways, however. in preparation for an address that occupies a position of tradition and respect, it is quite natural to look to the past to see what others considered to be the important points of the day and how they captured the essence of those points. going back just a few years, jon kettenring spoke of the need to reconstruct the image of statistics and to think of it holistically. david moore built an argument for statistical thinking as an inherently liberal art and made the point that our future as a discipline depends on our taking this broad view. jonas ellenberg pointed out that statistics receives more recognition than statisticians. michael o’fallon emphasized the diversity of statistics and the importance of meeting together to build a professional unity out of that diversity of individual interests. to get a wider historical perspective (and to pay respect to one of my mentors), i looked at ralph bradley’s address of more than 20 years ago. guess what? professor bradley pointed out that the future of statistics as a discipline was in some danger and urged us to mitigate this trend by improving our image, making sure that statisticians get recognized for their contributions of importance to society, and working together for the mutual bene t of all. perhaps in these addresses we do just rearrange deck chairs, but hopefully the chairs are not on the titanic. of course, the asa’s history goes back much farther than 1981. i do not intend to give a complete historical tour, but i will make reference to one more presidential address. in 1944–nearly 60 years ago–helen walker became the  rst female president of the asa. a statistical educator more than a researcher, professor walker had great insight into the needs of her day and spoke eloquently in favor of statistics as a key to societal improvement: ways must be found to make the general nature of statistical thinking better understood by the average intelligent citizen and particularly by persons … charged with policy formation.… the approximate nature of measurement should be taught in the secondary school.… if the public fails to value and support statistical research, we must take some of the blame ourselves in that we have failed to insist that the nature of statistical thinking is an appropriate topic for inclusion in a liberal education. sound familiar? indeed, statisticians do have an image problem. i am reminded of the new york times crossword puzzle clue “statistician’s margin of error,” with an 11 letter answer. their answer was “fudge factor!” statistics is more popular than statisticians, and we are a bit fragmented as a profession. the information age that is upon us will be either a bane or a blessing; it will either exacerbate our current weaknesses or force us into modes of action that will enhance our strengths. taking the optimistic view, i believe the latter is the order of the day, and that strengthening actions are already taking shape. the demand for statistics may be growing faster than the demand for statisticians, but even the latter is growing faster than the supply. there is hope for the future, but bringing hope to reality depends on increasing our numbers and widening our vision, while simultaneously improving the public perception of statistics. as statisticians, you are probably ready for a little data. table 1 shows the number of degrees granted in statistics by u.s. universities in two recent academic years. this selfreported data from amstat online is scant data on which to base trends, but we do see an increase in bachelor’s degrees, a smaller increase in master’s degrees, and not much change in doctoral degrees. another view of the doctoral degrees for mathematics and statistics departments is given by table 2, which shows an increase in doctoral degrees in statistics over recent years accompanied by a decrease in those degrees for the rest of the mathematical sciences. these data come from a survey covering about 85% of statistics and biostatistics departments, so the counts are low but the percentages should be on target. note that we did well, in comparison to mathematics, with regard to the percentage of females receiving doctoral degrees in 1999–2000. as to demand for statisticians, amstat online carried more than 750 job advertisements last year, many with multiple openings. my guess is that in most years there are about four times that many jobs for statisticians in the u.s. if we assume that about half of those granted degrees in statistics either go on for a higher degree or return to their home countries, the conclusion is that the demand is about twice the supply. there are not enough of us to go around, and therein lies a large part of our problem, for you see, most of those jobs will be  lled by someone. for the rest of this article i cast the work to be done around the image of building bridges. this image coveys the kind of structure i see as essential if we are to have a strong discipline of statistics within the complex world of data that surrounds us. i view the island of statistics as being in the midst (center, if you will) of other islands, all loosely connected by many bridges, so that a bridge to one may allow communication with many. we must develop our island without being isolated. we may dwell on other islands for a while and may even build cottages there, but we should not live there permanently. there should always be a tie to our home island of statistics, which nourishes us for further adventures. let me illustrate with an example from another discipline, writing. i am told that writing across the curriculum is not the same as writing in the disciplines. writing across the curriculum often succeeds because the program is guided by an english department, whereas writing in the disciplines often fails because the writing is left to the whim of the disciplinary expert. i opt for statistics across the curriculum— indeed, across society—nourished and directed from a strong home base. school curriculum k–12: numeracy for all the  first bridge to build is the one from our island to k–12 teachers and their students. it is the bridge marked “numeracy for all.” because we statisticians probably do not even have vacation cottages on that island, we really need to  nd allies among the math education experts, mathematicians, and policy makers who shape that environment. why k–12? because, to paraphrase bank robber willie sutton, that’s where the students are—almost all of the students who are the potential college students, workers, citizens, and leaders of the future. reaching them is the way to make a long term impact. why math? because that’s where the interest is. mathematics educators form the receptive community that is open to change, wants to both learn and teach statistics, and has a structure within which to propose and implement change. many math educators and mathematicians now see statistics as an essential part of the curriculum. statistics is in all new material and is especially strong in the modern curricula table 2. 2000 annual survey of the mathematical sciences: departments or

(nsf) support. it forms a central strand in the curriculum standards for school mathematics  rst produced by the national council of teachers of mathematics (nctm) in 1989 and revised in 2000. it appears on virtually all standardized tests (although not necessarily in a way we would like). even though there had been efforts to include elementary statistics in the school curriculum throughout the 20th century, little progress was made until the 1980s, when a combination of tukey, deming, and technology made data collection and analysis acceptable, pro table, and possible. it is still the enchantment with data that is the driving force behind the success of statistics in the schools. it may be enlightening to chart how we got to this stage, as it came about through a “percolate up” instead of a “trickle down” mode. motivated by work in the united kingdom, the asa quantitative literacy project (qlp) of the mid 1980s developed material at about the middle school level and spread the word through workshops for teachers. fortuitously, the nctm was writing the standards at the same time, and the enthusiasm among teachers for the “new” brand of statistics sold it to the leaders in mathematics education. i might add that the next successful nsf project on data analysis was at not the high school level but rather at the elementary level, when a product with the lovely title used numbers was unveiled in 1990. to this day, some of the most interesting work in cognitive aspects of learning statistics is being done at the elementary school level. the fact that many mathematical scientists have become sold on the idea that statistics is important as a practical skill, and even has something to offer as an intellectual pursuit, has helped to establish “quantitative literacy” (ql) as a currently popular topic in mathematics education. but this is not the ql as an alias for statistics that we developed in the qlp of the 1980s. the current ql is viewed as much more than statistics and incorporates all areas involved in using numerical information as a life skill. it has its roots in the 1982 u.k. study called mathematics counts, in which the term numeracy was popularized and de ned in part as an “at homeness” with numbers and an ability to make use of mathematical skills which enables an individual to cope with the practical demands of everyday life (cockcroft 1982). one of the broader definitions of numeracy, or ql, now in use is an aggregate of skills, knowledge, beliefs, dispositions, habits of mind, communication capabilities, and problem solving skills that people need in order to engage effectively in quantitative situations arising in life and work (national council on education and the disciplines 2001). this new ql is playing an expanding role among mathematics educators as one of the main objectives of k–12 (and undergraduate) education that goes well beyond the mathematics curriculum itself. in fact, a website called the national numeracy network (nnn) is currently being established to encourage the spread of ql. but all is not good news for statisticians. the leaders see statistics as only the small part of ql that deals with chance. i see statistics as much broader than that; in fact, i see it as encompassing much of the ql litany of topics that deal with data and its practical use in everyday situations. if you have a similar broad definition of statistics, then it behooves you to pay attention to the ql bandwagon, or soon statistics may be a small part of this educational juggernaut, which may become too big to cross any bridge. consider, for example, the fact that the nnn has no statisticians on its steering committee. my how things have changed in 20 years—all the way from mathematicians having little regard for statistics to mathematicians viewing statistics as an essential part of a broad curriculum in quantitative education, but with little need for statisticians to be involved. one way to have an ongoing impact on the future of ql and the teaching of statistics in the schools is to take seriously our responsibility for the education of future teachers. teacher education is a major national concern, and because statistics is one of the subjects they will be teaching with increasing regularity, it should be one of our major concerns. national academy of sciences (nas) president bruce alberts has called for scientists and scientific institutions to do more to support the efforts of science and math teachers in the nation’s schools: our collective and individual prestige will be wasted if we do not try to make a difference in every way that we can.… over the next 10 years, the middle and high schools will need to hire an estimated 170,000 new science and math teachers. therefore, the partnerships we need between colleges and school districts must involve all kinds of higher education institutions—from community colleges to research universities (alberts 2001). i might add that b/ i/g (bob hogg’s term for business, industry, and government) can help, too, as these communities have great impact on local school decisions. the emphasis on teachers and teaching is echoed in many recent reports. before it’s too late [national commission on mathematics and science teaching (glenn commission) 2000] states that we must improve the quality, number, and working conditions of k–12, mathematics and science teachers, summarizing with the memorable phrase, “students’ grasp of science and math is formulaic, fragile, or absent.” the mathematics education of teachers project (met) of the conference board of the mathematical sciences (cbms) expands the alberts theme that education is our responsibility and lays a solid content foundation under the global statements of the glenn commission report. with regard to statistics, which receives major emphasis, the report makes the points that statistics is the study of data, and the daily display of data by the media notwithstanding, most elementary teachers have little or no experience in this vitally important  field.… prospective teachers need both technical and conceptual knowledge of the statistics and probability topics now appearing in the middle grades curriculum.… at the high school level, traditional emphasis on probability based statistical inference has given way to focusing on data analysis to gain insight into problematic situations. funded by the department of education and the nsf, this report was officially released in september 2001, and a summit conference was held november 2 and 3, 2001 that focused on the issues it raised. many cbms members, including the asa, will be planning conferences and workshops to turn the met report into action. you may be aware of the fact that not everyone agrees on ways to improve mathematics teaching in this country. in fact, there has been so much disagreement that the “debate” has been nicknamed the “math wars.” in an attempt to harmonize the best ideas from both camps, the nas brought together a broad based group of educators with the objective of providing research based assessment of where math education is and where it should be heading. their report, adding it up (mathematics learning study committee 2001) does a great job of integrating diverse research and diametrically opposed opinions into a useful document that projects a sense of hope for the future. according to this report, mathematical proficiency has  five strands: ¡ conceptual understanding—comprehension of mathematical concepts, operations, and relations ¡ procedural  fluency—skill in carrying out procedures  flexibly, accurately, efficiently, and appropriately ¡ strategic competence—ability to formulate, represent, and solve mathematical problems ¡ adaptive reasoning—capacity for logical thought, reflection, explanation, and justification ¡ productive disposition—habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile now this is a beautiful combination of the issues delineated by the two warring parties: conceptual understanding and adaptive reasoning on the one side (the liberals) and procedural  fluency and strategic competence on the other (the conservatives). for us, the beauty is enhanced by the fact that statistics  fits into all  five strands and is a cornerstone of the  fifth (sensible, useful, and worthwhile). it has been seen over and over again that statistics changes attitudes about mathematics in the positive direction, and that is one of the key elements in the success of any reform curriculum. students do what they like to do. i mentioned earlier that much of the cognitive research on the learning of statistics has been done with young children. here are a couple of results as reported in adding it up: the research on the development of concepts of statistics and probability indicate that very young children are capable of less than developmental theories would predict. it is still an open question when and how many of the central conceptual structures of probability and statistics should be introduced in the elementary and middle grades. to make this a little more concrete, proportional reasoning is said by many to be the main theme of middle school mathematics. kids don’t get it, at least not easily. if confronted with two bags of balls, one containing two red and two white and one containing three red and four white, and asked which is more likely to produce a red ball in the usual random selection scenario, many children up to the middle school years will choose the bag with three red balls, because there are more opportunities for the desired outcome. if you stop to think about how often proportional reasoning is used in statistics, you see the problem of injecting too much too soon. you who are teachers also may be a little kinder to your undergraduates who simply cannot grasp what the slope of a regression line is telling them. students of all ages, but especially the young ones, view a data value as a separate isolated incident rather than as part of a distribution, and the notion of distribution is key to understanding variation and making judgments about what is usual versus what is unusual. as stephen jay gould put it, we must “understand variation itself as irreducible, as ‘real’ in the sense of ‘what the world is made of.’ read variation as the primary expression of natural reality”. distribution and variation are the keys to statistical thinking, and that moves us to the next bridge. school and college curriculum 11–14: statistical thinking for many statistics in grades 11–14 is centered on the introductory college level course. if the ideals espoused by many for the revamping of this course come to the fore, then the bridge to those who deliver and support this course might be called the “bridge to statistical thinking.” why a bridge? isn’t this on our home island? well, most introductory statistics is taught in departments other than statistics—mathematics, business, and social sciences chief among them, in both two year and four year colleges. and even if this course is taught in a statistics department, those responsible for it should be in contact with the user groups if the course is to provide the statistical insights that those diverse groups need. what is happening to enrollments in introductory statistics? the 2000 cbms survey of undergraduate teaching in mathematics and statistics shows a 16% increase in enrollment since 1995, with a greater increase in mathematics departments (18%) than in statistics departments (10%). we have no reliable data on enrollments outside of these departments, but some would put that enrollment at about equal to the total seen here. the mathematics departments now teach introductory statistics to about four times as many students as do statistics departments. ( i add that only 4% of statistics departments do anything special for future teachers.) returning to ql for a moment, those pushing ql for all k–12 students are also pushing for a similar type of expanded general education in quantitative reasoning for all college students. they may be more likely to succeed at the college level, because the paved highway to calculus that has dominated the high school and early college curriculum is showing some cracks, even among the mathematicians. as a result, there may be new openings for statistics as traditional college algebra, especially the remedial type, gives way to a new type of course that teaches students to understand and reason with the quantitative information that dominates their lives. the association for the advancement of science (aaas) is so interested in this “new” thinking about basic mathematics and the articulation between high school and college math that ql was one of the major themes at its meeting in february 2002. before that, a forum on ql was held on december 1 and 2, 2001 (a month after the summit on teacher education). opportunities come to those who are prepared to cooperate table 3. enrollments in introductory statistics (in thousands) statistics math depts math depts year depts 4 year 2 year totals 1995 49 115 72 236 2000 54 136 84ü 274 note: preliminary data from cbms survey, 2000. ü based on incomplete data. with the math department! for more on this theme, see the excellent article by moore and cobb (2000). statisticians have one more educational hurdle. we must educate college and university administrators to understand the role of introductory statistics in the modern curriculum, the laboratory nature of the course, and its relationship to ql. the introductory college course can play many important roles as it concentrates on statistical thinking. it can improve attitudes as well as knowledge. it can convey a broad perspective of statistics in society as well as a few basic skills. it can introduce students to an exciting career path. the advanced placement (ap) statistics course, an introductory course of the type being discussed here, has changed attitudes of both teacher and students and has actually become fun for both. here is one of many testimonials as to the value of this course: i would like to echo the comments about the value of an early statistics education. yesterday, our ap psychology teacher told me how much difference she sees between students with a stats background and students without. she said the difference was like “night and day,” especially with project work. our science teachers are saying the same thing. i guess what i am saying is what a lot of us already believe: a knowledge of statistics enriches every other discipline and life in general. three cheers for statistics! josh tabor, wilson hs, hacienda heights, ca i will not discuss the progress of ap statistics here, but will tell you that there were more than 100 summer institutes scheduled for ap statistics teachers in 2001. college curriculum 14–16: academic concentrations for a few although every college and university offers at least one introductory statistics course, the undergraduate program beyond the introductory course is very spotty—an occasional creative oasis in a largely empty desert. the issue of developing statistics programs beyond the  first course—of building academic concentrations—was the main focus of the asa’s undergraduate statistics education initiative begun 2 years ago. a set of guidelines on undergraduate programs in statistics designed to help institutions that want to expand or restructure offerings of some substance is now available from amstat online. written by a team of statisticians from academia, industry, and government, this document outlines the structure of a good undergraduate program without being prescriptive. of course, students should learn certain statistical, mathematical, and computational skills, but they should also learn to communicate, collaborate, and organize, and they should have more than a nodding acquaintance with at least one other substantive area. the approach to teaching statistics should ¡ emphasize real data and authentic applications ¡ present data in a context that is both meaningful to students and indicative of the science behind the data ¡ include experience with statistical computing ¡ encourage synthesis of theory, methods, and applications ¡ offer frequent opportunities to develop communication skills to encourage the development of undergraduate programs in a wide variety of institutions, the report emphasizes flexibility in academic requirements experimentation with course content and structure communication among academics, students, and advisors because statistics does not generate large numbers of majors at the undergraduate level, joint work with other disciplinary departments is essential for building a successful program, whether for majors or minors. that is where the real bridge building comes into the picture. this is not easy and may require some course restructuring (and renaming). for example, courses called “data mining,” “data warehousing,” “modeling with data,” “data smoothing,” and other such data oriented terms have been found to be quite successful in attracting the attention of faculty and students on various campuses. these courses are springing up in other departments around campuses, so why not ours? it is essential that we build a strong undergraduate presence not only for the strengthening of undergraduate curricula that meets the needs of the information age across disciplines, but also for establishing a source of potential graduate students in statistics. producers and users of data: value added practice as we move from students to the producers and users of data, we have the makings of a complicated bridge, because neither end of the bridge is  firmly planted on our island. on the one hand, many producers and users of data do their own statistical analyses and see no need for help from a statistician; on the other hand, even when they do employ a statistician, that employee often is not a member of the asa or any other professional group of statisticians. so we have a bit of reclamation to do on our island to ensure that the applied statisticians (often those with masters or bachelors degrees in the  field) can become an integral part of the professional statistics community, feel comfortable there, and see value in being connected to the larger group. we need the applied statisticians to help us build the bridge of value added practice. a recently appointed membership task force is charged with seeking ways for the asa to better serve its current members, identifying prospective members, and recruiting new members. in other words, they are to help direct the reclamation i just mentioned. further, they are to help structure the bridge to the other side (the producers and users) because the charge also states the following: although membership is essential to the viability of the association, the goals of the task force should have the broader perspective of enhancing the visibility of statistics as a profession and the integrity of its practice. managers in business and industry, those who make policy decisions in public and private sectors, information services officers in countless organizations, quality technicians—do any of these folks see a need for statisticians? why should they if they seem to be performing all right on their own? the easy answer from our perspective is that “all right” may not be good enough, and statisticians can add something of value. (or, as our resident philosopher, vice president fritz scheuren, might say, “don’t let the better be the enemy of the good enough.”) but how do we convince others that we have something of value to offer? speaking particularly about industry but with a message that resonates across a wider audience, gerald hahn and roger hoerl have pointed out that everyone does computing too, but today’s computer scientists are not exactly on the unemployment line—they are just working at a higher level.… statisticians need to similarly expand their horizons. our unique value added to the organization of the future may include bringing an improvement mindset … to the team and the ability to take a holistic approach to problem definition and resolution, as well as our critical quantitative skills” (hahn and hoerl 1998). anyone with a computer can now analyze data; it is up to statisticians to show that we can do more than that—we can be creative problem solvers and leaders. scientific community of scholars: multidisciplinary research the information age is also an age of multidisciplinary research, and that certainly implies bridge building. the problems of today are too complicated to be solved by one person or by one specialty. or, as some researchers put it, we have answered all the easy questions. possible bridges can be seen in the report of the interagency committee on extramural mathematical sciences programs, covering the role of mathematical sciences in six mission agencies: department of defense, department of energy, national institutes of health, national security agency, national institute of standards and technology, and environmental protection agency. according to the report, “there is a growing reliance on multidisciplinary approaches to the technical challenges faced by these agencies.” certain common themes emerged across all agencies: mathematics is central to modeling, design, and analysis of large datasets and complex dynamical systems. management of uncertainty is key to decision making. understanding, representing, and visualizing large sets of high dimensional data are critical needs. in much the same spirit, the current emphasis on mathematical sciences at the nsf is built around fundamental research, interdisciplinary science and engineering, and education. reference to statistics is made repeatedly in its connections to large datasets, modeling uncertainty, and modeling complex nonlinear systems. more examples of the multidisciplinary nature of modern research can be seen in other priority areas of the nsf, such as environmental research, information technology, and learning for the 21st century. as the social sciences become increasingly quantitative, the nsf is placing increased emphasis on the development, application, and extension of models and methodologies for social and behavioral research that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. a few statistics departments are building connections to the social sciences to take advantage of such opportunities; more must follow suit. our own national institute of statistical sciences (niss) has four main thrusts in its program for 2001/2002: bioinformatics and genomics, confidentiality of data, customer behavior, and data quality. all of these have multidisciplinary implications. because research and graduate education go hand in hand, it follows that graduate education must prepare students for a wide range of jobs in the information age; we do both our students and society a disservice if we do less. in the words of a national research council report (committee on science, engineering, and public policy 1995) of a few years ago, a world of work that has become more interdisciplinary, collaborative, and global requires that we produce young people who are adaptable and  flexible, as well as technically proficient.… students should be discouraged from overspecializing. in reminding you once more that education starts much earlier than graduate school, let me point out that the 2002 federal budget contains $20 million for expansion of multidisciplinary mathematics research, but $200 million for math and science partnerships between states and universities to improve k–12 education. we must make effective use of both research and education programs to increase the quantity and quality of future statisticians and to build a healthy respect for statistics in society. in fact, education should become a respected research area in some of our academic departments, so that we can bring to life a  field called statistics education. the public and its leaders: image perhaps more important than any of the aforementioned bridges is the bridge of public perception, the bridge of image. this importance of this bridge was either mentioned or implied in all of the previous presidential addresses to which i referred earlier. as you know, images are difficult to change, and to do so will take concerted effort on the part of all of us. some examples of speci c asa efforts in this direction include rejuvenating the scientific and public affairs advisory committee, looking for ways to restructure chance magazine so that it appeals to a broader group of readers, and working with aaas to improve the statistical quality of science. the many joint committees formed over the years with other associations and government agencies have made positive contributions to our image, and continue to do so. but this bridge of public perception may simply be the amalgam, the joint network, of all the bridges mentioned earlier. image building must begin at the school level, carry through the undergraduate and graduate levels, and become part of the formal and informal continuing education of users of statistics through the conscientious efforts of those of us who practice statistics as a profession. in other words, we must be vigilant in the protection and promotion of our image at every turn. the public is fascinated, even mesmerized, by events of a statistical nature—for example, the “hot hand” in sports and the belief that accidents come “in threes.” the word “mesmerize” itself has an interesting history that touches on the very statistical issues being addressed here. franz mesmer, a german physician of the late 1700s, held the theory that a  fluid, called animal magnetism,  owed through all organisms and that disease resulted from an interruption of this  ow (gould 1991). of course, he could restore the  ow for a fee. mesmerism became quite a popular cult in paris (lafayette was a devotee) until a commission was formed to investigate the increasingly outlandish claims. on the commission, among other well known scientists and doctors of the day, were benjamin franklin and antoine lavoisier, one of the great scientists of all time. in short, the commission designed and carried out some experiments that led to the debunking of mesmerism, and the cult never flourished in america in spite of lafayette’s efforts. what a triumph of reason over emotionalism! would that we could inject more statistical thinking into similar scenarios today—from counts of ballots to claims of astrologers—to help the public see the benefits of sound quantitative reasoning. clear explanations of such examples in the media could go far to improve the public perception of statistics. oh, yes, i should  finish the story by telling you that another member of the french commission was a dr. guillotin, and that lavoisier died on the doctor’s most famous invention a few years later. one must always be careful when debunking popular myths. conclusions in short, statistics must be an island without being insular. of course, many of us can do our teaching, consulting, or research while remaining isolated on our own island, to our own amusement. but we might amuse ourselves right out of existence. statistics has too large a role to play to allow that to happen. we are a small group of professionals, perhaps too narrowly focused and too conservative in our approach to the world around us. perhaps we are too much like the scotsman, who when speaking of his wife said, “ i love that woman so much that sometimes i can hardly keep from telling her.” we must speak out boldly on the important issues of the day, issues that many of us feel passionately about. the great 19th century statistician, adolphe quetelet, called the statistician one of the guardian angels of a republic (walker 1945): the statistician keeps his  finger on the pulse of humanity, and gives the necessary warning when things are not as they should be. or, if you like a more poetic version, try t. s. eliot (eliot 1969): where is the knowledge we have lost in information? where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? from choruses from the rock keeping the pulse, giving warning, constructing knowledge that can lead to wisdom—these are our tasks, and our challenges. to fulfill these tasks, we must build bridges, remembering that bridges go from somewhere to somewhere (and back!), and there must be support on both sides. bridges are made for movement across, not stagnation upon. bridges are structurally sound enough to stand up to wind and waves. happy bridge building!",264,22.6401515151515,5.02593274217835,0.267525514472143,5977,1599,17.9287004159886,12.9287004159886,29,1.62065881376529,"https://doi.org/10.1198/016214502753479176"

critical role in influencing the paths along which technology will take our society. but taking on this role requires changing our discipline, our profession, and our asa. change, however, is not an option; if we do not change, then technology may force change on us in detrimental ways. understanding how to change requires a broader view of statistics as a human activity with a human purpose that must evolve within a social, or human, system. considered as a technology, statistics is a fundamental and invaluable part of the infrastructure of other sciences. statistics advances discoveries in other sciences. universities and foundations must encourage interdisciplinary research as a primary contribution to our  field. our curricula must reflect modern approaches that other sciences require, and students with quantitative talents must be attracted from other disciplines. statistics should permeate the mathematics curricula at all elementary and secondary levels, and all children should understand variability and uncertainty, how to make sense from data, and the elements involved in making decisions. in industry, we must capitalize on the importance of quality improvement programs to further contributions of statistics. from government, we need timely and accurate statistics that are relevant to the world of the future as well as to today. in particular, we must commit ourselves now to changing our 40 year old poverty measure and improve access to government statistics with different and stronger ways to protect confidentiality. we must work toward a comprehensive, integrated network of knowledge and information systems for research on individual, social, and organizational change and for decision making by individuals, organizations, and public policy makers at all levels—local, regional, and national. in all of these directions, the asa must foster and encourage change and, in many cases, lead the way. with the commitment and perseverance of our next generation, statistics can become a leader in the advancement of science and technology to promote human welfare. key words: statistical association; government statistics; interdisciplinary research; statistics curricula; statistics education; technological change. author’s note: the following is the text of my speech to the statistical association at the joint statistical meetings in new york on august 13, 2002. it is included here as delivered—unrevised and unexpurgated. 1. an era of technological change the theme of our meeting this year is statistics in an era of technological change. we are fortunate to be alive in this era, to experience the changes brought by new technology— information, communications, biotechnology, and others—and to anticipate the changes that we will surely experience from new technologies, some heretofore unimaginable. these new technologies will bring many benefits to our lives. but they also will bring risks. transportation technology has brought us closer together and enabled a global economy. but it has also brought terrorism to our shores. information and communications technologies have dramatically increased our productivity and expanded our outreach. but our greater reliance on them for economic transactions, health care, transportation, electric power distribution, and communications leads to the risks of greater consequences from widespread failures in these complex, critical systems. biotechnology can enable us to feed the world, but at the same time increases the risks to our environment and sources of food. genetics promises new medical therapies and a longer lifespan, but it also raises a host of ethical issues, including embryo selection and gene replacement, and portends a loss of privacy of information on our own destiny. today we are on the verge of even greater technological change from nanotechnology, robotics, cybernetics (including chips implanted into the human nervous system that can communicate with computers and give us superhuman abilities), and, likely before this decade is out, the ability to determine an individual’s genetic sequence overnight. take nanotechnology, for example. with the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules, it will be possible to build machines on the scale of human cells or to create new materials having properties that could not be developed with traditional chemistry. among the expected breakthroughs are quantum computers that can calculate millions—if not billions—of times faster than today’s fastest supercomputers, artificial photosynthesis for clean energy, and human organ restoration using synthetic tissue. nanotechnology could lead to lighter, faster, less polluting, and safer transportation vehicles. it could improve medicine, agricultural yields, desalination, and water  filtration and enable highly efficient solar energy conversion. can you begin to imagine the many ways in which statistics can contribute to advancing this technology? from research today on this and other frontiers will come technologies that will forever change our lives. they can bring bountiful wonders, but they also can bring increased risks, disruptions to our society, and even the malevolence of war. 2. a critical role for statistics my message to you today is that we, as statisticians, can play a critical role in influencing the paths along which technology will take our society. but it will require us to change— to change our discipline, to change our profession, and to change our asa. why is it that statistics can play such a critical role? all sciences play a role in technological development. but our discipline is special, not only because it advances discoveries across the breadth of scientific disciplines and advances the development of technologies, but also because it has an important connection to the human side of scientific and technological development. how the needs of our society are measured and articulated, how our businesses and industries respond to those needs with technological developments, how our markets and our political and legal institutions encourage or impede technologies, and how we as a society employ technology and deal with its unintended consequences—these human activities have as much to do with advancing a technology’s contributions to society as does the development of the technology itself. statisticians are engaged in all of these aspects of technological development. asa members come from educational and research institutions, laboratories and think tanks, businesses and industry, and government organizations at all levels—local, state, and national. we work in all scientific disciplines—the physical, natural, biological, life, and health sciences and, especially relevant to this challenge, the social and behavioral sciences. we engage in scientific research and its application through engineering and medical practice, and we inform government policies affecting our society. you see these different aspects represented here among yourselves and, in particular, among the fellows whom we have just honored. for these reasons, i argue that there is no discipline better suited than statistics to play a leadership role in confronting the challenges of technological change. but our doing so will require us to change. 3. change is not an option: the world in 2020 i put it to you, however, that change for us is not an option. technology and its interaction with social, political, and economic factors will force change upon us. suppose we as a profession do not change our ways while the world around us changes. imagine, then, our world in the year 2020. it is a world without walls. geography no longer de nes where people work, where they learn, or where they transact business. generation iii of the internet is the medium for education, decentralized work, and global commerce. education is individualized and continues throughout the lifespan. academic statisticians develop and sell distance learning courses that universities underwrite for a percentage of the profits. but the universities compete with  rms attracted by the lucrative market. the largest provider of statistics courses is michael milken’s knowledge universe. many statistics courses are centered around proprietary software. faculty want to teach other approaches, but know their students, on graduation, will sit for the certi cation exam in msp—the microsoft statistical package. the available pool of talent for students in statistics has dwindled, as those with technical abilities are drawn off to computer science and other  fields. departments in other disciplines teach their own statistics courses tailored to their discipline and customized to the individual student. many universities have dissolved their departments of statistics. in the past, foreign students  filled the talent gap for most statistics departments. but with today’s technology, foreign students can obtain a  first rate education without leaving their home country. stanford has affiliated with the national taiwan university to provide distance learning in statistics with interactive web based classrooms for its students. printed journals have now completely given way to online journals, which provide timely access to current research. many statistics journals offer immediate publication without peer review. the most popular journal articles are comparative reviews of software and other statistical tools. zagat publishes a monthly review of statistical software. with air travel unsafe and unnecessary, statisticians have developed web based alternatives to large association meetings. in many statistics specialties, strong communities have formed around virtual meetings. on the  first tuesday of every month, the data mining association broadcasts, over the internet, lectures or tutorials on recently developed methods. the statistics discipline is fragmented into highly specialized  fields. individual statisticians have loyalty not to a profession, but rather to their own marketable skills, tools, knowledge, and experience. they have little knowledge or appreciation of work outside their specialty. as government has focused on national security, support of basic research in statistics has been left mostly to the private sector. unencumbered by many former regulations, businesses are now engaged in nontraditional areas, such as managing social security and, this year, with advanced communications technology, taking the decennial census. such a future is unlikely, but there are many plausible elements to it. colleagues, if we do not change, then technology may change us in some of these and other ways that may be detrimental to our profession. but, how should we change? to begin with, we must accept a different, broader view of statistics. 4. what is statistics? many of our leaders have sought to define statistics, leaving us a legacy of countless definitions. from the variety of perspectives reflected in these definitions, one might conclude that statisticians do not even agree on what statistics is. but we do generally agree on the elements that it comprises: data; variability; uncertainty; sources of error; conceptualizing and quantifying phenomena; empirical inquiry through experiments, surveys, observational, and other studies; extraction and summary of information; inferences; and communication of results. i would like to share with you my personal definition of statistics through what i believe are its very purposes: to increase our understanding, to promote human welfare, and to improve our quality of life and well being by advancing the discovery and effective use of knowledge from data. this statement defines statistics not as a body of methods nor a collection of data, but rather as an activity. statistics is the generation and effective use of knowledge from data—data with all their uncertainty, fallibility, and variability. 4.1 the human element the definition reflects the human elements of statistics. even if we pursue the science of statistics for its own sake, there is a purpose for doing so. that purpose is to increase our understanding, promote human welfare, and improve the quality of our lives. we must  first acknowledge that statistics has a human purpose. another human element is that statistics and the scientific and technological discoveries it helps to spawn must evolve within a social system—a human system. if these discoveries are to promote human welfare, they must interact with our social framework—our political, economic, legal, and other social institutions and our systems of laws, property rights, regulations, and government policies. let us not forget a third human element. statistics is a human activity. as humans, we are fallible. in particular, we are influenced by personal and social attitudes and values. to moderate that in uence, we must commit ourselves to the scientific values of excellence, peer review, fairness, balance, openness, sharing data, verification by others, objectivity, honesty, and integrity. we must understand the suppositions and beliefs behind our work and make explicit our assumptions. 4.2 statistics as infrastructure for other sciences “statistics,” michael healy (1978, p. 385) says, “may itself best be considered as a technology rather than as a science.” i agree. as a technology, statistics is a fundamental and invaluable part of the infrastructure of other sciences. for example, last year three astrophysicists published in science a confirmation of the “big bang” theory of the creation of the universe (miller et al. 2001; miller, nichol, and batuski 2001). they studied the imprint of so called “acoustic oscillations” on the distribution of matter in the universe today and showed that it was in concordance with the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe. this work not only provided support for the “big bang” theory, but also provided an understanding of the physics of the early universe that enabled predictions of the distribution of matter from the microwave background radiation forward and backward in time. the discovery was made with a new statistical method, the false discovery rate, for detecting the oscillations. the method was adapted through collaboration with computer scientists and with statisticians larry wasserman and chris genovese. using this method, the team was able to make its discovery and publish it in science while others were still plowing through the plethora of data. statisticians are improving the statistical method and using it in the analysis of microarrays in statistical genetics and in other applications. as this example illustrates, statistics advances discoveries in other sciences. statisticians develop methods for particular applications and are equipped, as healy says, “to discern that the methodological barrier blocking progress in one  field of application has already been scaled in another” (healy 1978, p. 392). this year, c. r. rao was honored by our president with the national medal of science. we all are proud that a statistician was so recognized. rao’s citation refers to the impact of his work on the physical, biological, economics, and engineering sciences, showing the importance given to statistics for enriching other sciences. 5. statistics in academia this view of statistics, of advancing the discovery and use of knowledge from data, especially in other sciences, has important implications for our three sectors: academia, industry, and government. 5.1 interdisciplinary research the astrophysics discovery is an example of interdisciplinary research. many scientific questions, especially those with broader impacts to our society, do not fall within the boundaries of a single academic discipline. interdisciplinary research is the key to their investigation. statistics has the potential to significantly further the contributions of science and technology to society through interdisciplinary research. because it is so relevant to other sciences, statistics can serve as an integrative force among them. statisticians can build bridges and translate different disciplinary languages and perspectives into a common understanding about the data. but to develop statistics as a synergistic element in interdisciplinary research requires statisticians to become vital partners with other scientists and engineers. thus universities must encourage and reward, especially through promotion and tenure, the interactions of statisticians with scientists in other disciplines. quality cross disciplinary research must be looked on as a primary contribution to our  field. the national science foundation (nsf) should establish interdisciplinary programs in its research directorates that focus on data, measurement, and the development of statistical methods to advance their sciences. a model is the methodology, measurement, and statistics program in the directorate for social, behavioral and economic sciences. most statistics research at the nsf is managed through a program in the mathematical sciences, just like mathematical subdisciplines, as number theory and analysis. but statistics is no longer just a branch of mathematics. computer and information technologies are replacing mathematics as the foundation for more and more statistics research. at the very least, the nsf should establish a division for statistics research that is separate from mathematics. 5.2 the next generation of statistical methods especially in this era of technological change, if statistics is to advance discovery in other sciences, we need to also apply the next generation of statistical methods. leo breiman (2001, p. 199) described two cultures of our  field: one assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. the other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. the statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. this commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. p. k. sen, this year’s recipient of our prestigious noether award, describes the new frontier of statistics as dealing with highly nonstandard problems: “the wealth of statistical tools and concepts developed during the past six decades,” he concludes, “may be of very limited use in this new  field : : : we need to address our curricula, train our teachers, and motivate and organize our training programs to promote better understanding and interaction of statisticians: : : with other scientists : : : ” (sen 2002, p. 11). unless we change our culture and unless we change the curricula we teach to reflect the more modern approaches that other sciences require, then our contributions to advancing our society through science and technology will be marginal at best. but even more is at stake. we stand to lose our students, jobs, and our own statisticians to other, more exciting dataoriented sciences. if data analytic techniques become dominant in other  fields, traditional statistics departments may become unnecessary. driven by the plethora of new forms of data, statistical practice will explode, but our profession may implode. if we are to change our culture and our curricula, as i believe we have to do, then  first we must, as jerry friedman (2001, p. 9) put it, “moderate our romance with mathematics.” we must recognize, especially in applications to other sciences, that empirical corroboration may advance discoveries far more than theoretical, mathematical validation. beyond new curricula, we must inspire and teach our students to become partners in interdisciplinary research. that requires teaching them how to communicate with other scientists and engineers. 5.3 developing multiple pathways we need to attract from other disciplines students with quantitative talents. that requires developing multiple pathways to statistics. some students may then gravitate to statistics as a secondary degree, if not a primary one. more students may continue with a professional affiliation with statistics and influence future generations of students. we need to replace the  lter of mathematics by a funnel of statistics whereby anyone with quantitative talents can enter our  field from any scientific discipline or  field of engineering. those of you who teach service courses in statistics must treat these courses with no less care than you treat those for statistics majors. with these service courses, we either interest students in our field or turn them off. to attract more graduate students, we must promote and further develop statistics curricula for undergraduates. moreover, because community colleges are an increasingly popular and important pathway to professions and higher education, we must also see that their students have opportunities for quality statistics education. the most important pathway to interest students in statistics is k–12 education. statistics should permeate the mathematics curricula at all elementary and secondary levels. we must see that children understand variability and uncertainty, how to make sense from data, and the elements involved in making decisions. we must do so not just because the concepts are important to our profession, but also because they are important to our children in their future world. and we must see that all children learn them, because with high quality education, all children are capable of learning them. in these basic statistical concepts, we must see that no child is left behind. 6. statistics in industry the quality improvement program six sigma is an example of the importance of statistics being recognized at the upper echelons of management in industry. when he was chief executive officer of general electric (ge), jack welch sought to recruit ge’s best people in the program and foresaw those with the statistical six sigma training as dominating ge’s management. how can we capitalize on this newfound importance to further the contributions of statistics? first, we can recognize these programs in our own statistical community as important statistical applications. rather than critiquing them as fads, for their hype, or for their sometimes naive use of statistics, we should recognize their purposes and seek to improve the methods. we need to bring these programs as examples into our classrooms and encourage research on them. through its journals, meetings, and continuing education courses, asa could foster a community of statisticians to become or train others to become leaders in industry. in next month’s amstat news, roger hoerl (2002) discusses some of these and other methods to bring our discipline to bear on improving and advancing six sigma quality improvement and, at the same time, advancing the importance of statistics to technological development. 7. statistics in government if we are to advance our society through science and technology, we must understand the effects of the changes they bring through timely and accurate government statistics that are relevant to the world of today, let alone the future. throughout its 30 year history, the committee on national statistics at the national academy of sciences has worked to improve government statistics. from its many studies, two areas are, at least to me, most important and urgent: poverty and access to data. 7.1 the poverty measure next year will mark the 40th anniversary of the official poverty measure developed by mollie orshansky. we have been using effectively the same measure all these years. orshansky, using 1955 food consumption data, estimated that families of three or more spent about one third of their after tax income on food. taking the cheapest of four u.s. development of agriculture food plans that was designed for “temporary or emergency use when funds are low,” she multiplied the cost of that economy food plan by three to define the minimum annual income a family would need to remain out of poverty. the thresholds set then have been updated only for inflation. we are very different today from what we were in 1955. to begin with, we do not spend one third of our income on food. our standard of living has changed. yet we measure poverty as if nothing has changed, only that prices have gone up. our outdated poverty measure does not account for the expenses of child care that are essential for so many working mothers. it does not account for expenses of transportation needed to get to work. it uses a before tax definition of income to compare with thresholds developed on an after tax basis and thus does not account for the differential effect of tax policies on low income families. it does not distinguish among the health care needs of different families, and does not account for health insurance, which affects what families pay for health care. moreover, our outdated measure does not reflect the differences in costs of living in different areas of our country, most notably the cost of housing. among so much that we have today that we did not have when our poverty measure was developed are government and private programs that provide in kind and tax benefits to low income families—food stamps, housing, energy assistance, medicaid and medicare, and earned income tax credits. our outdated poverty measure reflects none of these. if we were to institute another program today, our poverty measure could not tell us if it were to have any effect. so how can we learn the effects of changes on the important consequence of poverty? do you think we would tolerate a consumer price index for today based only on those goods and services that we were buying in 1955? yet that is effectively what we do with the poverty measure. seven years ago, a committee on national statistics panel, having explored several approaches and criteria for a poverty measure, recommended revising the current one “to re ect more nearly the circumstances of the nation’s families and changes in them over time” (national research council 1995, p. 4). since then, the census bureau has been compiling and publishing several experimental measures. but the standard— the official u.s. measure of poverty—remains the same, stultified in a political quagmire. forty years is too long. we must commit ourselves now to changing the poverty measure. 7.2 access to data to understand the effects of technological change and to prepare for its consequences, we need access to government statistics that are increasingly being restricted to protect confidentiality. even government statistical agencies are restricted from obtaining data from other statistical agencies. different, stronger ways to protect confidentiality are needed. statistical agencies should lead in confidentiality research, in fostering legal and administrative means to protect confidentiality, and in broadening access for research and statistical purposes. we must respect respondents to our censuses and surveys by using the information they provide when it can bene t society. to begin with, we can stop thinking in terms of setting an absolute standard of zero risk of inferring information about an individual. because that risk is never zero, the obligation to protect confidentiality for government statistics must also be placed on all those who use them. 7.3 vision for government statistics if we are to use statistics to promote human welfare and advance the quality of our lives and well being, then we must be guided by a different vision for government statistics. this vision encompasses a comprehensive integrated network of knowledge and information systems for research on individual, social, and organizational change and for decision making by individuals, organizations, and public policy makers at all levels—local, regional, and national. 8. the statistical association i believe that all of the aforementioned changes are necessary if we are to contribute to the advancement of science, technology, and society in an era of technological change. some of them are necessary if we are to remain viable as a profession. we have lost positions of leadership in many  fields that have had their origins in statistics, including, quality improvement,  nance statistics, and machine learning and data mining, with their methods of pattern recognition and neural networks. and we have even lost leadership of k–12 statistics education. our asa cannot sit idly by as statisticians in academia continue to focus on graduate education and on extending the statistical methods of a past generation. we need to develop through our journals, our meetings, and our networks a broader statistical community—nationally and internationally—one that encompasses modern statistical practice that other sciences require. the asa must promote and reward interdisciplinary research; be proactive in developing multiple pathways to our profession; promote new journals, especially ones on emerging applications of statistics; and advance statistical practice in industry. the asa should foster statistics curricula for the future; encourage the development of undergraduate statistics programs, especially in community colleges; and seek the widespread adoption of statistical concepts as standards for k–12 mathematics education. the asa should speak out against the inadequacies of our government statistics, seek ways to improve them, and foster the legislative solutions we know are needed. finally, we, through the asa, must develop communities for different types of statistical research or practice, especially in such areas as six sigma or data mining, which we might otherwise lose. we must build these communities, not just through more sections, but also, more importantly, on the web. 9. the future my vision is of statisticians working together with scientists in other disciplines to increase their powers of observation; to further their abilities of measurement, analysis, and prediction; and to advance their discoveries and guide their responsible development into technologies that make a difference in people’s lives. the future of our discipline, our profession, and our asa are in the hands of our next generation. some of those among you here may embrace these changes and choose this road less traveled. the road is laden with risks. colleagues in your organizations may shun you. our compartmentalized academic institutions may not reward you. bureaucracies  fixed on self preservation may impede you. yet if you persevere, you will succeed in making statistics a leader in the advancement of science and technology to promote human welfare. i truly believe you are capable of achieving this goal, and i wish you godspeed. to all of you of any generation: if you share this vision, if you commit yourselves to this goal, may you come to feel, as i do, that there is no greater challenge nor higher calling than to be a statistician in service to science, technology, and society.",282,16.9929078014184,5.37458263772955,0.257512520868114,4792,1234,17.1871088338721,12.1871088338721,53,0.904401445451956,"https://doi.org/10.1198/016214503388619030"

Mason","2000-2020","the  field of statistics has numerous areas of application and many positive attributes. various companies and organizations around the world have chosen not only to adopt statistical tools, but also to integrate them into their associated work and ultimately into their decision making processes. consequently, the value of statistics as a quantitative tool of importance to society appears to be continually increasing. in contrast, statisticians are less visible to society, and their importance and necessity is not always as evident. this is a result of many factors, some tied to the statistics profession itself and others due to external causes that are not easily controlled. this address presents some basic ideas for improving the recognition of statistics as a profession and of statisticians as the profession’s core component. included is a discussion of ways to promote the recognition of the value of statisticians to society. in the first panel of an old peanuts cartoon, charlie brown says, “i learned something in school today. i signed up for folk guitar, computer programming, stained glass, art, shoemaking, and a natural foods workshop.” he continues, “i got spelling, history, arithmetic, and two study periods.” charlie’s friend says, “so, what did you learn?” charlie replies, “i learned that what you sign up for and what you get are two different things.” that same lesson can be applied too many events in our own lives. how often do our expectations and our experiences turn out differently? how often do we sign up for one thing and receive something entirely different? we might view our choice of statistics as a profession in the same way—namely, that it was one thing in graduate school when we signed up, but an entirely different thing when we joined the statistics work force. that was my experience in 1971 after i graduated with my ph.d. in statistics from southern methodist university. my family and friends all knew that i was a statistician, but few knew what that meant, and most had never heard of the statistics profession. in fact, my parents really wondered if there was a future in such an unknown  field. consequently, i spent as much time trying to promote statistics to others as i did trying to gain tenure at the university where i worked. however, this lack of recognition did not seem to bother too many of my colleagues, possibly because within my department it was well known that statistics was necessary, and everyone employed there mutually agreed that statistics was vital to them. in the late 1970s, after i started working at southwest research institute in san antonio, i experienced another unexpected reaction to statistics. my fellow workers, who now included engineers, chemists, and physical scientists, generally felt that statisticians were of limited use to them. especially foreign to them were the concepts that statistics could be beneficial to any experimenter and that statistical thinking was vital to understanding variation. mostly my coworkers and friends told humorous stories about how statistics was the most dreaded course they took in college. many acknowledged that they used statistics only when their clients mandated it, and they counted on me as someone who could “talk statistics” when it was necessary. fast forward to the present, and we see a tremendous change in society’s attitude toward statistics. the value of statistics is definitely recognized in almost every  field of study from astronomy to zoology. from kindergarten to college, increasing numbers of students are being introduced to the concepts of statistical thinking and of analytical approaches to summarizing and drawing inferences from data. it is commonplace to see kindergarten students using m&m’s to learn how to create a bar chart. this past year, more than 58;000 high school students took the advanced placement statistics examination to obtain college credit for statistics while still in high school. many companies offer training courses in statistics to business, government, and industry. these courses generally are well received and attended. all of this is aided by an extensive array of computer software that quickly allows individuals who are minimally trained in statistics to perform statistical analyses with a single click of a mouse. a well founded fear, however, is that few of these individuals know much about the actual procedures that they are attempting to apply. as an example of the value of statistics, consider the environmental protection agency’s use of statistical models to predict the emissions levels of automobiles by sampling the fuel properties of gasoline sold at service stations. or consider the use of statistics to determine the efficacy of a new drug, to assess the merits of a new test procedure, to evaluate the ability of honeybees to detect land mines in unmarked areas, or to project property losses associated with hurricanes or earthquakes. in all of these endeavors there are many types of data analysts,  fields of applications, statistical societies, education levels in statistics, and types of statistical publications.but common to all of them is the statistics discipline. 2. the statistical association given the increasing recognition of the value of statistics, one might wonder if a similar need and appreciation is growing for statisticians.examining this issue leads one initially to question the existence of the necessary vision and leadership to guide professionals in statistics. such attributes generally come from statistical society leaders, academicians, industrial practitioners, and government employees in the  field of statistics. who unites all of these groups of statisticians? this is accomplished by various statistical societies, including the statistical association (asa), the institute of mathematical statistics, the international biometric society, the statistical society of canada, and others. of these, the asa is the oldest and largest society in north america. the asa had a very modest beginning, with only  ve men gathering together in boston, massachusetts, on november 27, 1839, to form the society. among these individuals was the  first asa president, richard fletcher. from this humble start, the association has grown to include more than 16,000 professionals in government, academia, and industry.education initiatives span from kindergarten to college, and statistical thinking is broadly promoted. in parallel, the  field of statistics has continued to evolve as a science and to expand into numerous application areas. it is being used by more and more data analysts, crossing and crisscrossing into other  fields to the point where its true identity has become somewhat fuzzy and distorted and no longer seems clearly visible. computers have greatly aided this process, making it easier to perform complex analyses and computations. the result is that statistics has become an inherent part of many other sciences and disciplines, several of which have subgroups that develop their own statistical practices. consider the following example. recently i was serving on a project team in my company that was evaluating the merits of an internal proposal for addressing the physical and chemical processes in comets and advancing understanding of the comet environment. in the presentation, reference was made to a new analytical tool that might have applications in space physics. this tool was to be used to sort through the various chemical elements that constitute comets to determine which ones are most prevalent or important, so these could be included in computer models of comets. at the project meeting, the proposal presenters introduced a computer science professor from a local university who spoke about using a new analytical methodology that he was researching, termed “knowledge discovery and data mining” and described as a computer science tool. unfortunately, this presentation contained no mention of statistics. despite such challenges, the asa has adapted to the changes occurring around it and continues to maintain its uniqueness while growing in new directions. its vision statement remains applicable: to be a world leader in promoting statistical practices, applications, and research; publishing statistical journals; improving statistical education; and advancing the statistics profession. a good example of this responsiveness is in the recent creation of the asa center for statistics education and the asa’s efforts to produce programs to meet the education needs of society. this year, the asa hired a new assistant director, who is charged with unifying and promoting statistics education in kindergarten through college (k 16). advanced placement courses in statistics continue to increase, as do the number of educators teaching statistics in the elementary grades. other examples of new directions for the asa are its ongoing efforts to convert asa publications to electronic format, to introduce on line journals, and to  find faster and more efficient methods of publishing and distributing its journals. these changes have had a positive effect on the asa and its members. the asa remains a world leader in the statistics  field, and is an organization that statisticians can count on for innovation in statistical applications. this growth is directly attributable to the vision and work of the asa’s leaders and volunteers, to good statistical research by its members, and to the varied and novel applications introduced by the many users of statistics. 3. are statisticians having an identity crisis? let us now turn our attention to individual statisticians. a phenomenon that continues to create challenges for the statistics profession is the ease with which data can be collected in various studies and experiments. there seems to be much more data available today than yesterday, and thus much more of a need for someone to analyze and interpret them. a good example is the investigation into the columbia space shuttle accident that occurred on february 1, 2003. it took weeks to decipher the data and to provide adequate imagery from the many pictures of the rocket (fig. 1). further, it took extensive testing to determine whether the piece of foam insulation that broke away from the external fuel tank during the shuttle’s launch actually damaged the leading edge of its left wing (see caib report, 2003). this testing in turn involved the collection of a tremendous amount of data, all of which required detailed analysis. nasa had to count on many analysts to draw conclusions from all of the collected data. this raises the key question of what should be the statistician’s role in such situations. several past asa presidents have considered this problem, and each has sought different solutions. don marquardt discussed the importance of statisticians and what role they needed to take to maintain their autonomy (marquardt 1987). he suggested that statisticians be purveyors of the scienti c method and that each statistician, especially the applied statistician, develop a self image of an entrepreneur in statistics. stu hunter discussed statistics as a full  fledged profession, and targeted certification as a means of protecting the wholeness of the profession. he also made some dire comments about what to expect if we failed to adopt certification: but what of those many young able people for whom the title “statistician” can today be mistaken for someone sleepily counting sheep? will society at large have any greater respect for these individuals at the close of the next decade? richard gunst, a well respected statistician who serves as chair of the department of statistical science at southern methodist university, sent me an updated version of this forecast in response to a recent request to describe the challenges facing academic departments in statistics. he stated: the greatest crisis facing the statistics profession in academics today is its identity. asa has wrestled with this a number of times over the last several decades. at one time there was a push for certification. the fact that nothing has been done is a testimony to the lack of an identity for statisticians. the common thread in these statements is that problems exist in communicating and maintaining the role of statisticians in society. each of us is called to nurture the health of the statistics profession. this can be done in many different ways, including outreach, interaction with society at large, and willingness to be a spokesperson for the profession. along the way, it seems to have become common for the governing bodies of statistical associations to want to be “inclusive” of everyone doing data analysis. in the statistics  field there is room for all, regardless of origin or style, and we should definitely try to be inclusive, but doing so raises the questions of whether we have failed to take a stand for what it means to be a professional statistician and whether this desire to be inclusive is indirectly leading to a loss of our identity as statisticians. consider the challenges now facing academic departments of statistics. our graduate statistics programs are the lifeblood of our profession. however, in the past year several chairs of academic departments of statistics have expressed concerns about student recruitment to these programs. in particular, the chairs have noted that they are losing domestic students at an alarming rate in their programs. this problems has several facets. many blame the situation on the job market, and on the fact that people can be successful with only a master’s degree. others point to the fact that statistics tends to be a low profile discipline, particularly at the undergraduate level, and hence the student does not have much time to build technical expertise. could a lack of a true identity for statisticians be the cause of these problems? what does this lack of identity bode for the future of statistics departments? consider the fact that funding for basic research in statistics is virtually unavailable at many research universities and institutions. instead, funding is oriented almost totally toward problem solving using advances in technology.as an example, consider the  field of medical imaging using computed tomography to probe the brain and discover differences in functioning. the statistical issues that need to be addressed in this area are many and complex—and they are fundable. however, physicists, medical doctors, and epidemiologists are doing the statistics work, much of it at the level of t tests, and are receiving most of the funding. in contrast, statisticians are not involved in most of that work and thus receive little or no funding. again, there is an apparent identity crisis. this problem is a serious one for statisticians and leads many to pursue work in areas within the statistics  field where the identity crisis is not so severe. for example, today biostatisticians are in great demand, with relatively plentiful job opportunities. departments of biostatistics seem to receive plenty of research funding and have uni ed targets of opportunity.in addition, because biostatisticians have a relatively well de ned job description, their curriculum includes subjects unique to their area. all of these factors help reduce the inclusiveness embedded in the biostatistics title, and thus strengthens the identity of biostatisticians. how can we remove this identity problem for statisticians? ron iman, in his asa presidential address (iman 1995), looked outside the profession to perception, preparation, and promotion (the “three p’s,” as he labeled them). he suggested that statisticians needed to improve perception by others by conveying a sense of the value of statistics to them, improve preparation by more carefully evaluating how we train professional statisticians and form partnerships between academia and industry, and continually promote ourselves by outreaching to society at large. in a more recent asa presidential address, jonas ellenberg (2000) discussed the need to increase the recognition of the statisticians’ importance by the general public as well as by other professionals.he suggested that statisticians promote the worth of their input and pay more attention to the simple elements of presentation and communication. he placed the responsibility for increasing the recognition of statisticians directly on each individual in the profession. these comments are very pertinent and definitely on target. it follows from these remarks that to overcome this identity crisis, statisticians need to be more de nitive about who they are and what they do in their jobs. as someone remarked at a recent asa chapter meeting, we must strive to eliminate the general public’s view that all that we do is record the statistics at sporting events. this can be accomplished in several ways, as i discuss next. 4. basic ingredients for addressing the identity crisis in may 2002, the national science foundation held a workshop on the future of statistics so that the statistics community could meet to assess the current status and needs of the  field (lindsay, kettenring, and siegmund 2003). the workshop drew approximately 50 participants, mostly from universities and several from outside the united states. many prestigious statisticians presented their views about the future of statistics and what its goals should be over the next two decades. the recommendations made by this group included the following: ² promote understanding of statistical science. ² strengthen the core of statistics research. ² develop new models for statistics education. accelerate the recruitment of the next generation. each of these recommendations requires work by statisticians, along with appropriate funding to make it happen. the asa has implemented initiatives in at least two of these areas. first, as mentioned earlier, the asa is building an impressive center for statistics education. developing new models for statistics education is a natural outgrowth of several of the related asa education committees. second, the asa has recently hired a membership consultant and reorganized its membership committee in an effort to increase the recruitment and retention of statisticians. asa’s current emphasis is on recruiting students in the hope that these student members will naturally want to stay in the profession when they graduate and become the statisticians on whom we can count in the future. reviewing these areas of concern, one also might question what statisticians are doing to prepare to face such future challenges. can we  nd the path to retained importance, increased professional recognition, and improved perception by others? more important, how do we preserve our uniqueness as statisticians given the many overlaps of statistics with other  fields? perhaps part of the answer to these questions lies in knowing and understanding what separates us from other professionals, and using this as a selling point for our profession. one of my colleagues has suggested that statisticians think differently than their nonstatistical colleagues. is this really true? most of us would probably say “no.” for example, we have many common characteristics with engineers. we are both problem solvers and to a certain extent model builders, although we use different sets of tools. engineers are usually  first principle oriented, whereas statisticians are data oriented. however, statisticians are expected to have analytical capabilities. nonetheless, i have noticed several differences between engineers and statisticians and i believe that these disparities are what make the statisticians unique. one difference is in the way in which we view and analyze data that are collected simultaneously on many related variables. as mentioned earlier, we have the ability to rapidly collect data on many variables for very complicated processes. many of my engineering colleagues usually view the data one variable at a time, as if the variables are all independent, but all that they are able to see is the deviation in the individual variable. locating the source of their engineering problems becomes very difficult, because the deviation in each individual variable can be very small. from experience and training, statisticians tend to examine variables simultaneously using multivariate methods, because these methods can be used to extract information on how all of the variables are behaving relative to one another. this type of multivariate thinking is foreign to most other disciplines but common to statisticians due to our training and experience. another important difference is that statisticians have the ability to see the entire problem and how the various parts  t together. statisticians do not need to be convinced to run a test program here or a design there; they know where these things need to be done and how to integrate them into a program to make it more cost effective and produce a better outcome. someone trained in a specific  field of study will likely not have this perspective. thus statisticians can easily assume the role of leadership on projects. what a great way to establish an identity! this is one of the reasons why we need to train statisticians to have broad backgrounds, preferably in science, and strong presentation and communication skills, areas often ignored in our training. currently our training is too technical, and we are all happy to survive it. however, our survival in the real world depends greatly on our ability to communicate and promote statistics after we leave school. in response to the need to promote our statistical identity to ensure the long term survival of our profession, i have compiled a list of a few suggested practices: develop communication skills. communications is an essential component of statistics but is seldom, if ever, taught in statistics education. companies often have to teach new graduates in statistics how to write, make presentations, and communicate with their fellow researchers, especially in a nonstatistical manner. improvement in this area would help us all. ² be more proactive with our knowledge. sharing our knowledge with others is admirable, but we need to be more aggressive in demonstrating that we are the source of this knowledge and continue to develop it to meet the needs of others. our image in academics is moderately strong, but we need to continue to seek opportunities to show our academic strengths to others. ² retain our core values. our core values center on education, research, and solving real problems by applying existing statistical methods, adapting existing methods, and developing new methods. each of us is often charged with teaching others about statistics, doing research on new topics in our  field, or applying statistical methods to the solution of problems. we need to emphasize these aspects in describing our own work and more closely identify our profession with these traits. statisticians routinely make invaluable contributions that improve products, conserve resources, save money, and make fundamental contributions to society. yet as important as these contributions are, we have few mechanisms for publicizing these valuable contributions. we need to publicize these results to society. we should continue to encourage interactions with other disciplines, such as those in medicine, biology, engineering, and physical sciences. making presentations at conferences of other societies can have a great impact. asa sections often use their talents and treasuries to promote statistics to asa members working in individual application areas, but the sections might also assist by enhancing the opportunities for these statisticians to interact with professional societies that share similar interests. opportunities for outreach occur daily. for example, earlier this year stu hunter asked the asa to look at working with the accreditation board for engineering & technology to act on a recent recommendation of the national research council that statistics should be required in undergraduate engineering programs. this type of outreach requires volunteer help, and, when applicable, each of us needs to be willing to respond to such requests and to participate in the activity. chapters have been highly successful in outreach efforts through such activities as judging science fairs and promoting statistics careers to high school students. our colleagues need continued encouragement and support to increase these types of activities. further the role of statistics in public policy. statisticians need to become better advocates of statistics, particularly in public policy matters. the asa has a very active advisory committee on scientific and public affairs that has proposed many good ideas in this area, including convening communications experts to advise the asa on effective ways to promote the discipline in the areas of communications and interacting with the media. what is now needed is the funding to devote to these efforts and the key volunteers to lead them. broaden the statistics community. we need to recruit more segments of data users, such as master’s degreed statisticians; those in  fields with little asa support, such as statistical programmers; and those in large user  fields, such as biostatistics.there is a great need to recruit more students into our graduate programs and to continue to encourage and attract more minorities and women to the  field of statistics. it would also be beneficial to expand the asa to include more international members. but in all these efforts we must be sure to identify the role of statisticians and maintain their unique identity. further the work in statistics education. we need to continue building in the area of statistics education. a strong foothold has been gained in this  field, but the asa needs to maintain its current efforts and continue to expand, to ensure that other groups and societies do not dominate the  field and diminish our influence. the development of the center for statistics education needs to be a high priority at the asa for several more years, to bring many of the programs to fruition. there are surely many other ideas for promoting our identity as statisticians, but this list provides a useful illustration of areas that need to be addressed by both the profession as a whole and each of us. now is the time to take action! 5. a future glimpse in another old peanuts cartoon, snoopy deals with the identity issue. he thinks the following: “yesterday i was a dog. today i’m a dog. tomorrow i’ll probably still be a dog. sigh! there’s so little hope for advancement.”let’s hope this attitude never occurs among statisticians. dr. charles anderson, an engineering director at southwest research institute, was recently celebrating his department’s accomplishments in testing whether the foam insulation from the external fuel tank of the columbia space shuttle damaged the leading edge of its left wing (see fig. 2; walker and grosch 2003). a colleague asked him how he was able to respond so quickly to the unique request from nasa to perform these types of tests, given that they had never been done before and could not have been anticipated. his response was that it was virtually impossible to foretell such a future event, but that it was possible to anticipate opportunities in the future. he called such preparation “planned opportunism.”by that he meant that his department had been active for many years before this event planning their activities and research capabilities so that they would be in a position to respond to opportunities that they expected to be presented with by their clients. this same approach would be useful for statisticians. we need to be proactive in a similar way by anticipating the opportunities that may exist in the future for the statistics profession and building the capabilities within the organization so that we are ready to act on them. we also might gain by spending more time improving our identity as statisticians. the reality is that statisticians have many unique traits, but these generally remain hidden from society. it reminds me of the story of an artist who painted a door with no handle; the artist’s message was that one must open the door from inside to let others see what is there. maybe this is the problem with statisticians and statistics in general. we had better start opening that door and letting others see what we do, or else no one will know that we exist. we must outreach to others at all levels so that our talents can be seen. as richard scheaffer described in his asa presidential address, we must become bridge builders and work at connecting society to the statistics profession. will the statistics profession continue to exist for the next 50 years? will statisticians expand their influence and help guide a multitude of new users, or will the profession shrink to a small core of basic researchers? when we ask ourselves what is really important in our lives, several things immediately come to mind, such as religion, family, or friends. somewhere down the list is a place for our profession. the challenge is in continuing to develop with it, and not be left behind. we must be willing to grow, to learn new skills, and to interact with others. statistics definitely gives us the opportunity to develop as leaders, to assume responsibility for our work, and to use statistical tools to provide new knowledge to society. we must in turn preserve its identity as well as our own. on january 20, 1981, ronald reagan took the oath of office for president of the united states. i would like to quote from the end of his inaugural address, because it  fits our current situation quite well: the crisis that we are facing today does not require of us the sacri ce that so many thousands have been called on to make. it does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with god’s help we can and will resolve the problems that confront us.

Scientists",2004-08-10,"Bradley Efron","2000-2020","﻿ broadly speaking, nineteenth century statistics was bayesian, while the twentieth century was frequentist, at least from the point of view of most scientific practitioners. here in the twenty first century scientists are bringing statisticians much bigger problems to solve, often comprising millions of data points and thousands of parameters. which statistical philosophy will dominate practice? my guess, backed up with some recent examples, is that a combination of bayesian and frequentist ideas will be needed to deal with our increasingly intense scientific environment. this will be a challenging period for statisticians, both applied and theoretical, but it also opens the opportunity for a new golden age, rivaling that of fisher, neyman, and the other giants of the early 1900s. what follows is the text of the 164th asa presidential address, delivered at the awards ceremony in toronto on august 10, 2004. two septembers ago, there was a conference of particle physicists and statisticians at stanford, called phystat2003. i gave a talk at phystat2003 titled “bayesians, frequentists, and physicists.” earlier that year i’d spoken to a meeting of biomedical researchers at the “hutch” in seattle, under the title “bayesians, frequentists, and microbiologists.” these weren’t the same lectures, and both were different than tonight’s talk, but you can see that i’ve gotten stuck on a naming scheme. you might worry that this has gotten out of hand, and next week it might be almost anything else that ends in “ists.” but no, there is a plan here: the common theme i’ve been stuck on, and what i want to talk about tonight, is the impact of statistics on modern science and also the impact of modern science on statistics. statisticians, by the nature of our profession, tend to be critical thinkers, and that includes a big dose of self criticism. it is easy to think of statistics as a small struggling field, but that’s not at all what the historical record shows. starting from just about zero in 1900, statistics has grown steadily in numbers and, more importantly, in intellectual influence. the growth process has accelerated in the past few decades as science has moved into areas where random noise is endemic and efficient inference is crucial. it’s hard to imagine phystat1903, back when physicists scorned statistical methods as appropriate only for soft noisy fields like the social sciences. but physicists have their own problems with noise these days, as they try to answer questions where data are really thin on the ground. the example of greatest interest at phystat2003 concerned the mass of the neutrino, a famously elusive particle that is much lighter than an electron and may weigh almost nothing at all. the physicists’ trouble was that the best unbiased estimate of the neutrino mass was negative, about −1 on a scale with unit standard error. the mass itself can’t be negative of course, and these days they’re pretty sure it’s not zero. they wished to establish an upper bound for the mass, the smaller the better from the point of view of further experimentation. as a result, the particle physics literature now contains a healthy debate on bayesian versus frequentist ways of setting the bound. the current favorite is a likelihood ratio based system of one sided confidence intervals. the physicists i talked with were really bothered by our 250 year old bayesian–frequentist argument. basically, there’s only one way of doing physics, but there seems to be at least two ways to do statistics, and they don’t always give the same answers. this says something about the special nature of our field. most scientists study some aspect of nature: rocks, stars, particles. we study scientists, or at least scientific data. statistics is an information science, the first and most fully developed information science. maybe it’s not surprising then that there is more than one way to think about an abstract subject like “information.” the bayesian–frequentist debate reflects two different attitudes about the process of doing science, both quite legitimate. bayesian statistics is well suited to individual researchers, or a research group, trying to use all of the information at its disposal to make the quickest possible progress. in pursuing progress, bayesians tend to be aggressive and optimistic with their modeling assumptions. frequentist statisticians are more cautious and defensive. one definition says that a frequentist is a bayesian trying to do well, or at least not too badly, against any possible prior distribution. the frequentist aims for universally acceptable conclusions, ones that will stand up to adversarial scrutiny. the fda, for example, doesn’t care about pfizer’s prior opinion of how well it’s new drug will work, it wants objective proof. pfizer, on the other hand, may care very much about its own opinions in planning future drug development. bayesians excel at combining information from different sources, “coherence” being the technical word for correct combination. on the other hand, a common frequentist tactic is to pull problems apart, focusing, for the sake of objectivity, on a subset of the data that can be analyzed optimally. i’ll give examples of both tactics soon. broadly speaking, bayesian statistics dominated nineteenth century statistical practice, while the twentieth century was more frequentist. what’s going to happen in the twenty first century? one thing that’s already happening is that scientists are bringing statisticians much bigger datasets to analyze, with millions of data points and thousands of parameters to consider all at once. microarrays, the thing i was talking about to the microbiologists in seattle, are the poster boy for scientific giganticism. classical statistics was fashioned for small problems, a few hundred data points at most and a few parameters. some new thinking is definitely called for on our part. i strongly suspect that statistics is in for a burst of new theory and methodology, and that this burst will feature a combination of bayesian and frequentist reasoning. tonight i’m going to argue that in some ways, huge datasets are actually easier to handle for both schools of thought. here’s a real life example i used to illustrate bayesian virtues to the physicists. a physicist friend of mine and her husband found out, thanks to the miracle of sonograms, that they were going to have twin boys. one day at breakfast in the student union, she suddenly asked me what was the probability that the twins would be identical rather than fraternal. this seemed like a tough question, especially at breakfast. stalling for time, i asked whether the doctor had given her any more information. “yes,” she said, “he told me that the proportion of identical twins was one third.” this is the population proportion, of course, and my friend wanted to know the probability that her twins would be identical. bayes would have lived in vain if i didn’t answer my friend using bayes’s rule. according to the doctor, the prior odds ratio of identical twins to nonidentical twins is one third to twothirds, or one half. because identical twins are always the same sex but fraternal twins are random, the likelihood ratio for seeing “both boys” in the sonogram is a factor of two in favor of identical twins. bayes’s rule says to multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to get the current odds; in this case 1/2 times 2 equals 1, or in other words, equal odds on identical or nonidentical given the sonogram results. so i told my friend that her odds were 50–50 (wishing the answer had come out something else, like 63–37, to make me seem more clever). incidentally, the twins are a couple of years old now and “couldn’t be more nonidentical,” according to their mom. now bayes rule is a very attractive way of reasoning, and fun to use, but using bayes rule doesn’t make one a bayesian. always using bayes rule does, and that’s where the practical difficulties begin. the kind of expert opinion that gave us the prior odds one third to two thirds usually doesn’t exist, or may be controversial or even wrong. the likelihood ratio can cause troubles too. typically the numerator is easy enough, being the probability of seeing the data at hand given our theory of interest, but the denominator refers to probabilities under other theories, which may not be clearly defined in our minds. this is why bayesians have to be such aggressive math modelers. frequentism took center stage in the twentieth century to avoid all of this model specification. figure 1 concerns a more typical scientific inference problem, of the sort that is almost always handled frequentistically these days. it involves a breast cancer study that attracted national attention when it appeared in the new england journal of medicine in 2001. his associates were studying two genetic mutations that each lead to increased breast cancer risk. these are different mutations on different chromesomes. wondered whether the tumors resulting from the two different mutations were themselves genetically different. to answer this question, hedenfalk et al. (2001) took tumor material from 15 breast cancer patients, 7 from women with the brca1 mutation and 8 from women with brca2. a separate microarray was developed for each of the 15 tumors, with each microarray having the same 3,226 genes. here we see the data only for the first gene: seven genetic activity numbers for the brca1 cases and eight activity numbers for the brca2 cases. these numbers don’t have much meaning individually, even for microbiologists, but they can be compared with each other statistically. the question of interest is whether the expression levels are different for brca1 and brca2. it looks like this gene might be more active in the brca2 tumors, because those eight numbers are mostly positive, whereas six of the seven brac1s are negative. a standard frequentist answer to this question uses wilcoxon’s nonparametric two sample test (which amounts to the usual t test except with ranks replacing the original numbers). we order the 15 expression values from smallest to largest and compute “w ,” the sum of ranks for the brca2 values. the biggest w could be is 92, if all eight brca2 numbers were larger than all seven brca1s; at the opposite end of the scale, if the eight brca2s were all smaller than the seven brca1s, we’d get w = 36. for the gene 1 data, we actually get w = 83, which looks pretty big. it is big by the usual frequentist criterion. its two sided p value, the probability of getting a w at least this extreme, is only 024 under the null hypothesis that there is no real expression difference. we’d usually put a star next to 024 to indicate significance, according to fisher’s famous 05 cutoff point. notice that this analysis requires very little from the statistician; no prior probabilities or likelihoods, and only the specification of a null hypothesis. it’s no wonder that hypothesis testing is wildly popular with scientists, and has been for 100 years. the 05 significance cutoff has been used literally millions of times since fisher proposed it in the early 1900s. it has become a standard of objective comparison in all areas of science. i don’t think that 05 could stand up to such intense use if it wasn’t producing basically correct scientific inferences most of the time. but 05 was intended to apply to a single comparison, not 3,226 comparisons at once. i computed w for each of the 3,226 genes in the brca microarray data. the histogram in figure 2 shows the results, which range from eight genes with the smallest possible w , w = 36, to seven genes with w = 92, the largest possible, and with all intermediate values represented many times over. (there’s more about the analysis of this data set in.) it looks like something is definitely going on here. the histogram is much wider than the theoretical wilcoxon null density (the smooth curve) that would apply if none of the genes behaved differently for brca1 and brca2. a total of 580 of these genes (18% of them) achieve significance according to the usual one at a time 05 criterion. that’s a lot more than the null hypothesis 5%, but now it isn’t so clear how to assess significance for any one gene given so many candidates. does the w = 83 that we saw for gene 1 really indicate significance? i was saying earlier that huge datasets are in some ways easier to analyze than the small ones we’ve been used to. here is a big dataset kind of answer to assessing the significance of the observed wilcoxon value w = 83. a total of 36 of the 3,226 genes (gene 1 and 35 others) have w = 83; under the null hypothesis that there’s no real difference between brca1 and brca2 expression, we would expect to see only 9 genes with w = 83. therefore, the expected false discovery rate is 9 out of 36, or 25%. if hedenfalk decides to investigate gene 1 further, he has a 25% chance of wasting his time. investigator time is usually precious, so he might prefer to focus attention on those genes with more extreme w values having smaller false discovery rates. for example, there are 13 genes with w = 90, and these have a false discovery rate of only 8%. the “9 out of 36” calculation looks definitely frequentist. in fact, the original false discovery rate theory developed by benjamini and hochberg in 1995 was phrased entirely in frequentist terms, not very much different philosophically than fisher’s 05 cutoff or neyman–pearson testing. their work is a good example of the kind of “new theory” that i hope statisticians will be developing in response to the challenge of massive datasets. it turns out that the false discovery rate calculations also have a very nice bayesian rationale. we assume that a priori a proportion p0 of the genes are null, and that these genes have w’s following the null wilcoxon density f0(w). in a usual microarray experiment, we’d expect most of the genes to be null, with p0 no smaller than, say, 90%. the remainder of the genes are nonnull and follow some other density, let’s call it f1(w), for their wilcoxon scores. these are the “interesting genes,” the ones that we want to identify and report back to the investigators. if we know p0, f0, and f1, then bayes’s rule tells us right away what the probability is of a gene being null or nonnull given its wilcoxon score w the catch is that to actually carry out bayes’s rule, we need to know the prior quantities p0, f0(w), and f1(w). this looks pretty hopeless without an alarming amount of prior modeling and guesswork. but an interesting thing happens with a large dataset like this one: we can use the data to estimate the prior quantities, then use these estimates to approximate bayes rule. when we do so, the answer turns out much the same as before, for example, null probability 9 out of 36 given w = 83. this is properly called an “empirical bayes” approach. empirical bayes estimates combine the two statistical philosophies; the prior quantities are estimated frequentistically to carry out bayesian calculations. empirical bayes analysis goes back to robbins and stein in the 1950s, but they were way ahead of their time. the kind of massively parallel datasets that really benefit from empirical bayes analysis seem to be much more a twenty first century phenomenon. the brca dataset is big by classical standards, but it is big in an interesting way; it repeats the same “small” data structure again and again, so we are presented with 3,226 similar two sample comparisons. this kind of parallel structure gives the statistician a terrific advantage, just what we need to bring empirical bayes methods to bear. statisticians are not passive observers of the scientific scene. the fact that we can successfully analyze anova problems leads scientists to plan their experiments in anova style. in the same way we can influence the design of big datasets by demonstrating impressively successful analyses of parallel structures. we have a natural advantage here. it’s a lot easier to manufacture high throughput devices if they have a parallel design. the familiar medical breakthrough story on tv, showing what looks like a hundred eyedroppers squirting at once, illustrates parallel design in action. microarrays, flow cytometry, proteomics, time of flight spectroscopy all refer to machines of this sort that are going to provide us with huge datasets nicely suited for empirical bayes methods. figure 3 shows another example. it concerns an experiment comparing seven normal children with seven dyslexic kids. a diffusion tensor imaging scan (related to fmri scanning) was done for each child, providing measurements of activity at 16,000 locations in the brain. at each of these locations, a two sample t test was performed comparing the normal and dyslexic kids. the figure shows the signs of the t statistics for 580 of the positions on a single horizontal slice of the brain scan. (there are 40 other slices with similar pictures.) squares indicate positive t statistics and x’s indicate negative t statistics, with filled in squares indicating values exceeding 2; these are positions that would be considered significantly different between the two groups by the standard 05 one at a time criterion. we can use the same false discovery rate empirical bayes analysis here, with one important difference: the geometry of the brain scan lets us see the large amount of spatial correlation. better results are obtained by averaging the data over small contiguous blocks of brain position—better in the sense of giving more cases with small false discovery rates. the best way of doing so is one of those interesting questions raised by the new technology. there’s one last thing to say about my false discovery rate calculations for the brca data: they may not be right! at first glance, the “9 out of 36 equals 25% false discoveries” argument looks too simple to be wrong. the 9 in the numerator, which comes from wilcoxon’s null hypothesis distribution, is the only place where any theory is involved. but that’s where potential trouble lies. if we only had data for one gene, say for gene 1 as before, then we would have to use the wilcoxon null, but with thousands of genes to consider at once, most of which are probably null, we can empirically estimate the null distribution itself. doing so gives far fewer significant genes in this case. estimating the null hypothesis itself from the data sounds a little crazy, but that’s what i meant about huge datasets presenting new opportunities as well as difficulties. i have to apologize for going on so long about empirical bayes, which has always been one of my favorite topics, and now at last seems to be going from ugly duckling to swan in the world of statistical applications. here is another example of bayesian–frequentist convergence, equally dear to my heart. figure 4 tells the unhappy story of how people’s kidneys get worse as they grow older. the 157 dots represent 157 healthy volunteers, with the horizontal axis their age and the vertical axis a measure of total kidney function. i’ve used the “lowess” curve fitter, a complicated sort of robust moving average, to figure 4. kidney function versus age for 157 normal volunteers, and lowess fit. summarize the decline of kidney function with age. the fitted curve goes steadily downward except for a plateau in the 20s. how accurate is the lowess fit? this is one of those questions whose answer has gone from hopeless to easy with the advent of high speed computation. a simple bootstrap analysis gives the answer in literally seconds. we resample the 157 points, that is, take a random sample of 157 points with replacement from the original 157 (so some of the original points appear once, twice, three times, or more and others don’t appear at all in the resample). then the lowess curve fitter is applied to the resampled dataset, giving a bootstrap version of the original curve. in figure 5 i’ve repeated the whole process 100 times, yielding 100 bootstrap lowess curves. their spread gives a quick and dependable picture of the statistical variability in the original curve. for instance, we can see that the variability is much greater near the high end of the age scale, at the far right, than it is in the plateau. the bootstrap was originally developed as a purely frequentist device. nevertheless, the bootstrap picture has a bayesian interpretation: if we could put an “uninformative” prior on the collection of possible age kidney curves, that is, a prior that reflects a lack of specific opinions, then the resulting bayes analysis would tend to agree with the bootstrap distribution. the bootstrap objective bayes relationship was pursued. this brings up an important trend in bayesian statistics. objectivity is one of the principal reasons that frequentism dominated twentieth century applications; a frequentist method like wilcoxon’s test, which is completely devoid of prior opinion, has a clear claim to being objective—a crucial fact when scientists communicate with their skeptical colleagues. uninformative priors, the kind that also have a claim to objectivity, are the bayesian response. bayesian statistics has seen a strong movement away from subjectivity and toward objective uninformative priors in the past 20 years. technical improvements, the computer implementation of markov chain monte carlo methods, have facilitated this trend, but the main impetus, i believe, is the desire to compete with frequentism in the domain of real world applications. whatever the reason, the effect has been to bring bayesian and frequentist practice closer together. in practice, it isn’t easy to specify an uninformative prior, especially in messy looking problems like choosing a possibly jagged regression curve. what looks uninformative enough often turns out to subtly force answers in one direction or another. the bootstrap connection is intriguing, because it suggest a simple way of carrying out a genuinely objective bayesian analysis, but this is only a suggestion so far. perhaps i’ve let my enthusiasm for empirical bayes and the bootstrap run away with the main point i started out to make. the bottom line is that we have entered an era of massive scientific data collection, with a demand for answers to large scale inference problems that lie beyond the scope of classical statistics. in the struggle to find these answers, the statistics profession needs to use both frequenstist and bayesian ideas, as well as new combinations of the two. moreover, i think this is already beginning to happen. which was the real point of my examples. a field like statistics has both an inside and an outside. the outside part faces our clients, the people who need answers to pressing statistical questions. my examples tonight concerned outside relationships with physicists, microbiologists, and brain researchers. one of the encouraging trends in statistics has been our increasing engagement with front line science. this came first to industry and government groups, and now is sweeping the universities. it has changed statistics department faculties, the type of students entering the field, the problems we work on, and the articles in our journals. the change is definitely for the better—we are a much healthier profession now than when i was a student in the 1960s. i find the microarray story particularly encouraging. first of all, biologists did come to us for answers to their difficult new inference problems. this is our reward for being helpful colleagues in the past, with all those anova, t tests, and randomized clinical trials that have become a standard part of biomedical research. second, statisticians have made a serious effort to again be of help, with some of us (although not me, i’m afraid) devoting enormous energy to learning the biologicalmedical background of microarray technology. most important, we actually have been of help. there has been definite progress made on microarray inference (a very small part of which i discussed this evening), with lots more on the way, i hope. microbiologists talk with other information scientists too, such as data miners, neural networkers, and bioinformatics people. it’s human nature to worry about competition like this. in fact, however, we have a positive regression coefficient with these “rival” fields. their enthusiastic energy is refreshing and contagious. they bring new data analytic ideas into our field, ideas that statisticians can then understand and explain in terms of basic inferential theory. many scientists are excellent probabilists, but in my experience only statisticians are trained in the kind of reverse thinking, from observed data back to possible models, necessary for inference. in other words, don’t worry about statistics going out of business from outside competition. if you do feel the need to worry, a better subject is our own production of useful new ideas. this relates to the “inside” of the statistics profession, the side that worries about the structure of statistical inference and how it can be extended. new ideas are the coin of the realm for an intellectual discipline. without them a field hollows out, no matter how successful it may be in terms of funding or public recognition. too much “inside” can be deadly for a field, cutting it off from the bigger world of science, as happened to mathematics in the twentieth century. statistics had an inside phase itself in the 1950s and 1960s, but that is definitely not today’s problem. in fact, i would give statistics at least passing grades for the production of genuinely useful new ideas, like empirical bayes and false discovery rates, and i believe that the next few decades should be particularly fertile ones for statistical innovation. sometimes (not very often), the planets align for some lucky discipline, which then blossoms with new ideas and breathtaking progress. microbiology is a perfect current example. the key there was a buildup of interesting questions concerning cellular processes, followed by new technology that enabled a much closer look at those processes in action. now the planets may be aligning for statistics. new technology—electronic computation—has broken the bottleneck of calculation that limited classical statistical theory. at the same time an onrush of important new questions has come upon us in the form of huge datasets and large scale inference problems. i believe that the statisticians of this generation will participate in a new age of statistical innovation that might rival the golden age of fisher, neyman, hotelling, and wald. finally, let me thank the association for the opportunity to serve as president, to speak here this evening, and to help honor our many deserving colleagues.",234,19.2094017094017,4.83870967741935,0.280533926585095,4495,1261,15.9312995921394,10.9312995921394,63,6.92715652350485,"https://doi.org/10.1198/016214505000000033"

Scheuren","2000-2020","﻿because this is a serious evening for me, my preparations started during the year (2004) before my presidency. one of the things i did was to look at all the speeches of the 99 previous presidents anyway, those available in the journal of the statistical association. i found them to be of great value and arranged to have several appear in whole or in part in the statistician history corner that i ran during 2003– 2006. because statistical association (asa) presidents after me and others might also find them useful, i put them on a website, which has the simple name www.asapresidentialpapers.info. you can reach that site directly or go through asa’s main website. incidentally, this paper will be added there in 2007. in the course of all that reading (and with some help from others—notably george cobb, david banks, and mary batcher, who are wiser), i began to think about how, in this speech, i could remind you tonight—as other presidents before me have and, presumably, after me, will of the many good ideas that have come from earlier eras, but that still pose challenges to our profession. during my presidency, i have begun conducting that follow up. naturally, my personality led me to add in a little more besides, albeit that was mainly emphasis. even someone with my energy level, though, cannot do everything, so i needed a theme. i decided to focus on the phrase in the statistical association (asa) mission statement that exhorts us to “use our discipline to enhance human welfare.” not coincidentally, that was one of the areas president savage talked about in 1984, in philadelphia, when he gave his, the 79th, asa presidential speech (savage 1985). (i was actually there. the room was not as well lit as it is this evening and i was a little bit sleepy. but still his words resonated. let me try to deepen his precedent by giving five examples.) 2. enhancing human welfare through volunteering the examples i’ll tell you about tonight cover a decade in time and span the globe: cambodia, 1994; switzerland, 1997; yugoslavia, 1999; afghanistan, 2002; and the united states, 2004. all involve my recent work on human rights. taken together, the five examples highlight the variety of the statistical work that is out there to do and illustrate some of its challenges. typically, there is virtually no money, even for expenses, and almost no time to plan the matter through fully. often, too, i have found myself working away from home, with limited computer and other resources (scheuren 2002). i offer these examples to lend a touch of concrete granularity to ideas about pro bono service, which, otherwise, might be far too abstract. if you ever saw deming run his famous red bead experiment, you would realize or remember that he only talked fritz scheuren is the 100th president of the statistical association. the presidential address usually appears in the march issue following the expiration of the term; this one is late. sallie keller mcnulty’s address will appear in the june 2007 issue. about what he had done himself, because he wanted to be very specific and concrete (deming 1986). i will do likewise and for the same reason. volunteering, of course, is a very personal undertaking; each asa member needs to make her or his own choice about whether, where, and how to give pro bono service. of course, my main reason for this talk is that, somehow, asa members need to find a way of acting not only as individuals but also together as a profession. this means taking on, as lawyers do, a pro bono obligation to use our discipline to enhance human welfare. what is it that volunteering can offer you? for me, there has nearly always been a personal connection to the work; then, often there is the professional challenge of doing something that stimulates growth; finally, i want my work to be in support of a human rights principle. thus, the three ps (forgive the excess of alliteration)—personal, professional, and principled—motivate my volunteer roles. often, in addition, i look for crisis, because often it is in crises that our profession may contribute most. what is it that we as a profession can offer to others through our volunteering? as data scientists we are professional listeners: we learn to listen to data before drawing conclusions; as collaborators and consultants we listen to other people. these habits are valuable at all times, but especially so in a crisis. our professional objectivity can bring enormous value by creating the stillness of a good listener, whether it is listening to data or to another human being. in that stillness, sometimes resolutions emerge that none of the participants thought possible beforehand. 2.1 cambodia, 1994: civilian casualties from land mines let me start with cambodia. below is a map of cambodia. some of you who are my age will remember this part of the globe very well, having watched maps like this every night on television during the vietnam war era. my formal initiation into pro bono work on human rights started not with this map but with a call from tom jabine in 1994. now, tom is much published in the human rights area (e.g., jabine and johnston 1992). though we have long been friends, he phoned “out of the blue” and asked what i was doing one weekend. could i come over and help? and, of course, one never says “no” to tom. there was to be an information gathering effort coordinated by the association for the advancement of science (aaas) to compile and evaluate the evidence about civilian casualties from land mines—casualties that continue even today, many years after the wars they were intended for have ended. we met that weekend, and my involvement began. most of those present at aaas seemed to be statisticians. notably, i met herb spirer there. at the time, herb was a professor at columbia university. he has long been at the center of international human rights efforts in the united states. forthrightly, it must be said, i did very little in the end; my main role was just to read a report for herb about land mines in cambodia. he wanted my opinion as to whether the information compiled made sense. and it did. (my father, by the way, was in world war ii, and he never fired a weapon during 3 years of combat. what he risked his life doing was clearing minefields in north africa, italy, and france. so, you see, i had a personal stake.) why was the reading of these reports important? because statisticians can provide objectivity to settings dominated by advocates, who may make statements from their hearts, making inferences that go beyond what the data support. as herb was to teach me over and over, in overstatement lies one of the major downfalls of advocacy. at aaas that saturday, there was a young woman present, whom i did not know. she seemed to be in charge. her name was jody williams, and she was later to get the nobel peace prize for this work (roberts and williams 1995). i really am proud of the involvement of so many asa members in helping her (even though, in my case, what i did was insignificant). one last point about tom jabine and herb spirer. i have interviewed both of them (scheuren 2007a). this was done in the excellent statistical science tradition started some years ago with ingram olkin (sampson 2007). plans for publishing those interviews and others that i have been doing in book form are reaching fruition, now that my asa presidential roles are winding down (brackstone and scheuren 2007). 2.2 switzerland, 1997: the “holocaust gold” case permit me to switch continents and time periods—to talk about switzerland for a minute. again a map has been provided. (it turns out that my family name scheuren could be originally from switzerland. it is a suisse–deutsch name. there is a swiss commune by that name, incidentally, but so small it is not on a map drawn at this scale.) in 1997, there was a civil case settled involving valuables stored by jews in swiss banks and never returned to survivors. the jews to whom the valuables belonged had all perished in the holocaust. the settlement was in the billions of dollars (e.g., eizenstat 2006). many of you may remember this from the newspapers. it was a legal landmark. what you probably did not know about this case is the role that a few statisticians played. how did that involvement start? once again, the phone rang. someone called me at ernst and young (e&y) and asked, “can you come up to new york city? the swiss bank has an office on fifth avenue in manhattan and is being sued by the state of new york, and we need you to take a look at some of their records.” incidentally, the state of new york had nexus for what came to be called the “holocaust gold case,” because the bank’s records were being kept partly in new york state and, also, as it turns out, in kansas. the swiss, because of world war ii, had sent a complete set of their records from that era to the united states; therein lay the reason the state of new york had standing to sue. wendy rotz, whom i believe is here tonight, worked with me, playing a key role, as did sarah dorn havlik. at the time, they were young e&y employees, but very, very good statisticians and economists. to give you a flavor of how thorough they were, i am going to tell a little story about wendy. the major source of swiss records in the u.s. was stored in salt mines in kansas, and wendy had to go down into the mine to check that all the paper, microfiche, and microfilm records required had been found. that was quite an experience for wendy. she was so insistent on making sure that everything had been done properly that she almost stayed too long—almost getting locked in over a weekend (where she would have had to spend the entire time in total darkness!). there are some nice little methodological wrinkles here, as well. those of you who are survey samplers may know something about what are called half open segments (hansen, hurwitz, and madow 1953). these can be used to overcome coverage issues in surveys. sarah and i made a small advance in their application, used since in my statistical work on indian trust records. of course, in the end, the swiss bank settled. if they had not, they probably would have lost the lawsuit. (trust me, i saw the work.) so rough justice was done, very late, but nonetheless, done. 2.3 yugoslavia, 1999: counting refugees and victims of violence the time advances 2 years, and it is 1999. i had been involved in other human rights projects in between, but was still just sitting behind a computer. kosovo was different—i had to “get out from the behind the desk,” as deming says, and play a direct role. in the map of yugoslavia, the kosovo portion is highlighted. you all, i think, lived through this recent history; so, i will not dwell on the temporarily successful—yet ultimately unsuccessful—efforts by the serbs to displace the ethnic albanians living in kosovo. just to refresh your memories, there were massive numbers of displaced persons involved, with refugee camps in all the neighboring countries, mostly in albania. i had done some work on guatemala with patrick ball (ball, scheuren, seltzer, and spirer 1999), which i am not going to talk about much (only to say that guatemala was the first time that i cried when doing statistics on a computer). anyway, we used multiple systems estimation techniques to do that work. jana asher and patrick ball, with a small role by me, were able to use these techniques, again, and perfect their application in kosovo. patrick, then at aaas, was going to kosovo (or really the countries around it), and i asked to get involved. this time i would play a direct role in the data collection. in human rights situations, most of the time, someone who is not a statistician— usually an inexperienced but committed advocate—does the direct data collection. we all know that when nonstatisticians, unsupervised by statisticians, collect data, they can hamper more than help; in fact, their well intended efforts sometimes make it almost impossible for us to do our work. so this direct role pleased me. let me tell a small vignette about the kosovo data collection. patrick and i had gone up to the border in the mountains of albania—to the road over the main pass from kosovo. we encountered albanian border guards there. the scene was chaotic, with people streaming across the border. the border guards were unperturbed, however. one of them had loose sheets of paper in his hands on which he was writing down the family names and counting the members of each group as they went by. when he saw us looking at him, he raised the registrations he had just done over his head, as if he were saying, “we are in control.” it was a beautiful bureaucratic moment in the best sense. and, statistically, he was right. patrick and i realized that, if we had those records, we could hold the perpetrators accountable. how to get them, then, became the issue. i went back to the united states and obtained some scanners; then patrick returned with them to albania. at great personal risk to his safety, he went back up to the border and secured the records, which were then scanned. those data became the main dataset used at the hague war crime trials, which continue. strong models inevitably arise in cases where the data are weak. here we had better collected data and, therefore, the analysis was on firmer ground. it was literally strong enough to stand up in court. in a highly charged setting with many vocal advocates, the statistician’s focus on data can encourage listening and thinking, then considered appropriate action. 2.4 afghanistan, 2002: afghan refugees after the russian and u.s. invasions the world’s human rights problems came to the u.s. in an unforgettable way on september 11, 2001—a day most young people here today clearly remember, much as my generation remembers the day president kennedy was assassinated in dallas. on both days, the world changed in ways perhaps not understood even yet. what did s do after bravely trying to save the victims? we reacted by, among other things, invading afghanistan on october 8, 2001—less than 1 month later. one side effect of that action was an increase in the number of afghans fleeing to safety in pakistan. refugee camps had been housing afghans since the russian invasion of afghanistan in the 1970s. by our involvement, we ourselves were adding to those afghan refugee camps in pakistan. to be fair, there were also concerns expressed by s about the settings in those camps, even before september 11, 2001. anyway, for many reasons, an afghan refugee survey was mounted in pakistan. how did i get involved? my work with patrick ball in the refugee camps in albania came to the attention of a good friend of mine, david nolle (at the u.s. information agency, now an integral part of the state department). david asked me to design a refugee survey of the afghans in refugee camps in pakistan, and i readily volunteered. of course, right after september 11 nobody would have said “no” to anything of that sort. i got an opportunity to work not only with david but also with ruth citrin, who was in charge of this project. i had offered to go to afghanistan myself, by the way, but was turned down, since i was only volunteering. instead, ruth went; james bell and david nolle did the analysis (with some input from me), using the sampling and data collection design we had come up with together. you have to know something about refugee camps in afghanistan to understand what came next. in the camps, there were up to three waves of refugees—refugees from the russians, refugees from the taliban, and refugees from the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) attacks that the u.s. participated in. we had to do the survey quickly, as the situation was very fluid. we also had to do it in secrecy, because we had to protect the identity of the interviewers—it was a very complex, very political, and very dangerous situation. even so, i think the work was done relatively well. when you are doing survey quality management in a situation like that, there are lots of challenges. among the problems we faced were doing the data collection in two languages, both different from our own, and dealing with contractors monitored from great distances. ruth actually went all the way to afghanistan to speak to the contractor. mahalanobis’ insights on interpenetrating designs offered a natural strategy, and we applied them with some success. incidentally, a paper on this work was actually presented at the august 2002 joint statistical meetings (jsm), less than 6 months after the fieldwork was completed. the original jsm abstract and title, while accurate, were very obscure— purposefully so. (of course, in this audience, i do not have to tell you that most of us are naturals at writing titles and abstracts like that.) this time, though, we did it for safety reasons. in fact, we were not certain, until about an hour before the paper was to be presented, whether the talk could go on as scheduled. we had to be convinced we could protect the identity of the contractor and those who did the interviewing. that paper is available in the 2002 jsm proceedings; an improved version is slated to appear as a chapter in the upcoming refereed book, tentatively titled human rights and statistical objectivity. 2.5 united states, 2004: integrity of elections my final example focuses on an integral part of being a u.s. citizen—our election process. as a native bostonian, i naturally love elections. (maybe you can even tell from my accent that i am from boston, although i have been gone a long time. it is a nice coincidence, by the way, for me that i happen to be from boston, where asa started.) when i was growing up, i was told to “vote early and often.” now, i have voted as soon as i could and as often as i could ever since. fortunately or unfortunately, i have not ever voted more than once in any one election. (maybe i left boston too soon? is there a gap in my systems thinking about elections?) my wife, who is an immigrant from china and takes her citizenship very seriously, thinks there is a gap in my thinking. she has been volunteering as a nonpartisan poll worker for many years. until you have worked in the polls, she says, you really do not understand how difficult it is to produce a fair, (close to) error free count. i would argue that, for most of us here tonight, this is true. if we are going to have better elections, statistical thinking is needed in much larger doses than at present. so i ask you, who is there to do that job, if not us—“real” statisticians? how can we do it if we do not really understand elections? why do i say that? after all, we did live through the 2004 presidential election in the u.s. (i hope all of you who were eligible voted!) was the election a success? maybe, barely. what is a successful election? here, as with the other four examples, success is related to quiet objectivity, sound statistical attention to data, and a listening attitude. from a nonpartisan perspective, my definition of a “success” is when the losing side accepts a fair outcome and, instead of protesting, works toward winning next time. on that basis, lately, we have not done too well. let me posit another definition, this more from a statistical perspective than a transactional one: a successful election is one whose margin of error is smaller than the margin of victory. now, that is a tall order, especially given how close the votes of the two main parties have been recently. it certainly was not true for florida in 2000. things were better for ohio in 2004, but only slightly so. what is my answer for 2006 and, especially, 2008? i really do not have one, except to make a process comment. i encourage you to get involved. that is what i began doing in the summer of 2004, as set out in www.votingsystems.us. volunteer in some capacity. take a day off and work inside the polls. observe the process outside the polls. look at all the things that can go wrong. (i marvel on alternate days that we have done as well as we have as a country. on the days in between, i just worry.) then, make suggestions based on solid statistical thought and application to address those issues. regardless of our party affiliations, we all stand to benefit. 3. volunteering more generally my discussion of our pro bono role has focused on statistical volunteering for human rights. there are, of course, many other settings in which asa members volunteer. i’d like to point out just a few examples of statistical pro bono work that have come to my attention during my tenure as asa president. in the four presidential columns that appeared in amstat news after this talk last august (2005), i wrote mainly about the volunteering we do in chapters, sections, and committees [21]. let me mention three more. during my asa presidency, i went to lincoln, nebraska, and spoke to the hundreds of statisticians who had volunteered to grade advance placement statistics exams for high school students. they got a small honorarium and some expenses, volunteering for about a week and a half, maybe 2 weeks. every year, the number of volunteers and exams grows. by 2005, the total number of volunteers was in the hundreds and the total number of exams reviewed had risen cumulatively to about 300,000. that is a major achievement for our profession! what is more, this important example of volunteerism has been going on for a decade. in the fall of 2005, mary ellen bock, who will be asa president in 2007, invited me to purdue, where she is chair of the department of statistics. she had already told me about statcom, the volunteer program her graduate students had started in the west lafayette community around the university. what a success it has been now over many years! the effort is such a good idea that asa strategic initiative award money has now been used to seed such groups elsewhere. for more on these initiatives, see the cover article in the february issue of amstat news, the follow up article in june 2005. at the end of my talk i mentioned that jonathan kurlander and david banks were holding an open session on volunteering the following morning and invited interested individuals to attend. about 50 jsm attendees showed up and, subsequently, a special interest group (a pre cursor possibly to establishing a new section) was formed. much good has already come of this, as we learn not only how to volunteer as individuals, but how to act together as a community. see the url org/mlast/volunteersig/index.html for further information about this initiative. the bottom line is that i urge you to get involved. if you are already involved—for some, a secret too well kept—get more involved. you can contribute your energies, skills, and expertise here, in north america, or overseas. you can lend your knowledge, efforts, and enthusiasm in person, in a refugee camp, in your local community, with those families displaced by hurricane katrina, or even from behind the familiarity of your own computer screen. my key message is that our profession needs to take on a pro bono obligation as a community. we need to do this, not just as individuals but as a professional obligation. there is theory to be done, if that is where you are in our profession. there is also certainly a need for sound statistical practice, as the examples given in this paper illustrate. also of critical value, there is a need to consolidate these experiences. in other words, there is a lot to do—so much that it can be discouraging. but do not be discouraged. “we can do it together!” 4. time to sum up in the human rights setting, there is often the challenge of improvisation. you have to work with what you find. maybe it will turn out to be inspired; or maybe it is just a “scotch taped together heuristic” that barely gets the job done, if that. we have to remember not only the triumphs, which warm our hearts (i have focused on these here), but also, alas, we must learn from our failures and move quickly to avoid repeating them. this may be hard to do after the rush of adrenalin is gone! in my experience there have always been great people doing statistics, and there are also lots of hard unsolved problems, whether you get paid to work on them or not. remember, though, that, for many settings, no money can or should be taken. the obligation is that sacred. sometimes the data are so compelling that they almost speak. but often, only statisticians have the “eyes to see and the ears to hear.” who, if not we, can make them heard? there have been many times in the past, when we probably should have spoken as a profession about the world’s issues. when we did not do so, that was too bad. but we still can, and, as a profession, we should! statistical solutions are needed now more than ever. thank you very much and god bless you.",282,15.4219858156028,4.55139112439641,0.28903196137043,4349,1257,13.1503505085542,8.15035050855418,73,0.97688496615104,"https://doi.org/10.1198/016214507000000013"

means to put our work into a decision context for policy makers; otherwise, our efforts will only inform the writers of textbooks and not the leaders who shape the world within which we live. statisticians must step up to that challenge! scientific and technical progress requires interdisciplinary teams, because it is impossible for a single individual to have enough knowledge to solve many of today’s problems, for example, mapping the genome, modeling the spread of a pandemic, and developing diagnostic and treatment devices for developing countries. a principal role of the statistician is to bring the cutting edge of statistical sciences to these problems. by the nature of our training, statisticians are well poised to assume the role of science and technology integrator. to be successful, this must place statisticians closer to policy pressures and politics. this address will focus on the growing expectations facing statistical sciences and how we, as statisticians, must take responsibility for separating the scientific method from the politics of the scientific process to guarantee that scientific excellence and impact is communicated to decision makers. thank you very much for coming tonight. i think this is a really exciting time for our profession. it is my job tonight to see if i can convince you of this. in preparation for this talk, i made the mistake of reading the last nearly 100 years of presidential addresses to the statistical association. this is a mistake because once you take that wonderful walk through history through the eyes of our leadership, you realize you have nearly nothing new to say. nevertheless, i am going to attempt to inspire you to at least think about some new things. this is an incredible time to be a scientist or engineer. i use these words in the absolutely broadest sense, including areas such as mathematics, computer science, statistics, chemistry, biology, civil engineering, social sciences, art, and even humanities. we are all scientists and engineers. all of those areas can contribute to scientific discovery and technology innovation in ways that propel our society forward. i really think that is what it is all about. the global challenges we face today are immense—everything from national and international security, global climate change, the success or collapse of international economics, space exploration, and biomedicine to air quality. i chose the theme of this meeting, “statistics in an uncertain world: meeting global challenges,” to get us to think beyond some of the boundaries our profession is comfortable with and try to understand how we can contribute to the resolution of society’s challenges. to contribute, we have to figure out how we are going to leverage our deepest theory, the most complex computation, our roots in experimentation and experimental design, multiple disciplines, information of all sorts, and all of the technology innovations we have access to. how do we blend all of this together to try to meet these challenges? it is a pretty daunting task. perhaps the real question is, “how do we fit in?” how do statisticians and statistical sciences fit into all this? i decided i was not going to debate or discuss whether we have a discipline tonight. i am standing up here to tell you that we do, and i am going to tell you what it is. i know you all know this, but i am just going to remind you, because understanding our discipline helps to answer the question of how we fit in. statistics is the discipline designed to unravel the mystery of decision making under uncertainty. “uncertainty r us.” statistics requires data and information to come together to support decision making. ours is the field that tries to understand, quantify, and explain what this means. our discipline is unique in the sense that there are no fundamental physical laws underlying it. we are not about rocks; we are not about particles; we are not about “e = mc2.” we are about trying to bring to bear for society the mysteries of information and what it tells us. statistics exists because the world is not deterministic. as a discipline, we are inherently interdisciplinary. there is simply nothing to debate regarding the existence and importance of our discipline! the real questions today are “do we have a profession?, do we need a profession?, do we have a future?, do we actually have jobs, or do we have careers?” and if we believe we have a profession and have careers, how do we best use them for the benefit of society? in hunter’s (1994) 1993 address, he gave a wonderful definition of what a profession is. he said: • “a profession advances its art through research.” we do that. • “it communicates its art through journals and meetings.” these are critically important to the profession—things we worry about vehemently: how do we continue to support and sustain the field? • “it educates.” we do that. • “it defines its art to society.” we do that every day. • “it advocates its art to society.” i would argue we need to do more of that. • “it serves society.” if we do not do this, we should all go home and find new jobs. • and, finally, “it serves its members.” i believe we clearly have a profession. in fact, the early objectives of our society, the statistical association (asa), as stated in the 1839 asa constitution, were to collect, preserve, and diffuse statistical information in the different departments of human knowledge. in 1909, north (1911) had a wonderful phrase in his talk. he said, “. statistics is the guiding thread to lead us into and out of the labyrinth mazes of social progress.” that is powerful, and it is interesting to think about how we have walked that historical path and what the future holds for us. i am going to take you down the path of what i have learned through my reading of the past presidential addresses. for me, it has been a fascinating journey. as we begin, i want to make a disclaimer: i am not a historian. i will also remind you that few, if any, of our previous presidents were historians. this will be a historical view through the eyes of the leadership of our profession. first of all, we are taught from the earliest days of our education in statistics that we are the stewards of data analysis and data methodology development. by “data” i mean all sorts of information, not just the little numbers and tables we use in our early classes. we like to tell our students—and those students in the audience will confirm this—we are guardians of the scientific method: • observation • hypothesis development • prediction • experimentation • analysis • decision. you have heard this in many of the talks already at this conference. sometimes we tend to forget our contributions to all the parts of the method, particularly the decision piece. but nonetheless, we view our field as the one that helps pull it all together. what did statisticians do 100 years ago, or at least from 1908 on? interestingly enough, statisticians played critical roles in the enumeration, recording, and reporting about society and the population. the statisticians—and the statistical association, in particular—drove policy concerning the world’s population. our field played a major role in the development of economics and social sciences. in fact, our 1914 president, koren (1915), looked out at his audience and complained it was filled with economists and social scientists. he wanted to know where the statisticians were. where were the people who were going to be able to aggressively develop the methods the rest of the people in the room needed? in this period, statisticians were employed primarily in government and some in academia. in fact, there was frustration stemming from the belief that universities were not doing an adequate job of educating statisticians. there were some really significant changepoints that had an impact on our profession in these early years. these were the two world wars. i had not fully appreciated the importance of these events on our profession until i took this historical walk. world war i brought a tremendous number of statisticians into all areas of government. a huge change occurred, because the need was no longer just enumeration and reporting what had happened; the interest was in developing ways to forecast the new situations and address resource needs. there was a call for formalization of inference and of our training in the universities. in world war ii, again, there were a large number of statisticians who helped with the war effort. after both wars, there was no problem with the job market. we are a field where demand has always exceeded supply. in fact, one of my colleagues at rice suggested i get a sandwich board and wear it at freshman orientation to increase our number of majors. interestingly enough, even before world wars i and ii, h. g. wells (1903) commented, “statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.” we are seeing this necessity being realized today, after more than two decades of the quantitative literacy initiative. following the wars, many statisticians emerged from positions in government. this workforce understood policy and they understood the government. there was a cry for statisticians, as citizens, to engage in policy in all aspects of their work. this cry was largely ignored. in the fifties and early sixties, there was great concern that we were becoming too specialized. in fact, cochran (1954) had a wonderful comment in his presentation. he said, “the increasing specialization within statistics has set up forces which tend to decrease the amount of common interest among members and to split them into separate groups. the task of serving all areas of application in this rapidly changing environment will require us to be wide awake, adaptable, and receptive to new ideas and new ventures.” as i tour our academic departments and our nonacademic statistical groups around the country today, i suggest we begin to heed his advice and open our eyes. let me speed up a bit and ask the question, “how did we train statisticians 45 years ago?” in the mid sixties, statistics departments across the country were emerging from mathematics departments and becoming separate units. statistics, as a discipline distinct from mathematics, was coming into being in our universities. this same phenomenon was occurring within industrial research laboratories. for example, the los alamos national laboratory statistical sciences group was formed in 1965. mathematics was then, and always will be, at the core of what statisticians do. it is amusing to consider the amount of headbutting between the mathematical statisticians and the applied statisticians documented in our history. yet when you talk to people, you are not always sure who’s who. in the early years, even before the creation of many of our departments, there was a concern that mathematics was becoming an art within statistics; the cart was in front of the horse and the horse was running away (ayres 1927). to be honest, when i saw that comment, i was not sure who was the cart and who was the horse. in the sixties, computation was very limited. we were doing a lot of manual calculation and our ability to address major problems was limited by the available technology. our research and our journals reflected our training. there was a tremendous amount of material going into the annals of statistics and going into the very theoretical work of jasa. we were working, in academia and in government again. statisticians were starting to find their way into industrial settings. consulting, however, was still a bit of a mystery. agriculture was a new application driver. many of our departments grew out of the needs of schools of agriculture. genetics, epidemiology, and federal statistics continued to have a strong influence on the profession. once again there were some major developments that helped change the face of our field. computers emerged, and eventually high speed pcs. we were finally able to look seriously at “real” data sets. we were able to begin to move into the realm of computational experiments, not just physical experiments. ron snee’s deming address earlier today discussed the quality movement, which had a major impact on our profession, not the least of which was to reinforce the concepts of the scientific method. the internet emerged, leading to the start of globalization. it is interesting to consider the impact tom friedman’s book, the world is flat (2006), has had. apparently we were not listening carefully to hogg (1989) in 1988. perhaps we did not understand the visionary he is. he told us, “. really, we have one marketplace.” he said we needed to pay attention to this because it calls for a different type of statistics and suggested it might be something automated. are we listening yet? we did make some very significant progress during that time. we saw model building come on the horizon, computational statistics, graphical statistics, and data mining. there was a bayesian revolution that helped us begin to envision data combination and the promise of information integration methods. we saw a proliferation of publications with a lot of diversity. we also saw statistical applications being developed in all phases of industry and society. okay, that is the good news. what is the bad news? the bad news is what we didn’t do. as a profession we did not aspire to leadership roles. some individuals did, but as a profession, we did not. janet norwood (1990) in her presentation in 1989 very specifically said, “we must place at all heads of each of the country’s major statistical agencies a person with professional qualification and unquestioned integrity.” she talked about how statistics has clearly come to play a role in critical policy decisions, but questioned whether statisticians played a role. the problem then was the same as now: we were fat and happy. we had great jobs. we had strong engagement across science and engineering, and today, even social sciences. but i wonder, are we actually stepping up and recognizing what society needs today? the twenty first century has brought us new challenges and has brought us new crises. it has actually brought us a lot of sadness. what comes to mind when you think of 2001? my guess is you remember september 11th. i attended a talk recently by a respected colleague, hector ruiz, the ceo of advanced micro devices. he said we should remember 2001 as the year we finally sequenced the human genome. i am going to encourage you to take that thought home with you tonight. there are hard and important problems out there. to contribute, we need to step up and understand what our role is as a profession. i am going to share with you the hardest lesson i have had to learn, and i argue it is a new changepoint. the lesson is, at the end of the day, it is not about modeling or data analysis, it is about decision making. i started out defining our field as the discipline responsible for unraveling the mysteries of decision making in the presence of uncertainty. if you really try to absorb that message and internalize it, you have to recognize that it means there is diversity of information and a diversity of players that come together in this context. our failure to understand this nuance means we won’t be able to contribute to the significant decisions, strategic decisions, and science decisions that confront society. our profession will miss the opportunity to make significant contributions. i really do believe science is about pushing society forward. the other thing i strongly believe is that science and policy continually collide. one of my favorite examples of this is a 1939 letter einstein wrote to president roosevelt. in this letter he told the president about a new energy source: uranium. that piece of information—science—affected policy and changed the world forever. based on that example and many more i could provide, we must realize we have to expand our thinking beyond the scientific method into what i call the scientific process. otherwise, we are not going to be able to effectively contribute to the solution of problems we are well poised to help solve, supporting decision making in the presence of uncertainty. we have to be cautious because decisions will be political and will be politicized, and they are in the hands of the policy makers as strategic decision makers. that is not necessarily us. our job as scientists, as statisticians, as engineers, is to be sure we are presenting the information these policy makers and strategic thinkers need, the information that can impact and can help them in their deliberations. likert (1960) in 1959 told us, “we are coming to recognize with increasing clarity that the capacity of a nation to function will depend upon the quality of its decision making processes and upon the adequacy and accuracy of the information used.” this is our problem. in 1990, barabba (1991), from general motors, gave a talk titled “from data to wisdom.” he made a wonderful statement i wish i had remembered, because i know it would have impacted me greatly. i have had to come to understand this on my own. i am going to share his wisdom with you and ask you to heed his remarks. barabba said, “the successful statisticians of the future must not only view their roles as bringing information to bear which reduces uncertainty relative to a particular decision at hand, but to also be sensitive to the manner in which they surface new areas of uncertainty which could materially affect the outcome of a particular decision.” he does not say we should not surface this information. he says we need to be cognizant of the effect it will have, which means we have to understand how to communicate it and how to do this in a productive way. the problems i have been engaged with over the last decade include natural disasters, terrorism or man made crises, weapons of mass destruction, and technology development in developing countries. these problems are big, difficult, and frequently scary. the progress made has had everything to do with people—people collaborating toward a common goal. i have learned that the scientific progress we can make today comes through assembling multiple talents and getting them to work together. problems today will be solved by interdisciplinary teams. why? because the depth and breadth in any single field has grown to the point that you cannot know everything in your own field, let alone know the depth needed in the partner fields to make rapid progress. therefore, we must learn to communicate with our colleagues and pull teams together to make this progress. i have recently heard leaders in different industrial sectors talking about the need for “t people.” t people? is this a new fitness craze? what are they talking about? they are talking about people who have deep knowledge in their fields, yet great curiosity across many other fields, hence the top of the t, and terrific communication skills to bring it together. some of these same leaders say this is the time of the renaissance team, not the renaissance man or woman. most importantly, they say, innovation will emerge in the gray spaces between disciplines. in statistics, our job is to know the cutting edge of statistical sciences and to bring this knowledge to our scientific colleagues in such a way that we can help move forward the problem– solution spaces. i agree, this is daunting. t people, renaissance teams, innovations: what does it mean for us? statistics is the quintessential interdisciplinary science. i like to tell my junior colleagues sometimes, “don’t worry. when we collaborate, no one expects us to know anything about chemistry, biology, or physics, even though we probably know quite a bit.” we are viewed as the neutral party. we are the ones who get to ask all the questions everyone else at the table wants to know the answers to. we are the ones who have a systematic way of thinking, are able to take a systems view. that is how we are trained. we are the ones who are willing to take a risk, willing to jump in and try to figure out how to characterize the problem space and move toward solutions, sometimes swimming out from the middle. yes, we will make mistakes, but tomorrow we are confident someone will have an even better solution. all along the way we will be the ones able to quantify and describe the uncertainty. the moral of this message is this: we are the ones who can actually step up and take a leadership role in moving forward the integration of statistics and science into decisions. in addition to various disciplines required to tackle today’s problems, there are also a large number of skills needed. we need deep theory; we need computation; we need people who can visualize and synthesize the big picture. we need people who are meticulously detail oriented. we need terrific communication skills from the 50,000 foot view all the way down to the very detailed interactions with our scientific colleagues. we need people who are willing to take risks and jump into the middle of problems, and we need those who are going to yank us back at the ankles and force us to think about first principles. we need people who have great organizational skills and can manage the complexity of the problem setting. it is unlikely anyone in this room is good at all those things, and it is even more unlikely anyone in this room likes to do all those things. but by recognizing what skills need to come to the table, you will know how to assemble your team to be sure those skills and areas are covered. hopefully, you will also recognize that everyone’s contributions are important to the success of the team and aggressively share the credit. i have talked a lot about complex problems, global challenges, and the need to bring interdisciplinary teams together. when it comes to defense and national security, we have many pressing problems. i think we really need to pay more attention to what savage (1985) told us in 1984. he was not personally interested in the military secrets; however, he did want to know that the defense community could connect to the best of our field. he said something else that is not only true for defense and security. he said, “. [t]he first lesson the statistician has to offer to the strategist is the concept of uncertainty and the measurement of variability. getting these ideas into strategic decisions will take skill and hard work, but they will add much realism.” i don’t think you can point to a single walk of life, a single area for which that is not true. we have strategic decision makers in every part of society. i want to say just a couple of words about technology. yesterday, the presidential speaker, william pulleyblank, talked to us about high performance computing, supercomputing, giant computers, all this wonderful technology. for me, the question is, “what role do we have in all of this as statisticians and as a profession?” this might appear hard to answer at first. technology, by design, comes in search of questions. technology frequently leads to expectations for the uninformed. imagine the supercomputers pulleyblank was talking about: 60,000 processors, massively parallel, operating at incredible speeds of 300 teraflops. to policymakers, such technology holds the promise of solving significant problems. for example, maybe those computers would allow us to assess the reliability of the nuclear stockpile by actually cutting back on tests because we can develop incredibly sophisticated physics codes, run them, and perhaps get answers out we actually believe. those of us who guard the scientific method may have a few things to say about this. forecasting, prediction, and uncertainty quantification have got to be conditioned on experimentation and data. our job is to be able to be articulate, and push back and try to bring realistic expectations to the role of technology. however, we crave the technology because it is what helps to drive us forward. consequently, we have to be responsible and manage the expectations of technology innovation. a current area i worry about a lot is nanotechnology. many people say if we just develop the nanowire, it will be the mechanism by which we can have efficient energy and can solve some of the energy demands of the world. i believe this is actually likely. but when? in 10 years or 40? it is the data; it is the uncertainty about the information that needs to come together and be evaluated to understand what can be expected from these technologies. david moore (1998) told us all about this in his address. as i said when i started, there is nothing new in what i am telling you. it has been fun to learn (or to remember) my colleagues were thinking really deeply about these issues. david told us “. technology empowers, but thinking enables.” where does that leave us today? statistics today is all about interdisciplinary collaboration. we need to bring statistical reasoning and rigor into a decision context. ron snee talked to us today about statistical thinking, something he has been promoting for more than 20 years. let’s pay attention to it. let’s bring it to the table. to bring it to the table means we have to be at the table. the context we are working in is interdisciplinary and complex. we have a role in handling the consequences of the technology explosion that empowers us: it brings to us new data types we have never had before and challenges us with those problems. it causes us to worry about how we are going to put it together. but we do have to play a role in managing the expectations. we have to worry about how to integrate theoretical models, computational models, physical experiments, observational data, historical data, and expert judgment. how do we put these things together? we are in the information millennium. we are in the decade of data revolution. this is the heyday for our field. who will actually solve these problems? we will. we can lead this revolution and help propel science and technology forward. do we have a future? does our profession have a future? i think what i have just described to you is clearly not just a job. i think our future is to really think about what leadership is and try to become leaders in the science integration process. we have to understand how policy and science can collide if we are going to be productive. most importantly, we have to recognize communication is key: not only is it part of the process, it is a process in its own right. we must step out and take leadership roles, and encourage our colleagues to do the same. we don’t need everyone to do this, but we need some of our community to step up. we need representation at the levels of president, vice president, and chief executive officers in our major industries. we need people, as janet norwood (1990) said, in the leadership of not just the statistical agencies, but our federal agencies too. we need people in leadership roles in our academic institutions: presidents, provosts, and deans. we need to realize this is important for our profession and it is important for society to have statistical thinking and rigor at those tables. i say if we want to achieve scientific excellence, it is our time, it is our decade, it is our century to step up and do it. we need to become the stewards of the science integration process. we have already mastered being stewards of the data analysis and data methodology development processes. we have completely succeeded in guarding the scientific method. let’s step out and see if we can be the guardians of the scientific process. we are not going to succeed alone. we are only going to succeed if we recognize our profession plays a critical role. the statistical association, which is our society, is the largest and most powerful statistical society in the world. this means the leadership of this society and the leaders among our membership are exactly who will propel our profession forward. this is your society. help shape it. thank you for your attention and support. good night.

2007,"102nd","Bock, Mary Ellen","Female","Purdue University","Academia","167th","July 29 – August 2, 2007","Salt Lake City, UT","Statistics: Harnessing the Power of Information","Statistics: Harnessing the Power of information",2007-08-07,"Mary Ellen Bock","2000-2020","﻿statisticians are harnessing the power of information buried in today’s massive and complex data. high dimensional data sets, often the result of combining multiple databases, have led to important challenges in mathematical statistics. the increasing quantity of highdimensional complex data and the ability of statisticians to uncover the information in it have led to ever greater demand for their expertise. for example, many businesses seek to build analytic capabilities, and statisticians are essential to this effort. to meet the increased demand, the academic community has been called on to provide more statistics courses, faculty, and graduates. although statisticians who can meet these demands of modern data are highly sought after, the employment prospects for statisticians are not easy to track, because the term “statistician” often is not used for relevant positions. however, the trend is unmistakable for statisticians who can unlock the power of these new data sets. statistics graduate students are uncovering the value of information in data for local government and community nonprofit organizations through statistics in the community (statcom), an statistical association student volunteer organization for pro bono statistics. statcom provides statistics students with real world experiences while providing invaluable community assistance. today’s data come in a flood and contain a great deal of important information. the next section points out the increasing presence of high dimensional and complex data in this flood and its importance to statistics research. section 3 notes the demand for statistical expertise that new kinds of data generate. section 4 describes the growth of pro bono statistics groups among statistics graduate students. the concluding section is a summary. 2. high–dimensional complex data modern data sets are frequently high dimensional and complex, sometimes the result of combining large numbers of relatively simple data sets. sorting out the information in an individual reasonably sized data set may be straightforward, but the process becomes much more complicated when many such data sets are combined. if the individual data sets are not highdimensional, then these combined data sets are almost invariably complex and extremely multivariate. the role and importance of computational statistics has grown significantly through these kinds of problems. expertise in databases is an important component. statistical model building and selection for high dimensional complex data are key to extracting information from these modern data sets. as predicted (donoho 2000), the ubiquitous presence of high dimensional data has already inspired extraordinary work in mathematical statistics. some of the most exciting problems occur with the “big p, little n” problem, where p, the number of dimensions in an observation vector, is larger than n, the number of observation vectors. microarray data have spurred many theoretical developments for this problem. a person (a single observation, n = 1) has more than 10,000 genes (p = 10,000), but very few studies are so fortunate to have this many subjects. such data come from almost every field; for example, more characteristics than the numbers of patients or customers is now a standard feature of medical and business data. in the case of a medical patient study, one of the databases might be a genealogy or genetic information database that is available in salt lake city; examples include the lds family history library, the utah population database, and the database. another database for the study might be microarray expression data from a set of patients. an important feature adding to the complexity is that not all of the databases were generated for the purposes of the study. obviously, once the information is combined, there may be far more different types of characteristics measured for each patient than there are patients. modern statistical methods for high dimensional data seek to enable us to select which, if any, of the patient characteristics are effective predictors of patient responses to various treatments. an even more common scenario is a business with large amounts of information about its customers obtained from the web and various databases. these data sets are important for managers who want to “compete on analytics,” that is, use data to optimize business decisions (davenport and harris 2007). once again, the databases were not necessarily collected to generate high level business insights, but rather to keep track of customer orders or other purposes. the expertise of the database manager is the first requirement for combining the databases. but taking advantage of the information in these combined databases requires statistical expertise, specifically expertise in working with high dimensional data sets. across a wide range of applications, the ability to bring more information together to solve problems has led to ever greater data dimensionality, which continues to challenge standard methodologies. 3. demand for statistical expertise the proven ability of statisticians to make sense of the growing flood of data is increasing the demand for statistical expertise, especially for statisticians with high levels of computational expertise. 3.1 analyzing new types of data and more data analyzing new types of data is an important area of demand for statistical expertise; examples include bioinformatics data (e.g., microarrays, protein data), web data, new types of marketing data, and hedge fund data. one of the biggest potential increases comes from business data and analytics, that is, “business by the numbers.” it is becoming a basic part of the modern business tool kit to use the information in the data about the business to optimize outcomes. an amazing amount of data remains unexamined and unused in businesses, especially web data. but the business entities who make use of statistical expertise to understand the information in the data gain an important competitive advantage. the cost of statistical expertise is miniscule compared with the cost of accumulating and storing the information about the business and its customers. human resources managers are trying to hire people with analytics expertise, that is, people who have the statistical expertise to use data to make business decisions. the term “analytics” does not necessarily convey its essential connections with the field of statistics, however. government and industry increasingly deal with more types of data, which broadens the range of opportunities for statisticians within the same employment organization. in a pharmaceutical organization, for example, statisticians can work in clinical trials, marketing, discovery, quality control, and analytics, to name a few areas. furthermore, for the computationally savvy, the work in analytics opens another pathway to upper management through the chief information officer route. 3.2 filling the demand academic programs in statistics also are sensitive to hiring trends in the field. academic institutions provide most of the education for the statistical expertise worldwide and count numerous faculty members with graduate level degrees (or equivalent expertise) in the statistical sciences. courses in statistics are in increased demand as faculty members in multiple disciplines realize the importance of statistical expertise to their students’ success. an increasing number of academic institutions are considering statistical literacy basic to any educational experience, which further increases demand for courses. demand for statistics faculty is a natural result of the increased demand for courses. faculty members in other disciplines also want to collaborate with statistics faculty members to augment their own research. academic institutions find themselves competing with the government and private sectors for statistics instructors and researchers. graduates from statistics programs find themselves with choices for employment in various sectors. many programs are increasing in size, whereas other universities have several types of statistics programs, including biostatistics, econometrics, and so on. there is a demand for new statistics programs with computationally rich curricula. an important source of information for programs is the statistical association caucus of academic representatives. their website is chairs, heads, and leaders of statistics programs formed the caucus and held their first workshop for chairs at the 2007 joint statistical meetings in salt lake city, utah. 3.3 cooperating to meet the demand the growing demand for statistical expertise in government and industry is fueling increased cooperation with academic institutions, such as through the national institute of statistical sciences. undergraduate and graduate level internships in government and industry provide important practical experience for students and allow these organizations to vet potential job candidates as well as tap their expertise, especially in the case of graduate students. for some industrial organizations, graduate student internships allow the organization to discover the effectiveness of statistical expertise before they commit to developing a statistical position. joint research projects between academic institutions and government or industry provide invaluable specialized expertise to government or industry and important new problems and research directions for faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and even undergraduate students. 3.4 employment prospects: what’s in a name? people making career choices need to know that a statistics education opens many doors for them. in the past, large numbers of talented students have chosen education in mathematics, computer science, or business to provide the most options. in our data rich world, statistics is an alluring option for the mathematically, computationally, or commercially inclined student. it is a diverse field welcoming members from around the world, with a record of 47% female u.s. doctoral recipients in 2005–2006. phds in statistics recognize the breadth of their options. other fields of academia are especially receptive to these students who have some course work or experience in those specific fields. the combination of a graduate level degree in statistics with an mba has enormous potential in the area of analytics. statistical consulting also offers a flexible kind of employment not available in many disciplines. although we know that there are many great opportunities and jobs for those with statistical expertise, when a prospective student (and parent) looks for data on the employment prospects for “statisticians,” the rosy picture does not seem so obvious. official u.s. government sources count as “statisticians” only those whose job title is “statistician.” those working in analytics, or bioinformatics or any of the other emerging fields have different titles, such as biostatisticians and econometricians, and the official counts miss them. growth in the numbers of academic faculty members also is overlooked, because these faculty members are described as “postsecondary mathematical science teachers.” in its online occupational outlook handbook july 2007, the u.s. bureau of labor statistics predicted slower than average growth for the 2004–2014 period in jobs that carry the title “statistician.” but in the 2008–2009 edition (u.s. department of labor, bureau of labor statistics 2008, the prediction for the 2006–2016 period increased to average growth. however, the handbook noted that the employment prospects for those with degrees in statistics actually were better than that, because so many available positions do not carry the title “statistician.” 4. pro bono statistics we have discussed how statistics is being used to harness the power of information in the private sector, government, and academia. however, local government or community nonprofit organizations sometimes cannot afford statistical expertise or may not be aware of how they could profit from it. an organization offering pro bono statistical services to such organizations is statcom, a network of student run volunteer groups operating in teams at different universities. for a city council, a statcom team could create and analyze a survey of merchants in a certain shopping area to ascertain their needs for physical improvements in landscaping or parking. for a public library, a team could analyze the data for withdrawals to show library management that more cds than books are checked out. (this obviously would have significant implications for the way the library organizes its functions.) the first statcom group (gunaratna 2006) was established at a large midwestern university by statistics graduate students with experience in the statistics department consulting service. the group formed teams consisting of more senior students along with more junior students and took on basic consulting projects for local government and community nonprofit organizations. the process introduced the personnel of the local organizations to the power of statistics through analytics and provided the students with invaluable real world experience. a grant from the asa for materials and support allowed the original statcom students to expand their program to other universities. information on the asa website is provided to help other schools create such programs. the asa website for the network of statcom groups around the country is although statcom is currently a program at the graduate level, it has the potential to incorporate undergraduate or even high school students on its teams. it can change the way students think about statistics and the kinds of experiences that they receive. it has the property of making clear to students and employers the value of their statistical expertise at even the most basic level, to say nothing of making wonderful contributions to local communities. 5. conclusion statistical expertise is essential to harnessing the power of the information buried in modern data, especially when the data are high dimensional and complex. combinations of multiple data sets are common sources of high dimensional data due to the existence of multiple databases. (in some cases, none of the original data sets that make up the combination were highdimensional.) it is an exciting time for research in the field of statistics as the scope of models and model building expands to capture the rich panorama of new applications for these kinds of data. this research is needed in every field of application, but examples of high dimensional data abound in medicine and business. this data flood is accelerating the demand for those with statistical expertise, especially those who also are computationally savvy. the growth of analytics (i.e., using business data to optimize business outcomes) is an important source of this increased demand. the effect on academia is an increase in the demand for statistics courses, for statistics instructors, for statistics researchers, for statistics graduate students, and for statistics programs that emphasize modern data. government, industry, and academia cooperate for the resources of statistical expertise through internships and joint research projects. this increased demand means that the field of statistics provides excellent opportunities for mathematically, computationally, or commercially inclined students. but federal government statistics do not necessarily capture the increased demand for statistical expertise, because so many of the positions do not carry the title “statistician.” those positions concerned with analytics are a good example. even statistics faculty members are not counted under the title “statistician” by the government. statcom is an important new source of pro bono statistical expertise for local government and community nonprofit organizations. this network of statistics graduate student volunteers will be instrumental in spreading the word about the capability of statistics to harness the power of information in today’s data.

statisticians engage in many activities, and we are often excited about the work we do. in teaching, seeing the understanding develop in a student is a wonderful thing. sometimes it occurs well after the teaching moment. finding a new methodological result is great fun and immensely satisfying. however, until we tell our profession about it, the result is private, and it is of little use to others. consulting and collaborative work involve intense communication—from the stage of problem definition to the development of study plans (edits, analyses, and so forth.) to telling the client the results and writing the study report. letting others know what we have discovered is key to our (and, indeed, any other) profession. with whom do we communicate? statisticians are asked to talk to students (of all stages), to clients (some even pay for the privilege), to the public, for legal proceedings, and to the government. one of the most important things to communicate is what a wonderful and exciting field statistics is. this should begin with students in elementary school and continue throughout all ages. we can be more inclusive: statisticians are not just those with degrees in mathematical statistics; people in quality control, people in the social sciences, people in education, people in economics all do statistics, but they usually do not become members of the asa. why are we less than perfect communicators with nonscientists? we have low expectations of ourselves in terms of explaining statistical ideas. we sometimes use too much statistical jargon and often assume we cannot explain things successfully (so we do not try). we often fail to allow for public mistrust and assume more than we should. (how many citizens understand the assumptions of an analysis and the implications of the failure of these assumptions?) we do not allow for the public’s limited knowledge. (how many of your parents know or care what a normal distribution is?) we do not trust the public or the press. (do we believe the public is swayed by emotional arguments, or that the press presents only marginal results and not the multivariate results?) we believe we are outside the communications process; we don’t have to inject ourselves in the debate, because we understand the results statistically. and sometimes we go beyond our expertise, by commenting on a medical or social issue without knowledge of the details and implications. in my (limited) experience, the press often makes preliminary results look like a final outcome. this is true in drug development when a company announces that their new product is entering clinical trials. the company is usually careful to note that the regulatory agency must evaluate the product, but the media (or the press release) makes it sound as if the product is very close to licensure, although availability to the public may be several years away. they tout the potential benefits of the product and may not indicate the road that lies to licensure. similarly, some scientists may contribute to this when a single (perhaps small, nonrandomized) study shows an effect. even when they state that the results are preliminary, the press may decide the product is good or bad quite prematurely. communicating about political polls is also an issue we have many examples of electoral polls that predicted incorrectly. the reasons for this relate to poor sampling frames, leading to biased outcomes, poor timing, or poor wording of questions. sometimes candidates or issue oriented groups that have a stake in the outcome conduct the polls. tacit acceptance by voters of the results of these polls can affect the outcome of an election, and tacit acceptance by candidates of their own poll results can result in self deception. sometimes the candidate’s poll is more of a political message than an attempt to get information. sometimes the political landscape is changing, so the results of a poll taken one day do not closely predict what will happen to the polls that will take place a month later. what do we communicate? we need to communicate the message that the data are conveying. the messages are likely to be both positive and negative. for example, if the data contain many missing values or the data violate the assumptions of the procedures, the investigators need to explain the effects on the conclusions. one concern arises when the investigators conduct multiple analyses and do not adjust for this. this is an issue with a public that is not statistically perceptive. what media do we use? most often, we use professional journals. in such cases, we can couch the conclusions cautiously. however, for subject matter journals, the press may pick up the article, or our coauthors may distribute a press release, and we need to explain the conclusions. it is wise to prepare for this. rarely, radio or television reporters may ask for an interview. this has happened with the women’s health initiative, with studies of breast cancer screening, and with the vioxx studies. how do we use these media? for professional journals, we must observe the scholarly requirements we impose on ourselves: correct, precise analyses that can withstand scrutiny. ethical issues must always be observed. for general media (i.e., those primarily read by nonstatisticians), we need to understand that (1) the media (press, broadcast) are always on a short time frame and usually do not know much statistics; (2) they are interested in a short and correct statement, preferably something that can fit in a 10to 15 second sound bite, or a paragraph in a news report (hayes and grossman (2006) discuss these issues); and (3) whatever we communicate with the media must be accurate and correct. the best we can hope for is to communicate the conclusions of the study. it is good to offer to check the report for accuracy, but we must remember that if this offer is accepted, we have an obligation to respond rapidly. how do we communicate? we need to use proper grammar and speaking skills. another aspect is unwritten and unspoken communication. if we dress inappropriately, the audience may not hear our message: i pay less attention to a speaker if he wears blue jeans and at shirt. i assume he does not care about getting his message across. if a person in a meeting is reading material not related to the subject of the meeting, i notice it and discount any comments the reader makes. body language can communicate interest or disinterest. things like folded arms, lack of eye contact, a tilted head, or looking away may suggest disbelief or disinterest in one’s message. many techniques to express interest are available and you can find these online. none of them is foolproof. 3. professional development issues as statisticians, we expect to continue to learn new statistical methods and techniques throughout our career. at the jsm, we offer many short courses on topics of new statistical interest. for example, in 2008 there were 43 courses on topics including clinical trial issues, genomics, statistical modeling, data mining, graphical methods, and many others. these courses are outstanding values. those of us who are located near universities can attend seminars to learn new techniques. some of us even develop these techniques (otherwise, we would be out the door!). but statisticians who are not located near universities or who do not work for employers that subsidize continuing education may not see the value of attending technical training courses. we do not all work in universities and colleges. table 1 is from an asa report. as you can see, most of the statisticians in the asa are not in academe. some of the nonacademics are primarily statistical researchers, but most are not. for example, although many statisticians at the fda publish, the majority do not. similarly, in business and industry, most do not publish. some people attend technical development courses at jsm or log on to ‘‘webinars’’ (web based seminars that the biopharmaceutical section has been actively developing). we encourage other sections to develop similar programs. as mentioned, the asa also offers learnstat programs in many areas. for example, this year there was a course on the analysis of censored data. other courses offered since 2006 have included the r language, applied longitudinal analysis, selection bias and covariate imbalance in clinical trials, microarrays, detecting computer intruders, hierarchical modeling and analyses for spatial data, bayesian clinical trials, and the guidelines for assessment of instruction in statistical education (gaise). statisticians are highly qualified to speak to other professions regarding their data collection and their study designs, but we often do not communicate this clearly. i was recently surprised when i learned that some people did not regard research design as part of statistics. there is a failure to communicate our message here. somebody failed us and our colleagues in the application area by teaching that statistics did not have anything to contribute here. many of our members need a different form of professional development. they may not want or require high level technical courses, but they need basic skills in management and professional demeanor. in one sense, these skills are not unique to statistics, but are something all professionals have need of in their careers. we must act as professionals. in some job settings, a coat and tie are the standard dress; if you are interviewing, you should dress professionally. when companies visit a governmental agency, all the visitors wear coats and ties or business attire. another need for professionals is to be well organized. this means that paper files and computer files (including e mail) should be designed so that it is easy to find things, instead of a challenge. (this is an example of do as i say, not do as i do!) i am always searching for documents or e mail and this is because of my poor organizational skills. one needs to categorize files by subject, by need for action, and by frequency of use (e.g., often, sometimes, or archival), and one needs to do this consistently. now, if i could only do this. many companies are subcontracting work to organizations outside the united states. we call this outsourcing, but it is really subcontracting. as a profession, we need to consider some of the issues in this. what statistical activities can be outsourced? these may include basic analyses and data entry or even data exploration, study design, and sophisticated analyses. who are outsourcers? these may be company subsidiaries or divisions, or they may be contract research organizations. what issues are there? first, most foreign subcontractors now have insufficient statistical expertise and need some help. they are maturing rapidly and in 5 or 10 years will be on a par with their counterparts in other parts of the world. second, international time difference is an obstacle. currently, the meeting times are in the middle of the night (or early in the morning) for asian subcontractors. both the contracting company and the outsourcing company need appropriate scheduling. currently, the outsourcing company tends to call the shots. it may (need to) change in the future. these groups communicate through teleconferencing, e mail, video conferencing, and some face to face meetings. third, companies must develop their subcontractors. bright people need to grow and not just do the basic work; they need the opportunity to grow and to be creative. another professional development issue is that we need to participate more in the governance of our organizations. these may be a professional group such as the asa or that of our employer. in the asa, there are many opportunities to serve in sections, serve on committees, participate in local and annual meetings, and so forth. in our work organizations, we can serve in groups that use our technical expertise or in hiring, promotion, and tenure. in universities, there are service activities that need our help. in running a professional organization, there is a strong reliance on volunteer help. you can let your willingness to work be known by contacting the asa office, a chapter, or a section. management skills are an essential part of professional development. i have found a brief description of some management skills and methods in heller and hindle (1998). one simple item is the frequency with which we need to meet with our clients. some clients are knowledgeable about statistics and do not need frequent meetings, but others do. usually, during the first stages of a project, we need to have a lot of contact, if only to ensure we address the right problem (type iii error, right answer to the wrong problem). some of these skills relate to communication, as indicated previously. we learn other skills on the job. for example, in preparing a research protocol, one must learn about budgets. not many of us had training in what items go into a budget. the first time we prepare a budget, we learn a lot, but that can be painful and possibly costly. for example, failing to include overhead items is unlikely to occur in an organization, but for the private contractor this can be a disaster. using the resources that are available to you is essential. you may have access to a grants or contracts management team with responsibility for developing proposals. more generally, every business has its system of operations and individuals cannot be creative in this area. you need to work within the system. when you do not follow the rules, you get to do it again. writing skills are key to success. this holds not only for writing articles, but also for writing a resume. the format of a resume is quite different if you are applying for a job at an academic institution than if you are applying for a job at a company. in my experience, the academic resume is much drier, listing papers, degrees, jobs, courses taught, and so forth, whereas for industry there is much more of a narrative, particularly including your career goals. proper use of english (in english speaking countries) is necessary. poor grammar is a turnoff to readers. interviewing skills are also important. these are usually lacking in junior and in some more senior statisticians. of course, we need to make a good impression if we are applying for a job. we can think of questions we want to have answered when we interview. we can also think of information we would want from job candidates. a recent job candidate impressed me by having a notebook full of information about each member of our faculty, and he knew what my interests were, even though he was not a statistician. i fear that when i conduct interviews, i ask the same thing 5 or 10 others have already asked. we should discuss and plan the roles of each of the interviewers to allow a more informative interview process. each person doesn’t have to learn everything about the job candidate. and we should pay attention to nonverbal signals during the interview, both from the candidate and those that we convey. in hiring and recruiting, most jobs must be advertised in appropriate journals. there are specific legal requirements with which employers must comply. if you ‘‘shortcut’’ these, you and your firm may feel the pinch later. in some instances, small businesses are exempt from these requirements, but they are helpful in identifying outstanding job candidates. they can also lead you to interview some duds. a job candidate who cannot communicate is at a great disadvantage. many of us have difficulty managing our time. heller and hindle (1998) suggest the following: 1. every day set aside some time to review and prioritize your time demands. this may be as formal as writing down an agenda, or less formal, as in knowing what you will do at various times. for example, i read and answer (if needed) e mail early in the morning. if i am teaching a class, i schedule it to repeat automatically on my calendar. having an online calendar or pda helps greatly. you can do some of this planning on the way to work, but do not take this as permission to drive poorly. 2. if you have a large task, divide it into small chunks and do them in short time chunks. in writing this talk, it came together in sections over about 9 months (with regular panic sessions). 3. learn how to delegate tasks. i am poor at this. in academia, one does not get a lot of practice in delegating until you are at a moderately high administrative level. in other jobs, you have greater opportunities to learn delegation. one common complaint i have heard is that it may take more time to explain the job than it does to do it. however, the delegation can also be training for the next time, and both you and the person to whom you delegate will have greater confidence in being able to do the task. 4. keep a time log and check to see how accurate you are in estimating the time for tasks. this works well with item 1. a convenient breakdown is 30 minute chunks. 5. allow some thinking time each day. i find that early in the day works best for me. 6. allocate tasks into groups: routine tasks (50%–60% of your time?), ongoing projects (20%–30%?), planning (10–30%?). statistical consultants often do not have a good idea what they are worth. one algorithm suggests that we should base our fees on our annual income. we should find the hourly rate and increase it, depending on how much time we anticipate for overhead (supplies, rental, insurance, and so on), and for time when we are soliciting business. networking is important. it is good to establish contacts and friends in the profession. these people can help to critique your work, help you find new employees, and help set realistic approaches to tough problems. these are just a few of the issues that we can address in the future. in particular, we do not teach business skills in graduate statistics programs. however, for nonacademics, these can be extremely important. 4. the future of the statistical association: our strategic plan our new strategic plan has mapped some changes in our way of doing business. we will revamp our committee system. committees are an extension of the board (and of the association) that help to accomplish its goals. it is important that these be run efficiently and be rewarding for the participants. one concept from management training is: get the job done and keep the group together. committees overburdened with paperwork have difficulty getting the job done. in the future, we will see changes as the association implements the strategic plan and considers more electronic journals, changes and additions to various member services, changes to our annual meetings, and changes that embrace a broader group of our members. i will close with some words john adams wrote to his granddaughter, caroline: ‘‘you are not singular in your suspicions that you know but little. the longer i live, the more i read, the more patiently i think, and the more anxiously i inquire, the less i seem to know.’’",261,14.2222222222222,4.87338362068965,0.300377155172414,3712,1115,13.9917959770115,8.9917959770115,90,0.491105018356422,"https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2009.0033"

if not now, when?” 1.2 statistics in the journey from evidence to policy the theme for our conference is “statistics: from evidence to policy.” this theme was chosen to emphasize that “statistics have become an integral part of public policy” (norwood 1990, p. 4), as former asa president janet norwood emphasized in her presidential address. this theme implies action, from evidence to policy, requiring that we as statisticians collaborate and communicate with decision makers. we cannot take an idle or passive approach. if we do, we will be doomed to be marginalized, or worse, excluded. we need to be proactive and reach out to the policy community. to be clear, our role is to inform policy decisions. our role is not to make policy decisions. this line between policy relevance and policy making is not an easy one to walk, but we need to do so. yesterday we were fortunate to have dr. rebecca blank, the undersecretary for economic affairs at the department of commerce, as the presidential invited speaker. dr. blank’s talk was titled “measurement matters: why good statistics are important to understanding the well being of families.” she stated that the limitations of our poverty and income measures “affected the political conversation and even led to misinterpreting the policy record at times” (blank 2009). she challenged us to produce “new statistical initiatives to better measure well being” (blank 2009). dr. blank’s work is an ideal example of the use of, and need for, statistics in the journey from evidence to policy. our discipline can map this journey. we as individual statisticians can be explorers on this journey. the asa can be the guide for this journey. tonight we are 2.01 miles physically from the capitol according to mapquest. let us consider the metaphorical journey from evidence to policy. why take this journey? how does one make this journey? what impact might such a journey have? tonight, i will answer these questions by discussing three things: • why individual statisticians should be involved in policy and how we might do so. • why the asa should be involved in policy and how it might do so. • the impact statistics can have on policy. 2. the role of the individual statistician in policy let us turn to the first point—why individual statisticians should be involved in policy. three reasons are: • statistics should be connected to society. • statisticians have an important role to play in policy. • the discipline of statistics is ideally suited to policy. 2.1 statistics should be connected to society roger pielke, in his book the honest broker: making sense of science in policy and politics (pielke 2007), says that “science should be connected to society” (pielke 2007, p. 10), and that the “role of science in society is changing. scientists are being asked by policy makers to contribute more directly to the needs of society” (pielke 2007, p. 31). policy is a decision by government. politics is the negotiation and compromise to get that policy implemented (pielke 2007, p. 36). science is the pursuit of knowledge. science is not an activity to be hidden away from policy and politics. the jaded observer of the news might conclude that science is sometimes used as ammunition to promote one side or the other of an issue, rather than as a tool to clarify options. to twist the old saying—she uses statistics as a pugilist uses a flashlight, more for fighting than illumination. the triumvirate of science, policy, and politics must work hand in hand for the good of society. they must work together, not as competitors nor in isolation. 2.2 statisticians have an important role to play many of us, including myself, became statisticians because of the connection between statistics and society. with its utility across a variety of fields, statistics attracted us by its potential for impact. might you discover a new potential in your career by informing policy? you can do so by becoming an “honest broker” (pielke 2007, p. 2). as defined by pielke, an honest broker is a scientist who clarifies all policy options and their associated uncertainties. pielke states that “for the protection of science and the constructive role that it can play in policy, we desperately need organizations and individuals who are willing to expand the range of options available to policy makers by serving as honest brokers” (pielke 2007, p. 141). statisticians and the asa can meet this need to inform policy. being an honest broker in the journey from evidence to policy sometimes feels like being at the wheel of an out of control car—the best you can do is hang on. in 2004 the food and drug administration banned the sale of dietary supplements containing the herb ephedra. this decision was based on a statistical evaluation of safety. five of 84 deaths reported to the fda as caused by ephedra were classified in our study as idiopathic. by idiopathic, we mean that all other reasonable causes of death besides ephedra had been ruled out. the statistical evidence of these five deaths alone partially motivated the change in the law. it also could be argued that the fda’s objective in challenging the regulation of dietary supplements had an effect. sometimes it is unclear where the science, the policy, and the politics each end. 2.3 the discipline of statistics is ideally suited to policy the third reason why a statistician should be involved in policy is that our discipline is ideally suited to do so. as senator daniel patrick moynihan, who spoke to us at the 1998 joint statistical meetings, said: “everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” statistics is “both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data” according to the 104th president of the royal statistical society david hand (hand 2009, p. 288). statistics provides the language of probability and a paradigm to explore policy options. with the tools of statistics, a statistician can be an honest broker in policy. effectively informing policy requires becoming involved early in the design phase; understanding the problem content; knowing how to communicate, educate, and explain; and understanding how to do so in the proper time frame. as john holdren, president obama’s science advisor, said, numbers are “always something never everything” in policy decisions (cossa 2009). hermann habermann identified the differing “clock speeds” between statisticians and policy makers (habermann 2009). is the right clock speed the 4 years of an administration, or tomorrow’s press conference? how do we communicate uncertainty as an understandable “sound bite?” these are questions that we may not naturally deal with, or even feel comfortable answering. to be relevant in the world of policy, we need to do so. in the first national survey of its kind, the hiv costs and services utilization project estimated that half of the people infected with hiv in the united states in 1995 did not receive health care (bozzette et al. 1998). with the epidemic changing rapidly, an estimate perceived to be outdated would be questioned. all that really mattered was that many people (approximately 300,000–400,000) were not receiving care. many did not know they were infected, or knew that they were infected but nevertheless were not receiving care. the size and policy impact of the point estimate made the confidence interval less relevant. we had to work on policy clock speed to inform policy. 2.4 how to get involved asa past president ron iman asked each of us to change society’s view of statistics, noting that “it is incumbent on each of us to make efforts to change society’s paradigm of the statistics profession” (iman 1995, p. 1). no matter your statistical role now, you can inform policy and transform the image of statistics. if you are educating the next generation of statisticians, use policy examples in class. if you are a methodologist, develop techniques to deal with problems that arise in policy. if you are a government statistician, obviously you are informing policy every day—please collaborate to educate the other segments of our discipline. you also might volunteer. for example, the asa asked several members to advise congress on climate change legislation. the members met with congressional staff and developed materials on how statistics can contribute. another group of volunteers is working to improve vote tabulation efforts. volunteer to ensure that policy decisions are driven by evidence. reach out beyond the usual statistical audience when you disseminate your work. be bold and speak out to show the impact that statistics can have. you are an ambassador for statistics. 3. the role of the statistical association the second point i want to address is why the asa should inform policy. two reasons are as follows: • we must be involved to fulfill our mission. • we have the capability, resources and responsibility to make a contribution. we must serve not only our members, but also the nation. to borrow from the slogan of the national academies, we should strive to become “advisers to the nation on statistics” (http:// www.nas.edu). 3.1 our mission, strategy, and responsibility the asa’s mission is to use the discipline of statistics to enhance human welfare. informing policy falls squarely within our mission and 2008 strategic plan. the plan supports the asa’s participation in policy to inform decision making. the plan includes visibility and identity for statistics, including in policy. the asa is poised to have an even greater impact. we are the world’s largest professional association of statisticians. we have a dedicated and talented membership. we hired a director of science policy in 2008 who has energized our policy strategy. policy is a fundamental part of who we are. 3.2 the asa’s valuable voice the guiding principle of the asa’s policy strategy is to integrate statistics and statisticians into policy. to do this, we must determine three things: • when and how should the asa speak in policy arenas? • how do we maintain our scientific objectivity in debates that are inherently political? • how do we ensure that ours is a voice that adds value? i ask you to consider whether you should add your voice to the asa’s voice? yes. the asa’s voice is composed of the individual voices, and yours counts. two days from now, on thursday august 6, 60 asa members will march to congress. we will ask that statistical literacy be promoted in the elementary and secondary education act reauthorization, formerly known as no child left behind. we will also ask that the national science foundation and the national institutes of health receive sufficient funding increases to support their missions. many have marched to the hill. though the volume of 120 feet might not be as loud as some previous marches, our voices will be heard as together we use the discipline of statistics to enhance human welfare. 3.3 being listened to if we do not speak, we will not be heard. if we do not speak well, we will not be listened to. speaking has its challenges, however. we must draw on our integrity as a scientific society carefully, sparingly, and wisely. we must make a decision to speak transparently. other institutions, such as the national research council, have complementary and contrasting capabilities. we must play to our strengths. we have received criticism from members about our speaking out. generally the criticism centers on the content of a statement, not the fact that the asa is speaking. we need to continue to work together to resolve such issues. “an asymmetric loss function awaits our public utterances,” and “ill considered” statements might do lasting harm to our reputation, according to adrian smith, past president of the royal statistical society (smith 1996, p. 380). on the other hand, silence stifles our ability to support policy decisions based on evidence. the asa must consider the nature of our loss function. can we as an association afford to be silent? no. i believe we cannot. we cannot afford to be silent. can the asa be successful at informing policy? yes. other associations have been, and we can as well. for example, in 2008 the physical society and the association for the advancement of science produced a report on nuclear forensics. nuclear forensics is the analysis of material to determine why an explosion occurred, or to identify the source of material. hopefully, good forensics will “discourage behavior that could lead to a nuclear event” (joint working group of the aps and aaas 2008). a bill was signed into law that included four of the report’s five recommendations. together, these two associations informed policy. we can do so as well. 4. the journey from evidence to policy in healthcare this leads me to my third point: what impact can statistics have on policy? we must remember that society is made up of individuals, and at the heart of statistics are individuals. many assume that statistics is about averages and not about people. david hand has emphasized the importance of personalizing statistics—making the link between statistics and individuals (hand 2009). it is easy to forget that link sometimes, when we sit at computer screens and watch numbers flow by. but many of us have switched from statistician to parent or family member. many of us have wondered which health care treatment is best for our loved one. i know for the parents here today, many of us feared for the life of our child. i have. i sat in an emergency room wondering—would the doctor be able to determine what was wrong with my 1 year old? she was my child, my daughter. what treatment would work best for her? she was not a statistic—she was an individual. statisticians and statistics can help bridge the gap between numbers on a page, averages, and individuals. personalizing statistics demonstrates the relevance of our discipline. my example today of the impact that statistics can have on policy is a setting in which statistics bridges that gap. the example is comparative effectiveness research, a current topic in health care reform. 4.1 evidence based decision making evidence based decisions are based on objective evidence. the use of evidence based decision making ranges from education (see http:// ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/ ) to environmental issues to criminal justice to national security. this approach has been prominent in health care since the early 1990s. evidence based medicine is defined as “the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients” (sackett et al. 1996, p. 71). the institute of medicine (iom) has estimated that less than half of all health care treatments delivered today are supported by evidence (iom 2007). which health care treatment “works best, for whom, and under what circumstances?” (slutsky and clancy 2009). this is the central question of comparative effectiveness research, a subset of evidence based medicine. 4.2 comparative effectiveness research in the stimulus bill recently, considerable attention has been focused on comparative effectiveness research (cer). the 2009 recovery and reinvestment act (arra), the “stimulus bill,” provided $1.1 billion to support cer. the law included $1.5 million to fund an iom committee to recommend national priorities for comparative effectiveness research. our committee released a report in 4 months. the gooznews on health blog stated that we weren’t “afraid to elevate some of the toughest issues in medicine—the ones where entrenched special interests earn lots of money practicing lack of evidencebased medicine and oppose efforts to know what works best” (gooznews on health blog 2009). it was time to make a difference. as a statistician, i felt i had both the tools and responsibility to contribute. all of you as statisticians have the tools as well. how is statistics relevant for cer? and why is this type of research so interesting? 4.3 the place of statistics in comparative effectiveness research cer encompasses all the fundamentals of statistics: design, analysis, and inference. it is demanding and challenging. its potential for making a difference in patients’ lives is enormous. in terms of design, cer involves the synthesis of existing evidence, as well as the generation of new evidence. evidence may be generated via explanatory trials or pragmatic trials (zwarenstein and treweek 2009), observational studies, registries, administrative data, or distributed data networks. what evidence is appropriate and necessary to answer which question (atkins 2007)? statisticians can lead the way on cer design challenges. in terms of analysis, imagine that you and i have high blood pressure. consider having the results from one trial that compares blood pressure treatment a with placebo and the results from another trial that compares treatment b with placebo. let us assume that we must work from this available evidence. we do not have the time or resources to conduct a new trial. if we want to know how treatment a compares to treatment b, there is no head to head evidence available. how can we figure out which medication to take given the availability of only indirect evidence (song et al. 2009)? we do not know the best analytic method to use to answer this question. statisticians can lead the way on cer analysis challenges. in terms of inference, a false discordance has arisen between cer and personalized medicine (garber and tunis 2009). personalized medicine includes a patient’s characteristics such as age and possibly genomic data. the goal is to match the individual to the most appropriate treatment. cer has been characterized as driving all patients toward an “average” treatment that does not take into account individual differences; however, cer actually promotes personalized medicine by designing studies to allow for subgroup analysis and clinical prediction rules. as mark helfand stated: “ironically, the motivation for comparative effectiveness is to see what works in practice, rather than overgeneralizing from a few unrepresentative studies” (meier 2009). statisticians can lead the way on cer inference challenges. what can the asa do to support cer? cer is patientcentered. it is about providing information that matters to patients. if cer is to have a meaningful impact on patients’ lives, all must be statistically literate (wallman 1993). evidence is worth nothing if not translated into usable information and disseminated. the asa must continue to lead the way on statistical literacy. 5. summary tonight, i have emphasized three issues: • why individual statisticians should be involved in policy and how we might do so. • why the asa should be involved in policy and how the association might do so. • the impact that statistics can have on policy. tonight, i have asked you to take the journey from evidence to policy. almost everyone here has taken a car trip with a child. what does that child say after only a few minutes? right—“are we there yet?” “have we as individual statisticians and as an association informed policy to our full potential?” no, we’re not there yet. what i can tell you is we need to make this journey. what i can tell you is we know how. 6. closing my office is in the gertrude m. cox statistics building at rti international. professor cox was the 1956 asa president. every morning i walk past her portrait in the lobby. every morning she looks sternly at me, and her eyes follow me across the foyer. i always say “good morning, professor cox.” i am fairly sure that the security guard thinks i am crazy. what is important to me is the link to the past. professor cox’s presidential address is titled “statistical frontiers” (cox 1957). she describes taking a journey across three statistical continents: descriptive statistics, design of experiments, and analysis and theory. professor cox encourages her readers to travel these statistical continents “not as tourists, but as explorers” (cox 1957, p. 1). she speaks of an “unprecedented demand” (cox 1957, p. 10) for statistician explorers in new continents of opportunity. i believe that this demand still exists more than 50 years later, especially to provide and explain evidence for policy. i encourage you to be an explorer, and an example to others, in the journey from evidence to policy. as gandhi said, “become the change you want to see in the world.” on august 6, we as statisticians and as an association will march to congress. we will be the change we want to see in the world. if not you, who? if not us, who? if not now, when?",282,13.790780141844,4.88480329133453,0.277192080226279,3889,1078,14.5895870786671,9.58958707866705,85,0,"https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2010.ap09811"

we can accomplish this simply by being smarter, and more innovative. we may, for example, delegate more and more of the computational burden to machines via clever algorithms. some of this is happening at various companies already, whether it be business analytics at sas, or building a smarter planet at ibm. share your data. we must get researchers to collaborate, by sharing their data, and their programs. verification and validation are important for building trust in science. should we look to the heaven? cloud computing appears promising, although data transfer rates to and from the “cloud” must improve significantly. finally, we’ll need clever data visualization techniques to quickly communicate results of statistical analyses. in one example statisticians showed the pressure distribution at each point on a fighter aircraft using a colorcoded display of an aircraft; a big improvement over listing a massive array of measurements. (the image is included in the video of this address included as online supplemental material.) whether we use the bubble plots hans rosling talks about, or the various displays you saw in our marketplace here, presenting high dimensional data in a visually understandable format would be very important for our profession. the information management game is changing. as data proliferate, and computing becomes cheaper, analytics is becoming the “go to” tool. in classical formulations, we started with models and hypotheses and tested their validity using data. now, some just dump their numbers into a computing cluster and draw inferences based on patterns. some observers are predicting that the google way may become the only way! peter norvig from google offers an update to george box’s maxim: “all models are wrong, and increasingly, you can succeed without them.” chris anderson, in his 2008 article for wired magazine titled “the end of theory: the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete” writes, “the new availability of huge amounts of data, along with the statistical tools to crunch these numbers offers a whole new way of understanding the world. correlation supersedes causation, and science can advance even without coherent models, unified theories, or really any mechanistic explanation at all.” kevin kelly calls this “correlative analytics” in a 2008 post on his blog “the technium” ( thetechnium/ ) and argues that “these methods are not entirely model free, models may be invisible to some analysts.” i believe that statisticians will continue to take the lead in predictive model building, and go beyond correlation analytics. i agree with daniel hillis who, in a 2008 blog post responding to anderson’s article, said “the experimental method (hypothesize, model, test) is what allows science to get beyond what can be extrapolated from existing data. hypotheses are most interesting when they predict something that is different from what we have seen so far. models are interesting precisely because they can take us beyond the data.” as someone said, “some folk remedies work, and we don’t know why. science is about understanding. insight is more exciting than folk remedies.” 3. innovation with statistics let me now look at a sample of examples to highlight how statistics and statistical thinking continue to influence and change our lives. our members from government, academia, and industry are making a difference! mapping the human genome, gazing at the heavenly stars, designing a new aircraft, identifying traffic pumping in telecom networks, racial profiling, climate change, combination therapies, prescription patterns, and assuring data security all of these are some examples of statistical innovation. statistics benefits everyone. that’s why our goal must be, to give statistics to everyone. a. the human genome project identified the 20–25,000 genes in the human dna, sequenced the human dna, and stored all this information in databases. all these data can now be analyzed. but, the datasets are massive! this is where statisticians come in! one of the biggest achievements of the human genome project is that it has democratized data. together, we can now help find answers to some of the biggest questions of biology: what causes diseases? how do we discover new drugs? and perhaps even: why did i go bald? statisticians like alison motsinger reif at nc state and rebecca doerge at purdue are partnering with industry and government, in making it a better living for all of us. b. fifty, or even, 15 years ago, astronomers sought bigger and more powerful telescopes, so that they could extend their celestial gaze further and farther. now they want massive computing and data communication platforms. they also want statisticians to do cluster analysis to identify clusters in outer space and run simulations to understand how massive stars get formed. statisticians like jogesh babu at penn state are taking a lead in providing answers. c. when the boeing 747 jumbo jet was originally designed, they hardly used a computer and a lot of the design and testing involved a wind tunnel. in a remarkable reversal of roles, the boeing 777 and later 787 were entirely computer designed! today, the aircraft industry is one of the most sophisticated users of analytics and statistical modeling. statisticians, like bill meeker at iowa state, are working with engineers on the safety of planes we fly on. d. in the telecom business, data are everything. telecom data contain answers to most telecom riddles. the real problem is that these data are massive and overwhelming. there is so much data accumulating every minute at telecom switchboards that is hard to keep up with. the only way forward is to use large data warehouse appliances and clever analytics. these appliances can perform 50–1000 times better than conventional databases because of their optimized storage architectures and parallel processing algorithms. similarly, statisticians at google, microsoft, yahoo, and other places are developing innovative algorithms, to analyze internet traffic data, and help our searches to be faster, relevant, and meaningful. e. early in 2007, new york police department (nypd) released statistics that they had stopped half a million pedestrians, suspecting criminal intent, but 9 out of every 10 such pedestrians were nonwhite. rand corporation was invited to investigate the matter. they found small racial differences in the rates of frisk, search, use of force and arrest, and recommended corrective actions. one major finding was that 15 out of 2756 nypd officers were unreasonably contaminating the outcome. statisticians, like greg ridgeway and dan mccaffrey at rand, are helping resolve some hot button issues in our society. they may have new racial profiling work coming to them from arizona soon! f. weather forecasting ability is continually improving, but we are still not completely there. a great deal has indeed changed. improved measurement technologies, better data acquisition on finer sampling grids, massively parallel computers, super satellite imagery, coupled with statistical models, gps inputs, have all contributed to this improvement. we are able to predict weather better, and model the changing climate. g. not very long ago, market research was all about questionnaires, percentages, pie and bar charts, and cross tabs. market analysts are now working with statisticians, and becoming more innovative. by using sophisticated data mining procedures, they are now more likely to uncover that valuable and glittering diamond. all major pharmaceutical industries, like lilly, glaxosmithkline, merck, sanofi aventis, and pfizer, have new analytics divisions with leading statisticians in them. here is one example, where statisticians like qing yang at lilly used data mining techniques and found that product preference is the key driver for product prescription, but varies with prescriber market segment and medical specialty. furthermore, for this particular product, it was much more important to prescribers that the efficacy of the product was comparable to others, than that it was better than the rest, a finding that went against the conventional wisdom and surprised the marketing group. these discoveries provided a better understanding of the information prescribers need to make their choices with patients, along with an evidence base for the marketing group to incorporate into their planning decisions. this saved a significant amount of money for lilly. h. if you get it right, combination, or “cocktail” therapies, can enhance drug efficacies without increasing toxicity, and significantly enhance life expectancy as, for example, with the highly active antiretroviral treatment (haart) treatment for hiv. but, developing combination therapies isn’t easy, and outcomes of combination experiments are often difficult to interpret. fortunately, statisticians in industry and academia have developed sophisticated algorithms to untangle the many combination puzzles. i. the data security paradigms are changing, especially after 9/11. a decade ago, a lot of the data security analytics, involved searching for needles in a haystack. following an unusual event, we had to unearth all of the related data to complete the jigsaw. things are very different now! if we suspect that joe is covertly accessing financial data, or getting ready to blow up a plane, we don’t just scan the needle pointing towards joe. instead, we check anything and everything involving joe and his friends! for example, how many minutes did joe spend in the restroom and with whom? of course all this is possible, because we now generate massive data, increased communication among agencies, and have tools to mine such data. good data warehouse appliances can easily and quickly ferret out such information as long as we get multiple agencies to work together! the mandated requirement to digitize all health data, by 2015, poses stern challenges. data will grow from terabyte levels, to petabyte levels, and the diversity of data, and network architectures, could make data vulnerable. statisticians, at institutes like niss and samsi, and their visiting scientists are developing innovative methods for data security, quality, confidentiality, and disclosure limitations. j. government statisticians work hard and their innovations are at times under appreciated. so, let me digress a little and show my appreciation for their valuable contributions to our profession. there is much to celebrate, in official statistics with its many accomplishments. that’s why the recent census long form decision here in canada is unfortunate. i am, however, heartened by the reaction of many statisticians and in particular, the statistical society of canada, to educate policymakers and the public, on the many benefits of the census and on such important topics as sampling bias. closer to home, i am delighted that we have completed a very successful census in [the] u.s. on schedule and under budget, thanks to the hard work of many census workers who overcame significant setbacks and challenges. more broadly, u.s. statistical agencies should be commended for the achievement of the inclusion of a major federal statistics initiative in the next federal budget request. the omb–census–bls development of the supplemental poverty measure is a huge advance and, if funded, will be very beneficial. we also eagerly await the first release this fall of 5 year estimates, down to the tract level, from the community survey—the census product that now supplies the u.s. with the information formerly gathered via the long form. the “food environment atlas” of economic research service (ers), office of management and budget (omb)’s 2010 standard occupational classification manual, and “green jobs” definition by bureau of labor statistics (bls) are also great steps forward. with all these three letter acronyms, i am already sounding more and more like a national science foundation (nsf) employee, even though i don’t start there for another month. finally, it is a pleasure to congratulate the national center for health statistics, and its national health and nutrition examination survey for completing 50 years. federal statisticians and asa have a special synergy that i’m glad to see develop further in recent years. i am excited about the increased participation of agency statisticians in statistics seminars on university campuses. making students and faculty aware of the vibrant statistical research happening in federal statistical agencies is important and i hope such outreach can be further encouraged from both sides. the canadian census long form and the u.s. decennial census remind us the importance of educating the public about what it is statisticians do, and why it is helpful. we should especially take advantage of this in the year of the u.s. decennial census, and un’s world statistics day on october 20, 2010. 4. statistics then, now, and ahead we are doing good work solving interesting, hard, and useful problems, but we tend to stay “indoors”; we need to “reach out” more. as jon kettenring challenged us about the outreach in his asa presidential address in 1997, we were sensing this change and started preparing for a more intense public involvement, and a more dramatic and path breaking future. the questions that confronted us, and that we addressed, were varied and interesting. are we pointing the compass right? how do we become more visible? which will be the dominant philosophy? how do we support human welfare? how do we nurture excellence? how do we extract knowledge from massive datasets? how do we tell the world what we can do? how does statistics tie into policy? i feel very proud and honored that we are participating more actively today in this great statistical adventure. we’ve looked at several examples that show how statisticians have been innovative in a data centric world. in the future, we are going to need more of that innovation. we’ll have to successfully surf past the data tsunami, to help find better, more useful, and more efficient solutions, to the biggest problems we face today. to do that, we have to collaborate and communicate. we have to partner with doctors, scientists, engineers, lawyers, policy makers, and, yes, even politicians. many of them are our neighbors, or parents of our children’s friends. talk to them! think about it is anyone better placed than statisticians, to partner in national and global initiatives on health, climate, energy, and security? at the same time, we need to watch out. statisticians are an unfortunate species. we are the first ones to be blamed for mishaps, disasters, and falsehood. people from different professions can cheat with statistics but we get the blame! an experiment or a project may fail because of faulty strategy, or even faulty science, or someone’s ethical lapse, but it’s the statisticians who get the blame. statistical significance is questioned, the hapless p value is ridiculed, clinical trials are rubbished, statistical results are called illusions, and every effort is made, to tear statistical science, to shreds. tom siegfried in a science news article (march 27, 2010) “odds are, it’s wrong” blames statistics for a wide range of scientific failings. we have to continuously work hard, to get rid of these memes public have. as wayne dyer (being in balance, 2840) said, “memes are ideas placed in your brain by others. they spread like a virus, duplicate, spread and infiltrate.” getting rid off the memes must be a collective and continuing effort. i believe that we are about to enter the best of times for statistics, and for statisticians. dr. goodnight, in his asa presidential invited address yesterday, told us how we are entering the age of analytics. when the world is going to be swamped with so much data, surely statistics is the only way to go! i would personally like to see more and more data, and statistical and computational tools available in the public domain because that is the surest recipe for innovation. we can be more effective when we can compare and validate. i’m also a big votary of teaching and training because that is the best way to spread the statistical gospel. please teach well, especially in our introductory statistics courses. it may be the best and only chance we have at educating the public. plant the seeds early and we will reap the benefits in the future. i want to thank some of the asa staff and asa members for their hard work on common core standards and on statistical literacy. i also want to see more statisticians in decision making roles. i know you will agree with me, we bring to the table unique observations and insights that are tremendously valuable. statisticians must collaborate more deeply, and more intensely, with government, academia, and industry and this collaboration must start at the very beginning. far too often, we come in at the end when the die has already been cast. it is also abundantly clear that our future deliverables won’t be crunched numbers; we will be called upon to deliver attractive and intelligent digital imagery. our future encompasses multimedia content, not cold numbers. our community also needs a strong influx of new skills, and as many of you know, my heart is in developing a work force that includes women and minorities. all recent surveys indicate we are soaring up the ranks and the climate for our demand is hot, and getting hotter. today people are reaching out to us because they know that we can make statistics more digestible, and also find them those nuggets of gold, under a mountain of data, or at the end of a beautiful rainbow. no wonder hal varian of google, our economic outlook luncheon speaker, is calling us sexy! what the heck, some of our members, even “model genes.” 5. mantra for 2010 as many you know, my mantra for 2010 is: give to asa. we must grow our membership. we must show the impact of our profession. we must become more visible, and we must educate and develop future problem solvers. four working groups have come up with excellent suggestions to implement for the future. if we are all together, as president obama said, yes, we can! we can accomplish these goals. for us to have a significant impact and be visible, we must speak often, and clear. we must speak often, and timely. we must speak on issues like the canadian census long form. also, we have to fight memes and misconceptions through education. finally, i must also make a plea to the folks sitting here in the front row, waiting to become asa fellows. please be proud of your achievements, and stay members of asa, for life. we are proud of you. of course, this plea applies to the rest of you too! 6. a respectful closing! i cannot end this address, without paying a tribute to professor c. r. rao of isi and penn state. half a century ago, he was already the idol of every budding indian statistician; and nothing has changed even today. i feel blessed, and privileged, that i still enjoy his support, and abundant affection. we sometimes forget that this is the same rao of the rao–cramer inequality, and the rao–blackwell theorem. i also can’t end without recalling some wonderful memories of uc berkeley professor david blackwell who unfortunately passed away less than a month ago on july 8th, 2010. i have truly enjoyed my conversations at his home, especially in 2008, when i went to deliver him, an honorary doctorate degree from nc state. here was a person, who opened the doors for african scientists to the national academies, lived a very humble life, and was a role model for many of us. he overcame many obstacles in his life. i will cherish my discussions with david about our profession, about the asa, and about yet to be elected, president obama. he broke many glass ceilings to open the gates to many heavens for us. so let me close by borrowing some of professor blackwell and president obama’s words, “we are a key to innovation. we have much to celebrate in terms of diversity in all its forms—gender, backgrounds, preferences, abilities and sectors we represent, and celebrate all our contributions to advancing science. also, recognize we have much to accomplish, together.” so, let us continue to promote the practice and profession of statistics. and, “let us go, make a change!” thank you!

my mother was involved in community organizations and found herself elected president of a local volunteer group which raised funds for cancer patients. as president, she had to give a number of speeches, thanking her board for all of their help, thanking volunteers and donors and urging the members to get more members and to continue volunteering. and not being used to public speaking, she rehearsed her speeches over and over again in front of my father and me until we were bored silly and she got it right. when the real speech came, she surprised my father and me by thanking us for our support. so in essence, i have been preparing for this moment since i was about 10 years old. the theme of this meeting is statistics: an all encompassing discipline. the theme is based on a plaque found at the entrance of the asa office building. the plaque states the mission of asa: “to promote excellence in the application of statistical science across the wealth of human endeavor.” how well do we succeed? how does statistical science expand into new fields? do statistical contributions get the recognition we statisticians deserve? or do we make quiet, but sometimes brilliant, contributions in the background? one measure of success is that our asa sections reflect how all encompassing our discipline has become: the asa has 24 sections ranging from the sciences (e.g., biometrics, biopharmaceutical statistics, epidemiology, physical and engineering sciences, environmental statistics) to business (e.g., business and economic statistics, quality and productivity, marketing) to policy (e.g., government statistics, health policy statistics, defense and national security) to the social sciences (e.g., social statistics and survey research). as noted by sir david cox in his talk yesterday, what unifies us is not the subject matter we work in, but the methodology and the thought processes that help us solve the problems that arise in these many, diverse fields. we have the ability to see analogies and differences between the problem at hand and other work, to see how old theory can be extended to a new situation. since many of us have our primary training in statistics or perhaps biostatistics or computer science or even mathematics, our contributions to other scientific fields necessarily involve collaborative efforts with people whose primary discipline is other than our own. thus in order for statistics to be all encompassing, statisticians also need to be broadly educated and collaborative. a unique feature of being a statistician is that you may collaborate in any discipline whatsoever; and you may change fields of application as occasions arise. former asa president, sallie ann keller (2010) noted that statisticians are in increasing demand in science and have been moving from being consultants to becoming collaborators. she urged that universities and departments encourage the trend towards participation in interdisciplinary research. and she urged outreach, that we statisticians seek out collaborators and interdisciplinary opportunities. she encouraged “those in positions of influence” (including the asa president) to echo her call. my thesis is that the thought process is unique to the discipline of statistics and it is very difficult to for those outside the field to fully understand what we bring to the collaborative table. because of this, success depends upon developing the skills to make it easier for our colleagues in other disciplines to appreciate our contributions. these skills may be natural to some, but take learning and constant vigilance for others. they may have a western cultural bias, that is, it may be more difficult for those who grew up in countries other than in north america or western europe: whether fortunate or unfortunate, the emphasis is on form as well as substance. i come to this thesis from collaborating with biomedical scientists for about 30 years, but i hope the theme resonates with other disciplines as well. aspects of collaboration can be broken down into the initial contacts, moving from consultation to collaboration, and collaborating in large groups, all the while protecting ourselves from being considered the “go to” person who saves the day at the end of a study or the naysayer who just throws cold water on all of those nifty experimental designs. 2. how to begin? the initial contacts for a collaborative project are often initiated by someone who has a statistical problem. most of us have heard at least once, “here are the data i collected, so just tell me how i can analyze them to get my paper published,” or “how do we present these data in the most positive light possible?” both of these approaches are based on the assumption that the statistics are merely a tool to be used by a consultant to get to a result, rather than an intrinsic part of the creative process. so how do we convince our colleagues that we have more to offer than simply manipulation of data? one way is to act as a collaborator. this means that statistics is integrated into the project, perhaps just at the analysis stage now, but both in the experimental design and the analysis stages in the future. for this to happen the statistician must be fully engaged in the project. reading up on the field is essential: you can rely on that great compendium of wisdom, google, but that is less relevant and possibly less accurate than references supplied by your collaborator. actually, a combination of both is the best, since google provides a general overview that is often missing from research papers. the most creative aspects of collaboration occur when the collaboration is at the early stages of the project, and thus timing is essential. if the request for statistical assistance comes very late in the project, chances are you are being asked for advice on a paper that has already been refereed and possibly rejected. that is, you are being sought because the statistical analysis in the paper has been criticized and they need you so they can answer the criticism. you might offer references to appropriate methods and tips on how to implement them. if you are sure that they are capable, this takes far less time than performing the analysis yourself. if they protest that they cannot do the analysis, then the focus becomes finding a process that ensures the reliability of the results, and implies a deeper involvement that likely defines a collaboration. the deeper involvement means that statistics is not only used, it is publicly acknowledged in the presentation of the work. however, this leads to another point about statistics as a collaborative endeavor. 3. there’s no such thing as a free lunch what should statistics cost? and what’s the benefit? if it’s so essential for progress, it should not come cheaply, yet we are often faced with how much time and effort to put into a project, and at what return. of course, as asa members and subscribers to the asa mission, our goal is to promote the use of statistics in society. so there is no question that our primary obligation is to participate. however, unless it is your job to salvage the poorly conceived work of others, one needs to decide how much time to put into a project without any personal payoff. where to draw the line may differ in different settings. in a pay as you go setting (academic or quasi academic), one way to limit what is done without payoff is for the statistics group to have a rule on how much time a statistician can spend on a project which has no funding, say, no more than 3 hours. this rule can be invoked if a data analysis is requested and there is no agreement in place about payment or authorship. the “only three hours for free rule” may seem rigid and exceptions will be made. certainly one exception is preparation of the statistics section for a grant application which will lead to further collaboration. but the nice thing about a “three hour rule” is that it can always be invoked when you think someone is trying to take advantage of you. in some settings the only payoff is authorship on a paper resulting from the collaboration. assuring such authorship is granted may require explicit negotiations. these negotiations should occur early in the project. 4. communication in real estate it is said that the three most important things are location, location, location! in statistics, the three most important things are communication, communication, communication! collaboration requires communication, and communication is a two way street. if you don’t understand what your colleague is talking about you cannot make a contribution, never mind an optimal one. you have to ask questions, even if it makes you feel dumb. and you need to listen as well. i am reminded of the scene in the video by steve goodman where the man in the white coat, a medical researcher, and the statistical consultant each understand one or two key words, but each think the other is speaking perfect gibberish. if someone in another discipline doesn’t understand what you are talking about, they will think that asking statisticians for advice is like talking to a brick wall. so it is best to be able to communicate simply and clearly. the actor alan alda recently gave a talk at nih entitled, “look who’s talking: communicating your messages fearlessly and flawlessly.” he is currently working on science communication, but his ideas are relevant to statisticians as well. in his talk, he made the analogy that communication for scientists (and statisticians) is like a blind date. blind dates have three stages, “lust, infatuation, and commitment.” since everyone giggled when he said “lust” he explained that by lust he meant attraction. how should one initiate this attraction? you should think of an initial consultation as a human encounter rather than a scientific one. of course, it will be scientific as well. so if a relevant story comes to mind, don’t be afraid tell it. telling such stories facilitates the human aspects of the collaboration. a similar theme is echoed by randy olson (2009) in his book entitled don’t be such a scientist. olson emphasizes that there are two levels of perception, and i am paraphrasing here, intellectual and emotional, and that if you want to get your ideas across, you need to emphasize the emotional impact of your message. bertrand russell is quoted as saying, “the mark of a civilized (hu)man is the capacity to read a column of numbers and weep.” this suggests that statisticians must be very civilized, because so many datasets have made us weep! so our job is to educate both our collaborators and the public on the value of statistics and make the statistics have an emotional impact. when there is a natural disaster and 1200 people die, we find ourselves shocked and full of sorrow, but 1200 is also approximately the number of people who die every single day from smoking related health complications. the health statistic itself is dramatic, but combined with the comparison to the shock of a natural disaster, the information has greater emotional impact than the health statistic alone. but health statistics can also have an emotional impact—when people are presented with data showing how their lifestyle can impact their life expectancy, many will alter their behavior in positive ways. another part of randy olson’s book suggests that you should not be too cerebral. in some ways, this suggests that we simplify our data presentation in order to appeal to an uneducated audience. but we should not get so carried away with the emotional impact or simplicity of our data analysis presentation that we either get careless or overstate our results. and i need not remind you of the ever present dangers of oversimplification that go with the use of powerpoint. this has ethical implications. 5. know your data: ethical implications bourne and barbour (2011) recently published “ten simple rules for building and maintaining a scientific reputation.” they advise us to “be sure that the work on which you are a co author is accurate.” for the statistician, who is often not an expert in the subject matter field, be it biological techniques or medical procedures or something entirely different, like some aspect of electronics, this is a major issue. even without detailed knowledge, one must make sure that the data are not altered (fudged). one investigator brought datasets to two different statisticians on two separate occasions a few months apart. it turned out that the two datasets were almost coincident, except for the omission of a few patients on the second dataset. it was only a lunchtime conversation that made the two statisticians suspicious that they had received the same set of data and they undertook a comparison which revealed the similarity. while this event ended almost amicably (the investigator pretended it was an accident), such a situation today would provoke far worse recriminations. a recent paper by baggerly and coombes (2009) found simple but serious errors in microarray based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines which were used to predict patient response to cancer drugs. examples of “simple errors” are the reversal of drug sensitive and drug resistant labeling in the dataset, not aligning the values of some of the variables, and reuse of test data in the validation set. the initial discovery of these microarray based signatures of drug sensitivity had been cited by discover magazine as one of the top genetics stories of 2006. several papers have had to be retracted. these microarray based signatures had been used by others, had been the basis of a patent, and had been used to guide therapy in cancer clinical trials. these trials were stopped. here, inaccuracy had broad consequences beyond the scientists’ reputations. it was open source data that allowed baggerly and coombes to attempt to reconstruct the original analysis. according to the new york times (kolata 2011), the reconstruction took 2000 hours. in these days of team science, it is very hard to know who is responsible for the errors. it may appear that the glory of discovery goes to the senior members on the team, but you can be sure every author’s reputation suffers from the errors. data problems can be subtle. i served on the fda panels evaluating the safety of the drug avandia which is used to treat diabetes. the question was whether avandia should be implicated for producing an excess of cardiovascular events. i was quoted in the new york times as saying “the quality of the analyses far exceeded the quality of the data.” the comment was made about a meta analysis which noted that cardiovascular disease was not recorded in some of the early trials, possibly because the trials were of very short duration. good ways not to find an excess of long term adverse events is to not to record them altogether or not to follow up the subjects for long enough. of course, in the avandia case, it was impossible to get the data since the trials occurred a long time ago. the statistician is obligated to point out data issues, even subtle ones. another ethical issue is “stealth authorship.” readers make inference that if there is a statistician as an author on a paper, he or she performed or directed or at least had something to do with the analysis. i have found my name as an author on an abstract for something on which i contributed modestly but over a several month period. the deadline for submission was later that day. someone else performed the analysis and i was not involved at all. i had not seen a data analysis nor heard anything about the results prior to seeing the abstract. there was no time to review the analysis or results, so i asked for my name to be removed and it was. this illustrates that even an ongoing collaboration can provide unexpected issues. while collaborations arise routinely, to make statistics an allencompassing discipline, statisticians must keep an open mind. 6. keep an open mind most of the time statisticians are being sought out by others for consultation which might grow into collaboration with time. but of course we as statisticians can seek out collaborators in fields of application which interest us. it isn’t always so easy to move into a new field. say you are a faculty statistician interested in collaborating with someone in another area, say air pollution, because you have some interesting ideas for data visualization and analysis methods that include using several large datasets simultaneously. you could begin by attending relevant seminars in the environmental science department, ask an occasional question and begin to network with the environmental science faculty working on air pollution. informal conversations could lead to collaboration. you might begin by reading the air pollution and relevant statistical literature and seek out the author of a paper which you found especially interesting. unfortunately this process takes a lot of time, unless you are extremely talented in separating the wheat from the chaff. time is most valuable, especially for young faculty who need to publish in order to gain tenure. and, of course, the statistician who does this might be considered a dabbler, either by the environmental science department or, worse yet, by his or her own department. further, a collaboration might never even come to pass. the luxury of taking the initiative to work in a new field in which you have an interest and some ideas but no training is thus probably best left to senior academics. then i ran across a counter example. erez lieberman aiden is a mathematical biologist who was written up (hand 2011) because of his invention of a new discipline called culturenomics. he has devised methods to mine a database of the world’s books to show the evolution of language and he has produced very effective graphics to demonstrate the evolution of word use over time. aristotelian from the get go, he speaks hebrew and hungarian as well as english, had a computer repair business while in high school, studied math, physics, and philosophy at princeton. he has a master’s degree in history from yeshiva university which he paid for by teaching mathematics, a masters in physics from harvard, and spent one year in rabbinical school. he obtained his ph.d. in medical engineering and medical physics including genomics and bioastronautics at the broad institute in a joint program with applied mathematics at harvard. all of his papers are authored collaboratively. note that he does not appear to be a tenured faculty member, but of course in his case, it doesn’t matter. but most of us are not geniuses and are unlikely to invent a brand new field, so it is much easier to seek out new collaborations within the sphere of our own work. i once sought out an investigator at my institution who had published a paper in the new england journal of medicine which contained a statistical error. i did this after discussing the error with a senior scientist friend who told me to go and talk to the senior author on that paper and tell him that i could help him improve his research. it wasn’t easy to pay the visit, but it turned out that the statistical analysis in question had been done by a fellow in the lab, not a statistician, who had not only left the institution, but left the country. the senior investigator felt it wasn’t really his fault, neglecting the fact that he was ultimately responsible. the conversation went pretty well. i volunteered to undertake some data analysis to at least see if the published conclusions remained valid. fortunately they did. this led to further discussions about his research and over time this led to a very productive long term collaboration. some collaborations happen by surprise: you meet someone at a social event and begin to discuss what you do professionally. you ask him or her about their research, find it interesting and before long, you agree to meet again for further discussions. such serendipity has great potential to lead to collaboration. is this simply luck? while it is much easier to sit in your office and wait for collaborations to come to you, statisticians can be successful in initiating collaborations if they network properly. this means reaching out, such as by attending events that appear to have nothing directly to do with statistics, or perhaps nothing to do with your own research, such as the aaas meeting. such events should be regarded as opportunities to meet others who will turn out to have interesting problems. 7. recognition in the era of team science a lot of statistics in a collaborative setting entails working in large teams. beyond being a good collaborator, your personality will partly determine whether your role is to sit quietly in your office and produce wonderful results or to interact freely with your collaborators and with potential collaborators. many projects entail many investigators working together and coming from many different physical sites. the expense of travel means that conference calls are frequent and meetings less so. it is difficult to contribute when 20 people are on the phone and the call lasts only an hour. if you say nothing except your name when attendance is taken, you may well learn something from the call and feel like you’re doing your job. but from the point of view of others, the silent participant might as well not be on the call. we don’t gain recognition for our contributions when we are a perceived as a “silent partner.” it may be hard to make a contribution on such a phone call, especially for those with less experience, but you will find yourself more highly regarded and respected if you do. to get recognition in the setting of team science you need to make your contributions widely known. on some occasions it might be appropriate to volunteer to give a presentation at one of the team meetings about the statistical aspects of the project that you are working on. this, too, is not easy. if you do give a presentation think about it as if you were going to speak to your mother. she is very bright, but knows very little statistics. to be recognized for your efforts in the collaborative setting, the collaborators need to know how clever you have been. someone has said to me, that if you never think you are showing off, you probably are not doing a good enough job of gaining recognition. how do we assure that our good efforts at spreading the statistical word continue? 8. be a mentor with experience as a collaborator comes the opportunity to share your expertise by mentoring less experienced colleagues. nowadays those coming out of graduate school are likely to have some training beyond statistical training. begg and vaughn (2011) recently reviewed training of biostatisticians in the era of interdisciplinary research. they note that a number of top rated ph.d. biostatistics programs now essentially require a minor in a nonstatistics area, such as public health. as well, demets et al. (2006) have advocated training in the “soft skills” in our graduate programs so that students are better prepared to go out into the real world as practicing statisticians. no matter how good the preparation in graduate school, onthe job mentoring is essential. applied statisticians may not end up working in exactly the same field as the one they minored in; they need help gaining knowledge in a new nonstatistical field as well as in collaborating in the new setting. and since each statistician has his or her own style, junior colleagues should have the opportunity to work with several more senior colleagues to help them fashion their own style. shadowing more experienced colleagues on different projects with follow up discussions of what just transpired, allows questions to be answered before they are forgotten, as well as reflection on the session by both participants. yes, this takes time. all good things take time! we have made some good progress recently in the area of training and mentoring and i am optimistic that between the better preparation for collaboration and the growing need for statisticians, the next generation of statisticians will not have the image problems we have had even in the recent past. some small evidence of an improvement in our image is exemplified by the results of one of my initiatives this year, the “promoting the practice and profession of statistics” video competition. the youtube presentations that were submitted to our contest certainly illustrate a lot of young people happily engaged in statistics. while it is hard to predict if any of the videos will “go viral,” they are quite enjoyable and funny and the music is pretty good, too. asa (2011) will archive the videos so that they are broadly available. (see org/youtube/ index.cfm.) 9. conclusions i have been influenced in my thinking about collaboration by two authors, randy olson, a former tenured professor of marine biology who is now a filmmaker and author, who wrote, don’t be such a scientist (olson 2009) and twyla tharp, the dancer and choreographer, who wrote a book called the collaborative habit: lessons for working together (tharp 2009). i highly recommend these two books as aids to improve collaborations. statisticians make contributions to many disciplines, including our own. better interdisciplinary collaborations and seeking out opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration will provide us with challenging statistical problems as well as serving to improve these disciplines. in turn our discipline will be enhanced. the broader our collaborations, the more statistics will be appreciated as an all encompassing discipline. last, i would like to thank you all for being here. and i will end my talk as my mother would end her speeches. i thank our board of directors for their selfless contributions this year. i thank our many other volunteers and urge them to continue their activities on behalf of asa. if you have not yet become a volunteer, please do. i thank my husband for tolerating my many late nights devoted to asa and ron wasserstein for his mentorship. i also want to thank all those who have donated to asa and urge those of you who haven’t to do so. and i’d like to urge every member of asa to get a new member. after all, we too are a community organization, albeit a large one.",236,18.8601694915254,4.83531790608852,0.282633116153673,4451,1258,15.8824735157592,10.8824735157592,64,1.18392544454424,"https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2011.ap11592"

Rodriguez","2000-2020","﻿the 2012 asa presidential address building the big tent for statistics robert n. rodriguez 1. prologue for many years, it has been the custom for the past president of the statistical association (asa) to introduce the presidential address. the 2012 introduction, given by past president nancy l. geller, began with the following story: long ago, there was a mathematics professor at case western reserve university named frank ryan. dr. ryan taught an introductory course in probability and statistics, and he also happened to be the starting quarterback for the cleveland browns. inevitably, his dual career led to class scheduling conflicts during the fall, which were resolved by drafting a graduate student as the backup instructor. her name was nancy geller. eventually, dr. ryan was signed away from the browns by vince lombardi, the coach of the washington redskins. that happened in september, and nancy was asked to teach the course for the entire semester. among the students who had enrolled was an undergraduate whose name was bob rodriguez. so it was that nancy, abetted by coach lombardi, introduced me to the study of statistics. 2. introduction: statistical heroes when i took that first course, i had no idea where it would lead. i simply wanted to learn more. five wonderful years as a graduate student in statistics at the university of north carolina at chapel hill trained me in statistical theory. work at general motors research laboratories and at sas taught me the diversity of statistical practice. participation in asa activities led me to become a professional statistician. those were the key steps that transformed me from a beginning statistics student into a member of the statistics profession. at every step, i have been inspired by the heroes of our profession. every profession has its heroes. heroes are people who achieve great things in ways that encourage us in our own efforts to do great things. our profession has an extraordinary number of heroes. i believe this is true because statistics is the most unselfish of the sciences. statistics improves human welfare. statistics improves human welfare not by its own ends, but by its contributions in all fields. three of my statistical heroes are walter shewhart, frederick mosteller, and gertrude cox. they contributed in industry, education, medicine, public health, and government. all three were asa presidents. all are warmly remembered for the personal interest they took in the work of others. when i think about their concern for others and their vision for our profession, i am encouraged, motivated, and inspired. walter shewhart gave his presidential address in 1945. his theme was how statistics, working together with the sciences, could serve society. shewhart believed that if statistics could minister to all people and if the majority of people could understand this contribution, then the future of the statistical profession would be assured. to advance this goal, shewhart looked to the asa. his hope was that the asa would develop into a “strong organization to serve the common interests of all professional statisticians.” for me, fred mosteller personifies the kind of statistician that shewhart had in mind. mosteller used statistics in areas as diverse as anesthesia, presidential elections, and baseball. in 1961, he taught statistics to the public on nbc’s television program, “continental classroom.” the most influential hero in my career is gertrude cox. professor cox came to north carolina in 1941 and founded three departments at a time when there were few programs in statistics and few women in the field. she established the program that is today the department of statistics at north carolina state university. she recruited harold hotelling to form the department of mathematical statistics at the university of north carolina in chapel hill. and she encouraged bernard greenberg to start the department of biostatistics in chapel hill. sas began in 1966 at north carolina state as a project to analyze agricultural data. today, i am convinced that i would not have spent the last 29 years at sas if gertrude cox had not come to north carolina! because statistics serves society, each of us has the opportunity to be a hero. it doesn’t matter whether you work in research, teaching, applications, or software development. you always have ways to improve human welfare. you always have a place to encourage, serve, and inspire others. for us, there is no better place for doing this than the asa. there is no better time than now at the asa. there is no better way to start than by volunteering for the asa. i believe there is no greater opportunity to become a hero than here in our association. which one of you will be the next hero? the concept of the big tent i believe that today the strength of the asa is its ability to serve our members in the diversity of their statistical practice. our future strength over the next 25 years will be serving anyone who uses statistical methods to solve problems. these include problems that draw on new types of data in science, business, and policy making. regardless of whom we serve, whether they call themselves statisticians, scientists, or business analysts, we must convey the importance of statistical contributions. we must have the ability to explain, demonstrate, and prove that importance to students, to the media—and most of all—to society. we have become the world’s largest community of professional statisticians by serving the needs of statisticians in universities, industry, and government. yet today, the landscape for statistical practice is expanding quickly. we must ensure that statisticians of any type—regardless of training, experience, and area of practice—find value in becoming and remaining members of our association. in other words, the asa must become the big tent for statistics. how many of you are familiar with the term “big tent”? if you have children, it means a circus tent—a place where everyone finds enjoyment. if you follow politics, “the big tent” is a political party that includes many views. if you come to the north carolina state fair, you will see big tents that serve barbecue for meat lovers, fresh corn on the cob for vegetarians, and deep fried twinkies for thrill seekers. big tents do three things. they attract all kinds of people, they serve them on the inside, and they are highly visible on the outside. for us, the phrase “big tent for statistics” describes what we must become: the association that attracts all kinds of statisticians, serves them on the inside, and promotes their contributions on the outside. 4. your role in building the big tent this evening, you will hear about initiatives that are underway to build the big tent. we need your support as volunteers. when you hear about these initiatives, ask yourself “how can i make a difference?” can you create an activity in your section, chapter, or committee? can you organize a session? how can you make a difference? no matter what skills you have, we need you. contact the leaders of the initiatives and offer to help. as we prepare for the international year of statistics in 2013, followed by the 175th anniversary of our association in 2014, now is the perfect time to build the asa as the big tent for statistics. by volunteering, you will find yourself at the forefront of building the big tent. you will meet outstanding people, acquire new skills, and broaden your understanding of statistics. you will build your own strength as a statistician. you will build the strength of our association to promote our profession. by volunteering, you will build the strength of our profession to serve society’s needs. i believe that the asa must become the big tent for statistics, and i want to support this theme with three points. first, i will explain the purpose of the big tent. second, i will show you the progress we are making in building the big tent. third, i will describe the power of the big tent. 5. the purpose of the big tent you heard me say that the big tent must serve all kinds of statisticians. the purpose of the big tent is to serve statisticians in every area of practice. it is especially important to the future of the asa that we serve statisticians in new areas of practice. last year, i was invited by a statistics department to give a talk on new career opportunities for statisticians. afterward, one of the students in my audience came up and introduced herself. i will call her judy. judy was a student member of the asa, planning to graduate with a master’s degree in statistics. she was very excited about an upcoming interview with a big data company. judy had two questions for me, which i’ve been thinking about ever since: • can you tell me more about big data? • how do i become a data scientist? these are questions all of us need to think about because big data is a new area of statistical practice. we also have to ask ourselves a few more questions: • if judy doesn’t meet data scientists in the asa, where will she find mentors? • if judy doesn’t learn about big data in the asa, where will she go? • down the road, when the asa needs judy’s contributions, where will she be? to ensure that young people like judy find value in asa membership, we must become the big tent that serves all areas of statistical practice. that certainly includes areas that are strengths of our current members. that also includes areas that are new for us, such as informatics, business analytics, and—most recently—big data. these new areas are emerging because our society is data rich and data dependent. mckinsey global institute tells us that by 2018, the united states will need vastly more people with expertise in statistical methods. the additional number is between 140,000 and 190,000. more and more people outside of the asa are using statistics to solve important problems with new sources of data. these people include researchers, computer scientists, and data scientists. while many are doing innovative statistical work, they don’t call themselves statisticians. they don’t see the asa as the “go to” place for statistics. this is a serious disconnect! this is a disconnect that marginalizes our field at a time when statistics should be expanding to meet the needs of a data dependent society. this is a disconnect that limits the asa’s role in promoting the practice and profession of statistics. this is a disconnect that diminishes the asa’s ability to retain young people like judy. 5.1 what is big data? i want to suggest ways we can connect with the area of big data. before i do that, i want to go over a few things i’ve learned about big data. this is a new area for us, and after talking to judy, i felt i had to learn as much as i could. big data is new for us in three ways. first, big data is relentless. it is continuously generated on a massive scale. it is generated by online interactions among people, by transactions between people and systems, and by sensor enabled equipment. second, big data is relatable. it can be related, linked, and integrated to provide highly detailed information. that detail makes it possible for banks to introduce individually tailored services, for health care providers to offer personalized medicine, and for public safety departments to anticipate crime in targeted areas. third, big data is renowned. the new york times reports that big data is creating new business and transforming traditional business. the world of science views big data as the key to answering big questions. i was in washington this past march when the obama administration announced a big data research and development initiative. the initiative includes new funding opportunities supported by the national institutes of health and the national science foundation (nsf). yesterday, in the president’s invited address, dr. alan krueger, chairman of the white house council of economic advisers, listed big data as the first of his “six challenges for the statistics community.” the nsf is now hard at work on judy’s questions. it is encouraging universities to prepare the next generation of data scientists at all levels. 5.2 what is a data scientist? this is the term increasingly used for people who draw insights from large amounts of data. employers who hire data scientists tell me they need innovative problem solvers with expertise in statistical modeling and machine learning, specialized programming skills, and a solid grasp of the business. data scientists must also communicate what they learn from data. some of these skills are taught in statistics programs. in fact, data science is an interdisciplinary blend of statistical, mathematical, and computational sciences. 5.3 connecting with big data now that we have this background, how do we connect with the area of big data? there are three steps we can take. step 1 is to engage with data scientists outside of the asa who are involved in big data problems, research, and technology. many of you are thinking about sessions for the 2013 joint statistical meetings (jsm 2013). i ask you to organize interdisciplinary sessions about big data that cover challenging applications, collaborative research, and workforce training. the person to contact is your section program chair. step 2 is to explain why statisticians are essential. we must explain our unique contributions to consumers of big data and to the media. i ask you to take every opportunity to explain what sets us apart from mathematical and computational scientists. explain that we bring statistical thinking into the picture. explain that statistical thinking sets us apart in three ways: • like others, we look for features in large data—and moreover we guard against false discovery, bias, and confounding. • like others, we build statistical models that explain, predict, and forecast—and moreover we qualify their use with measures of uncertainty. • like others, we work with available data—and moreover we design studies to produce data that have the right information content. most of all, be sure to explain that we make a difference because big data on its own does not guarantee reliable answers to the big questions. step 3 is to provide training that prepares our members to work with big data. for example, because so much big data comes from sources such as mobile phones, social networks, and health records, we will need the ability to analyze unstructured text data. i ask you to organize tutorials for jsm 2013 that introduce statisticians to topics such as text analytics. the person to contact is the jsm 2013 program chair, bhramar mukherjee. if we engage with other disciplines, if we explain our contributions, and if we educate our members, we will see results. many of you will make important contributions with big data. all of us will see data scientists in the big tent. and one of them will be judy. 6. progress toward the big tent i’ve spent some time giving you the concept of the big tent. what i find exciting is not the concept, but seeing what volunteer members are doing to make the concept a reality. several years ago, i heard about a new executive briefing center that was being built on the sas campus. i heard it would be huge, nearly 300,000 square feet, with state of the art technology, and yet i had a hard time picturing it. then one day i ran into the supervisor who was in charge of the construction. when i asked her about it, she offered me a tour of the project. i had to wear a hard hat for safety, and the site was noisy and dusty. nonetheless, as we walked around, i began to see a lot more than concrete, steel, and cables. i saw how people would someday use the design, the space, and the technology. i saw myself there. and i couldn’t wait to get back and tell my friends about it. that’s how i feel about the big tent. i want to share my excitement by giving you a tour of the big tent construction site. of course, you won’t have to wear a hard hat tonight! 6.1 completed construction as we enter the construction site, i’d like you to see two goals that we’ve reached after several years of work by our members. our accreditation program is fully up and running. accreditation recognizes the training, experience, and ethical standards for competent statistical practice. if you know people whose work would benefit from this recognition, encourage them to apply! accreditation is value that will bring them into the big tent. accreditation adds visibility to the big tent because it says to society that statistics is a job for skilled professionals. we also have a new conference. this winter, we held our first annual conference on statistical practice, which we created to deliver the skills, knowledge, and experience needed for successful practice. the conference also serves new areas such as business analytics. feedback this year was absolutely positive. one person told me, “i’ve been waiting 20 years for a conference like this!” he won’t have to wait so long for the next one. it is scheduled for february 21, 2013, in new orleans. mark that date and tell others about this conference! students will learn about new career areas. experienced statisticians will sharpen their skills, update their knowledge, and gain fresh insights. 6.2 newer construction now, let’s move to some newer construction. around here, you’re going to have to watch out for wet paint, loose nails, and forklifts driving around. last year, i started four presidential initiatives. for each of these initiatives, i’ll give you a contact person so that you can pick up some power tools and help out. my first initiative is planning for the 175th anniversary of the asa in 2014. we are the second oldest professional society in the country. because this anniversary is a major milestone in the long life of our association, we have a lot to celebrate and everyone should be involved. a group headed by christy chuangstein is generating ideas for the anniversary and is working with chapters, sections, and committees to coordinate their activities. i challenge all of you to contribute activities that energize our future by making the asa the big tent for statistics in the next 25 years. contact our executive director, ron wasserstein, with your ideas. my second initiative is to provide asa training in career success factors. when i began planning my initiatives, i decided to learn more about needs in new areas of statistical practice. i invited executives from several major corporations to spend an afternoon at asa headquarters. i asked how the asa could serve the needs of their statisticians. every executive said the same thing: “please provide training in soft skills. the statisticians we hire need communication skills to explain the importance of their work to the rest of the organization.” in fact, many asa members would benefit from better skills for communication and for influencing others. to meet these needs, a group led by robert starbuck is developing training in presentation skills and leadership. the goal is to offer this training next year to local asa audiences. i ask you to participate when the training becomes available. sign up for it. sponsor it in your chapter, your department, or your company. for young people, this is training that will get your career off to a fast start. for those with experience, this is training that will make you more valuable to your organization. my third initiative is to strengthen master’s degree programs in statistics and biostatistics. a group chaired by john bailer is recommending learning outcomes for master’s degree programs. these are based on input from employers and recent graduates about knowledge that benefits statisticians on the job. if you teach in a master’s degree program, i encourage you to contact john bailer. applying these outcomes will help you equip your students for success after they graduate. my fourth initiative enables you to tell others about important new developments in our association. during the last 3 years, we have accomplished significant goals such as the new conference on statistical practice. now, we need to make sure everyone knows about them. we need to inform our local statistical communities about the most exciting developments in the asa. a group led by jeri mulrow has prepared attractive presentation slides that you can present to your chapter or your department. we call these messages “in reach communication” because they are for our own members, colleagues, and students. if you are a chapter officer, i ask you to include these messages in your meetings. contact jeri mulrow or ron wasserstein for more information. when you get home, your friends are going to ask you what you did at jsm. tell them you took a hard hat tour. tell them many volunteers are building the big tent for statistics. tell them anyone can volunteer. tell them what excited you the most. 7. power of the big tent i’ve talked about creating a big tent that serves all kinds of statisticians. you’ve done the tour and seen the construction of the big tent. none of that will mean anything if the people who come to the big tent don’t make it their permanent professional home. the power of the big tent is the personal value that someone finds inside. it is what drives someone to look at what we’re doing and say, “me too!” i had a wonderful opportunity to explain this on sunday. the committee on minorities held a diversity workshop for students and recent graduates, and i was invited to tell these young people what they will gain by actively participating in the asa. this week, all of you have seen young people here at jsm. you’ll see a lot more of them on the dance floor tonight! tomorrow morning, i’d like each of you to do one thing for me. find a couple of these young people and buy them a cup of coffee—they’ll probably need it! sit down and talk. ask about their interests. then tell them about three values they will find by participating in the asa. the first value is the power to remain in demand. the students i meet are career minded. they know statistics graduates are in demand. they want to know what will keep them in demand after they leave school. young professionals will need to keep up with statistical theory, methodology, and applications. they will need to know about new data, new problems, and new computational technology. they will need to develop skills in collaboration, communication, and leadership. the best place for young people to keep learning is the asa. here is where they will learn from outstanding researchers and teachers. here is where they will learn to serve and to lead. here is where they will learn from you. that has always been my experience. i’ll never forget my first asa short course; the instructors were john tukey and fred mosteller. many of you here tonight have helped me become a professional statistician. i deeply appreciate your teaching, your wisdom, and your encouragement. the power to remain in demand will bring young people into the big tent. what will challenge and engage them for the long run? that is the second value. it is the power to become purpose driven. it means coming to work with a broader view of what you are accomplishing as a statistician. you perceive your career as far more than designing experiments, analyzing data, and writing papers, because those activities are now the means to a greater end. purpose driven statisticians do better science, they transform business, they inform public policy, and they empower students. for young people who seek to be part of something bigger, the asa is the best place for them to meet outstanding statisticians who are purpose driven. this evening, you and i are surrounded by role models, including the new fellows we are recognizing and those who are receiving awards. there is a third value we can offer to young people. that is the power to reach higher with our profession. we reach higher by influencing the use of statistics in policy decisions at the national level. this matters to the young people i meet. they need to hear what we are doing to promote better use of statistics in education, science, and policy. here are three examples of how we are reaching higher: • asa members are influencing the way statistics is taught at the k–12 level in the 48 states that have adopted the common core state standards. here we have reached higher by working as an association. none of us could do this on our own. • this winter, several asa members went to capitol hill and participated in climate science day for the second year in a row. here, the outcome of reaching higher is better informed legislation. • a number of our members with expertise in forensic science have reached higher by meeting with senate staff members to advocate for improving forensic science. last week i wrote to senator john rockefeller supporting a bill he is proposing to reform forensic science. i believe the power of the big tent gives us the ability to engage and retain the young people who are the future of our association. we must show them that the asa gives all of us the ability to remain in demand, to become purpose driven, and to reach higher. young people who draw on the power of the big tent will gain personal success. they will experience that moment of transformation when statistics becomes more than a job. they will experience a greater scope of accomplishment. the power of the big tent also benefits those of us who have lived in the asa for many years. we will see an even stronger association when the next generation understands the broad purpose of statistics. we will see better policy decisions when the next generation joins us in advocating for statistics in high level decision making. 8. closing: strength through service today, the strength of our association is the ability to serve our members in the diversity of their statistical practice. our future strength, as we look to our 200th anniversary, will be serving anyone who solves problems with statistical methods. regardless of whom we serve, we must always convey the importance of statistical contributions to students, to the media, and—most of all—to the public. you have heard about our progress in building the big tent. you have taken the tour. now is the perfect time to join in. start by contacting the leaders of the initiatives you heard about or our executive director, ron wasserstein. by becoming the big tent for statistics, our association will gain the vigor, the vitality, and the visibility it needs for the next 25 years. at the 200th birthday of our association, our members will celebrate what we accomplished in the big tent for statistics. above all, they will celebrate what our profession accomplished to improve human welfare and serve society’s deepest needs. look around this room. look at the people in your rows: to your left and to your right. look around and notice all the people in the professional home we call the asa. as you notice all those people, think about what i said earlier. you heard me say that statistics is the most unselfish science. you heard me say that asa’s strength today is serving members in their diversity of practice. you heard me say that our future strength, as the big tent for statistics, is serving anyone who uses statistical methods to solve problems. here is what i believe you should see as you look around the room. you should see unlimited opportunity. you should see unlimited opportunity to serve within the asa. you should see unlimited opportunity to serve society. for me, one of the greatest examples of serving society is an olympic champion named eric liddell. it seems appropriate to talk about him this week because the news is all about the olympic games. the media haven’t quite figured out that the olympics are only the second most exciting meeting in the world! during the 1924 olympics, liddell won the gold medal in the 400 meter race. he set a new world record with a time of 47.5 seconds. although liddell ran for great britain, he is also listed as an olympic champion by china because he was born there in 1902. for some of you, eric liddell is the main character in the film chariots of fire, which won four academy awards in 1981. the film ends where the real story begins. after the 1924 games, liddell returned to china, where he taught science and sports. when japanese invaders reached his area of china in 1943, he was placed in an internment camp for civilians in the city of weifang. there, he constantly served others. he taught, he helped the elderly, he made sure food was distributed fairly, and he organized sports activities for the children. he encouraged everyone. eric liddell never left that camp. he died of illness in 1945, only a few months before the camp was liberated. before he died, he was offered freedom in a prisoner exchange. instead, he gave his place to a pregnant woman, trading his life for two. the story does not end there. in weifang, where the camp once stood, there is now a middle school. it is a place of learning where eric liddell is honored by teachers, students, and his former pupils. they do not remember him as a great athlete. they remember him as a hero who dedicated his life to helping others. eric liddell gives each of us a gold standard for service. as individuals, we can follow his example by serving others wherever we happen to be. as asa members, we can follow his example by serving our profession. as professional statisticians, we can follow his example by serving society. the average person looking at the asa from the outside does not see the opportunity we have to make a difference in the world. nor is it likely that you were thinking about that today as you attended technical sessions. we see the opportunity in the big tent for statistics when we view our profession the way in which walter shewhart, fred mosteller, and gertrude cox did. we see statistics serving society in every field. we see that opportunity in everyone here this evening. the future of our profession is unlimited if we grow the opportunity for statistics to meet the needs of a data dependent society. i challenge each of you to serve our profession as walter shewhart, fred mosteller, and gertrude cox did. i challenge each of you to serve others as eric liddell did. i challenge each of you to become a hero. that’s what the big tent is all about!",368,14.1739130434783,4.7118481595092,0.224884969325153,5216,1173,13.2079181114964,8.2079181114964,40,1.76400585697471,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2013.771010"

International Year of Statistics: A Celebration and a Call to Action",2013-08-06,"Marie Davidian","2000-2020","﻿a critical juncture we are almost two thirds of the way through 2013, the international year of statistics. statistics2013, as it is also known, is a year long recognition of the impact of our discipline on science and society. almost daily, events are taking place across the globe highlighting the contributions of statistics to just about everything—improving human health, understanding our environment, and informing decision making in business and in government. all of us here in this room know the importance of our field. statistics2013 is devoted to sharing that knowledge—with fellow scientists, industry leaders, government policymakers, students, the media, and the public. raising awareness of how statistics and statistical thinking affect every one of us will expand opportunities for us to make a difference. and it will attract students to the study of statistics, which is essential to meeting the demands posed by this new, data driven age. and, ultimately, it will increase the ability of the public to make sense of what those data mean to them. when it came time for me to choose the theme for these joint statistical meetings (jsm), i naturally chose “celebrating the international year of statistics.” because we have much to celebrate! at the same time, our discipline and our profession are at a critical juncture. on the one hand, statistics and statisticians have been getting a good deal of attention recently, in the media and among students in particular. on the other hand, our field has been nearly invisible in key arenas, especially in the ongoing discourse on big data and data science. at no time have statistical principles and our skills been more relevant or more essential, which makes the disconnect between our field and this discourse of great concern. tonight, i would like to take you on a brief tour of both sides of this story. i hope to convince you of why i say we are at a crossroads that demands that we take action. and i hope to inspire you to join in the efforts of our association, the statistical association (asa), in confronting this challenge. i will do this by discussing three things. first, i will present examples of both the positive attention and lack of visibility recently afforded to our discipline. second, i will describe what the asa has done and is doing to capitalize on the positive attention and to address the disconnect. and how the international year is promoting the role of statistics throughout society (and how 2013 became the international year in the first place). finally, i will turn to what we—as individuals, an association, and a profession—can do, in the rest of this year and beyond, to ensure that statistics and statisticians are at the table. making the contributions for which we are uniquely qualified as the data revolution evolves. 2. visibility and lack thereof 2.1 visibility of statistics you may not remember where you were four years ago this week. but chances are you were at the 2009 jsm in washington, dc, the most highly attended jsm ever, with more than 6800 participants. on the last day of the meeting, an article appeared in the the new york times entitled, “for today’s graduate, just one word: statistics” (lohr 2009). it spoke of the “rising stature of statisticians” and of the growing interest in the field, inspired by the “data surge.” but what really made this article resonate with our community was the now immortal quote by hal varian, chief economist at google: “i keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. and i’m not kidding.” that statement has been repeated in the media and within our profession enough times that, four years later, being “sexy” has become almost tiresome. but it is hard to complain. since then, similar media accounts have highlighted our discipline, with titles like “what are the odds that stats would be this popular?” in 2012 (hardy 2012) in the the new york times and “the allure of the statistics field grows” in the boston globe (teitell 2012), for which asa past president bob rodriguez and i were interviewed at the end of the last year. carl bialik, “the numbers guy” who writes a column and blog for the the wall street journal, has devoted several of them to statistics. last december, he discussed the importance of statistics and statistical literacy and gave a plug for the international year (bialik 2012). in march, he focused on the surge of interest in statistics among college students and the continuing growth in participation of high school students in the advanced placement statistics exam (bialik 2013). indeed, as bob noted in one of his amstat news columns last year (rodriguez 2012), the numbers of undergraduates seeking to major in statistics on many campuses have been increasing dramatically. the single most influential event drawing attention to our field was the 2012 u.s. presidential election. nate silver, who spoke to us yesterday, turned the political world on its head with his spot on, state by state predictions of the outcome on his fivethirtyeight blog, using statistical modeling! not only has nate become a veritable rock star, but he and his best selling book, the signal and the noise: why so many predictions fail but some don’t (silver 2012), have enlightened the media and the public about the power of statistical data analysis. he will be doing even more of that on espn, where he and his blog are moving later this year. in fact, the media focus is international. i spoke in early january at the international year kick off event in belgium. the regional newspaper sent a reporter and a photographer, and geert molenberghs and i were interviewed at length. i cannot resist showing you the result: a full page article. it is in dutch, but you get the idea. the interest in statistics has not been confined to the popular media. for example, the february 9, 2012, issue of nature featured an article about the shortage of statisticians with the requisite skills to address genomic data challenges, stating that “statistical expertise has become more valuable than ever” (hayden 2012). i could cite many more such accounts, just in the past year. if one relied solely on the proliferation of these, one would conclude that statisticians are the most sought after people on the planet and are critical to advances in science, business, and industry. of course, we are. however, when it comes to reports covering big data and data science, we are conspicuously absent from many of them. 2.2 invisibility of statistics the term big data describes datasets that are so massive, complex, and intensive that traditional data management, processing, and analysis tools are infeasible. these data arise in business, scientific research, and government—from social networks, retail transactions, internet searches, and electronic medical records—and in genomics, meteorology, astronomy, military applications, and a host of other areas. and what is data science? this emerging field is described as a blend of computer science, mathematics, data visualization, machine learning, distributed data management—and statistics—often in the context of big data. its practitioners are portrayed as not only data analysts but as innovative problem solvers who are adept at handling and processing massive data. who can create insightful visualizations. who are so wellversed in the subject matter that not only do they uncover the story the data are telling, but then they use that story to advance domain knowledge. and who are superb communicators who are indispensable guides to business and scientific leaders. clearly, no one person can excel at all of these things. so, realistically, data science should be an interdisciplinary team endeavor involving statisticians. but while this much of the description sounds like a statistician, some of the skills mentioned are not possessed by many of us. count me as one of them. understanding of parallel computing, distributed data management, optimization on a massive scale, new visualization tools, proficiency in programming and scripting languages, and the ability to work with unstructured text data, such as those aris ing from social networking interactions and electronic medical records. but statistical skills are of course also critical to data science. a recent report from the national academies of science entitled “frontiers in massive data analysis” (national research council 2013) states that “statistical rigor is necessary to justify the inferential leap from data to knowledge” in the massive data context. the report emphasizes the need for major new research efforts in statistical modeling, analysis, and design. nonetheless, we are missing from the public conversation. accounts of data science appear almost daily in the popular and scientific press. but in many of these, our field is not being connected with this area. entire articles on data science in which the words “statistics” or “statistician” never appear are not uncommon. if statistics is mentioned, it may in passing. and often not as a contributing scientific discipline but rather as “tools” that a data scientist might use. conventional statistical methods may be cited as not applicable to massive data structures or as too prescriptive. computer scientists, physicists, and others are often highlighted as the innovative, “go to” people for businesses and scientists with big data challenges. a new york times article in april (miller 2013) heralded the rise of data science, calling it “an emerging academic discipline” that is “so new (that) universities are scrambling to define it and develop curriculums.” the article cites numerous examples of the formation of centers, institutes, and degree or certificate programs. statistics is not identified as one of the key, relevant sciences. instead, it is mentioned only as a skill and a course that might be required. i have heard from many of you about presentations by campus, business, or agency leaders regarding new, data oriented initiatives in which the words “statistics” or “statisticians” were never used. about university centers for big data and data science being conceived without consultation with the department of statistics. and about university administrators who have distinguished statistics from data science as a “traditional” field whose “tools” are not relevant to the new big data challenges. i know that many of you are baffled by this disconnect. i know i am. particularly given the positive press our field has otherwise enjoyed. as larry wasserman says in a post on his blog, normal deviate, “the very fact that people can talk about data science without even realizing there is a field already devoted to the analysis of data—a field called statistics—is alarming.” (wasserman 2013). some members of our profession have expressed fear that departments of statistics could become obsolete if we do not act more aggressively to enter the data science arena. others are skeptical, citing previous “hype” surrounding topics like data mining and neural networks, arguing that “this too shall pass.” this time, things may be different. last march, the obama administration announced the “big data research and development initiative,” allocating more than $200 million in federal funding for research, workforce, and technology initiatives. this past may, the white house office of science and technology policy (ostp) held a big data workshop, attended by noted leaders in the data science movement. another will be held in october. the national institutes of health (nih) has created an agency wide position, associate director for data science. the nih has announced a “big data to knowledge” (bd2k) initiative, which “aims to facilitate broad use of biomedical big data,” and just two weeks ago allocated $24 million in annual funding for big data research “centers of excellence.” the investments of the u.s. government alone suggest that big data and data science are here to stay. of course, complaining that data science is forging ahead without the benefit of our unique understanding of bias, confounding, false discovery, and uncertainty will not get us very far. we as a discipline must become more engaged. i will discuss ways we can do that shortly. one final example illustrates an additional facet of the disconnect. many of you may remember the february 11, 2011, issue of the journal science. science is published by the association for the advancement of science (aaas). the aaas is the world’s largest general scientific society, with 120,000 members. and science is one of the world’s most prestigious general science publications. that issue was dominated by a special section devoted to “data.” but the words “statistics” or “statistician” were hard to find in the numerous articles and columns. this omission led to a meeting between several representatives of the asa and alan leshner, the chief executive officer of the aaas. dr. leshner was candid, telling his visitors that, “my impression is that many scientists view statistics not so much as a science but as a ‘bag of tools.’ ” he encouraged our field to engage fellow scientists and make the case otherwise. many of us have domain science collaborators who have immense respect for our contributions. but many of us have also encountered this view of our discipline. this incident demonstrated how widespread it might very well be. i will discuss steps our association is taking to challenge it. by now, most of us have heard about the 2011 report by the mckinsey global institute, a respected consulting firm (mckinsey 2011). the report projects the need for up to 190,000 more people with serious data analytic expertise in the u.s. by 2018. i do not think you will argue with me if i assert that many, if not most or all, of those individuals should be statisticians or should have considerable background in statistics. 3. raising awareness i have just spent the last several minutes on some pretty heavy stuff. do we really have a serious visibility problem? i think that the answer is, “yes, and no.” on the one hand, we continue to play our critical roles as collaborators and researchers, and students are clamoring to major in our discipline and apply to our graduate programs. but on the other hand, we continue to be missing from the big data/data science conversation. and we do not have the recognition we deserve from some of our fellow scientists. in addition, long standing misunderstandings of the principles of statistics persist in the public sphere. my favorite example has to do with recent congressional actions aimed at eliminating the community survey (acs) conducted by the u.s. census bureau. the acs samples a small percentage of the u.s. population each year and asks a detailed series of questions. participation is mandatory, and the results are used to allocate over $400 billion in funding. and private businesses use them for projection and planning. as reported in the new york times last may (rampell 2012), one house member advocating elimination of the acs remarked, “we’re spending $70 per person to fill this out. that’s just not cost effective, especially since in the end this is not a scientific survey. it’s a random survey” (emphasis mine). let me turn now to my second topic, what our association, the asa, and the international year of statistics are doing to confront these challenges. 3.1 the asa the asa is the second oldest continuously operating professional society in the u.s., founded in boston in 1839. only the philosophical society, founded by benjamin franklin in 1743, is older. we will be celebrating our 175th anniversary next year. we have 19,000 members in more than 90 countries and are the world’s largest community of statisticians. as bob discussed in his presidential address last year, we aspire to be “the big tent for statistics” (rodriguez 2013) which serves the needs of all who practice and use statistics. since 2008, we have had a formal strategic plan. it was updated in december 2012, and is organized around two main themes: “the asa as ‘the big tent for statistics’ ” and “increasing the visibility of the profession.” the plan is available on our web site. the second theme calls for stimulating awareness of the role of statistics and statisticians in science, government, and business and promoting the need for sound statistical practice to inform public and science policy. objectives that speak directly to the issues i have raised. in the past five years, the asa has added two key staff positions whose responsibilities focus on these objectives. one resulted from an initiative launched by 2006 president sallie keller to enhance asa’s role in science policy, which became part of the strategic plan. in 2008, steve pierson joined the asa as our first director of science policy. steve has worked tirelessly to elevate awareness of statistics. i encourage you to visit the “policy & advocacy” section of the asa web site to see the results of his efforts. i will highlight just a few. steve was instrumental in the involvement of expert statisticians in the annual climate science day on capitol hill, held annually since 2011, highlighting the key contributions of statistics. he has promoted asa’s activities in urging forensic science reform. steve has worked with the senate office of education and training to bring talented statistician instructors to capitol hill to teach statistical principles to congressional staff through our association’s “stats for staffers” series. he has forged ties with the white house ostp and has arranged opportunities for asa leaders to participate in big data workshops. and to meet with ostp leaders to emphasize the importance of statistics in data science. steve also writes columns and blogs to keep asa members and the public informed. he is the force behind asa board statements and letters to government officials highlighting the role of statistics. in fact, as part of our efforts to alter the perception of statistics among aaas members, steve advocated for the opportunity for tom louis and me to write a science editorial on statistics, which appeared last april. this last success inspired me to propose a broader initiative to raise the profile of statistics among scientists, focusing on doing this first within the aaas. the asa president elect formulates several initiatives every year based on the themes in the strategic plan, and this is one of mine. you may know that aaas has 24 sections, including section u on statistics, founded by jerzy neyman. and that section u celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. a workgroup of members of both aaas and asa, including section u officers, has spearheaded a campaign to encourage statisticians to join aaas and participate in aaas activities—the more of us there are, the more of a voice we will have. so far, section u membership is up to 14%. and statistics students entering the challenging aaas student poster competition at the 2013 aaas annual meeting won two of the four prestigious travel awards. at that meeting, section u sponsored six, standing room only invited sessions, which competed against sessions from across the spectrum of science for inclusion on the program. and at least three section u sessions have been accepted so far for the 2014 program. you may recognize these buttons from this and the last jsm. if you interact with other scientists in your work, i encourage you to join aaas and contribute to this ongoing outreach effort. last year, with the international year of statistics looming and the 175th anniversary right behind, the asa board recognized that the asa could no longer go without full time public relations assistance. jeff myers joined us in 2012 as public relations coordinator. jeff immediately got to work undertaking extensive outreach to the media. he has issued press releases on statistics2013 and the contributions of statisticians in a host of areas. these have spawned inquiries, and jeff has worked quickly to connect journalists to statistician experts. and to identify opportunities for asa leaders to be heard in the media. jeff has reached out to other organizations, including aaas, and discussions of joint initiatives are ongoing. an especially exciting development is the asa huffington post blog. seeing jeff’s many press releases, the huffington post contacted him about the possibility of a blog on statistics. jeff recruited me to write the first two posts. since then, he has identified a diverse range of topics and enlisted notable members of our profession to contribute entries. the latest, on data science, is by joel greenhouse (greenhouse 2013). jeff is working with asa executive director ron wasserstein to undertake an extensive public relations campaign for 2014. these are just some of the many ways jeff is helping us to explain the power of statistics to the public. 3.2 statistics 2013 jeff has also played a major role in the international year of statistics. he coordinates much of the content on the statistics2013 web site, org. if you have not had the opportunity to explore the site, i encourage you to do so. it is an engaging, comprehensive introduction to the contributions of our field, featuring continually updated articles, blogs, teacher resources, and career informa tion. the hope is that this wonderful resource will be maintained in perpetuity. how did 2013 get to be the international year of statistics? believe it or not, it started with chemistry. i am sure that you all know that 2011 was the international year of chemistry. my former department head, sastry pantula, who also happened to be 2010 asa president, heard about this during a department head’s meeting. if you know sastry, you know that the wheels started turning before he left the room. sastry immediately shared his idea with ron. and the international year of statistics was born. and quickly became a collaboration of six founding organizations: asa, the institute of mathematical statistics (ims), the international biometric society (ibs), the international statistical institute (isi), the bernoulli society, and the royal statistical society (rss). a steering committee of nine representatives from these organizations worked tirelessly to create the web site, spearhead events, and encourage worldwide participation. we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. in november, a capstone event, the future of the statistical sciences workshop, will be held in london. the workshop will chart a vision for the future of our discipline. anyone will be able to view it online live and after it takes place. this event is just one more example of efforts to promote and advance our discipline. statistics2013 now has well over 2000 global participating organizations. that number continues to grow. and the international year continues to bring recognition to our field. in fact, if you visit the sas campus in cary, north carolina, you will see these banners lining the main campus drive. every business leader and data science guru who visits sas sees them, too. and steve pierson deserves a major round of applause from all of us. his persistence in engaging the staff of my senator, kay hagan, has paid off. as you saw on the cover of the july amstat news, in may, senator hagan introduced u.s. senate resolution 150, “to designate the year 2013 as the ‘international year of statistics’.” steve also was instrumental in encouraging rep. jerry mcnerney of california, who holds a phd in mathematics, to present a recognition of the international year on the house floor in june. 3.3 big data and data science statistics2013 and the efforts of steve and jeff are doing much to enhance the visibility of our field. but what about the challenges we face on the big data/data science front? our association has been doing several things. since 2008, the asa has published the journal statistical analysis and data mining, edited by david madigan of columbia university. a major focus is on data analysis problems associated with massive and complex datasets. its audience is meant to be interdisciplinary and working in data intensive fields. articles discuss the use of statistical and machine learning, data mining, visualization, and computationally intensive methods. if it sounds like data science, it is. in the june amstat news, president elect nat schenker, bob, and i announced an asa initiative whose goal is to prepare interested members of our profession to engage with the data science community and collaborate on big data problems. there is, of course, nothing stopping us as individuals from doing this, and some of us are. but, collectively, many of us who are interested are not engaged because we lack the knowledge to do so. just as we must educate data scientists who are not statisticians about the critical importance of statistical thinking, we must be prepared to understand the new ways of thinking and skills used in data science and to integrate these with our own expertise. we have launched three projects focused on attaining that knowledge. first, we have formed a workgroup that will recommend ways we can enhance our curricula to equip our students with the skills and experience to be valued team members in data science applications. this will culminate in an event at jsm 2014 and a summary report. second, the asa will sponsor a series of meetings with leaders at the forefront of aspects of data science in which we statisticians are not substantially engaged. the goal is to develop networks that will help asa to understand the key knowledge that statisticians need and to promote statistical thinking. finally, at the 2014 conference on statistical practice and jsm 2014, asa will offer short courses on the analysis of unstructured text data. this is just a start. we hope that this initiative will encourage efforts by individuals and groups in our profession to engage further with data scientists and to bridge the disconnect. 4. the future—how we all can play a role let me now turn to my final topic—what we all can do to ensure that our discipline continues to play its fundamental role in science, business, and government and is an integral part of the data revolution. i have told you about what the asa is doing to enhance the visibility of statistics on many fronts. but “the asa” is not some all powerful entity that intervenes on all our behalf. the asa is all of us, its members. as our association, asa can provide resources and infrastructure to the volunteers and staff who spearhead and carry out its activities. but, ultimately, it is the initiative of each of us that inspires what the asa does. our field is diverse, and we all are engaged in different aspects of statistical practice. i ask you to consider what you and your colleagues at your institution, company, agency, or organization can do within your sphere of practice to raise awareness of statistics and its importance to science, to data science, and to the public, and to get involved. no matter the sector in which you work, continue to promote the value and sound practice of statistics to your collaborators and institutional, agency, and company leaders. perhaps even more forcefully, exploiting the attention our field has received. embrace the spirit of the international year locally to promote the power of statistics to the public. leverage the positive attention and partner with the local school district or science museum to host a “statistics day.” host an outstanding speaker for a public lecture. pitch stories about statistics to the local media. offer to speak at elementary and secondary schools about statistics careers and what you do. if you interact with other scientists in your work, join the aaas, and contribute to our association’s ongoing outreach efforts to fellow scientists. data science is here to stay. and, as rachel schutt, a statistician who is at the forefront of data science has told me, this is great news if it attracts more talented people to data analysis. and to statistics. rachel taught a course on data science at columbia last fall and is co author of a forthcoming book based on that experience. she cites myriad open problems that require adaptation of classical statistical methods and design principles to massive data. and for frameworks for thinking about inference in this setting. our involvement is critical, lest erroneous conclusions be made and wheels reinvented. perhaps badly or not at all. not all of us are confronting massive data challenges. many of us have enough challenges with the small and medium data we see in our work! but if you are, or if you are just interested in learning more, join our effort to engage with data scientists and promote the value of statistical thinking. i know many of you already are doing this. if you are in academia like i am, initiate discussions within your department about curriculum enhancement to prepare our students for the option to work in data science endeavors. reach out to colleagues in computer science, mathematics, and elsewhere and to businesses and research organizations with massive, complex data problems. show them why we are essential partners. insist on being part of campus data science efforts if you are not already. focus on equipping our students for the data revolution through coursework and research experiences informed by these connections. conceive events and opportunities that bridge disciplinary boundaries and bring scientists with massive data problems and statistical scientists together. we academics should reach out to industry data scientists. invite them to present case studies that enlighten our students and reveal needed research directions. attend a data science meetup and speak to the role of statistics. they are in every major city. i know all of you, your organizations, and asa chapters are a lot more creative than i am. 5. closing—call to action next year, 2014, is the 175th anniversary of the founding of our association. nothing would make me more excited than to see my successor, nat, stand at the podium delivering his own presidential address and noting how much progress we have made. further enhancing understanding of statistical thinking among the public and policy makers. and among our fellow scientists. engaging and partnering with the data science community. having them join our “big tent for statistics” because doing so adds value to their work. highlighting the value our unique skills bring to all data driven endeavors. i encourage all of us to rise to this challenge. in this international year of statistics, i hope you will join our association in demonstrating the unique power of our discipline to make a difference in our world.",289,17.4567474048443,4.9615460852329,0.270763131813677,5045,1366,15.6360898625176,10.6360898625176,45,0.738662810284067,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2013.844019"

Involvement Matters",2014-08-05,"Nathaniel Schenker","2000-2020","﻿1. dedication i would like to dedicate this address to my father, irving schenker, who passed away in may 2012, a week after i was elected to serve as asa president, and my mother, gilda schenker, who passed away in august 2014, three weeks after i delivered the address at the joint statistical meetings. i am grateful that i was able to share my joy at being elected with both of them and to share many of my experiences in office with my mother. mom and dad were role models to me in many ways, including as dedicated volunteers in their communities. the value of volunteering and involvement will be my major message in this address. 2. introduction in 2011, when i was invited to be a candidate for asa president, i had to agonize before making my decision. along with the possibility of a laborious three years in office, i had to consider that my son, joseph, would finish high school and enter college1 during my presidential year. there would be lots of college visits, critiquing admissions essays, family meetings, and more. and my employer would probably require me to serve the asa on my own time, which would mean spending many a night, weekend, and vacation hour writing columns and speeches, making committee appointments, attending meetings, and so on. oy vey! so why did i end up accepting the nomination? well, first and foremost, my wife, eve, told me to do it! moreover, how could i turn down such an honor from my professional home of over 30 years? i wanted to give back to the asa, because it had provided me with so much value during my career; and i had no doubt that my further involvement would provide me with even more value. and finally, i did the math and realized that i would be at the podium during jsm 2014, the year of the asa’s 175th anniversary!2 what a cool opportunity! so, here i am. many recent presidents have given addresses that look outward. they have emphasized increasing the visibility of our profession; reaching out to others whose work overlaps with statistical science; strengthening the asa’s role as the big tent for statistics;3 and publicizing the great impact that statistics has had on our world, as emphasized by the jsm 2014 theme, “statistics: global impact—past, present, and future.” last year, we celebrated the international year of statistics, which was all about visibility and outreach and which has now morphed into the world of statistics.4 and this month, the asa is launching a first of its kind national public relations campaign for statistics,5 entitled this is statistics.6 such outward focused activities are extremely important for maintaining the strength and relevance of our profession, and we should continue to emphasize them. in this address, however, i would like to look inward, and focus on the value that the asa provides to its members and volunteers. along the way, i would like to share some stories and comments about value, both as told by several asa members and based on my own experiences. this inward look will, in a way, be outward looking as well, because providing value is crucial to building and maintaining our role as the big tent for statistics. 3. why get involved? question: why get involved in the asa? two traditional answers are “my professor told me to” and “that’s the norm.” fine, but why else? well, there are the direct benefits7 that we receive in exchange for paying our asa dues: amstat news; access to journals; discounted registration fees for conferences and courses, and so on. such benefits are indeed compelling incentives to be involved, but i believe there is a much stronger incentive: the value found through involvement. i would like to draw a distinction between benefits and value with regards to asa membership and involvement. benefits are objective. value is subjective. benefits are virtually the same for every member. value varies from member to member, group to group, or over time. benefits are easy to list—on the asa website, for example. value is best illustrated with discussions of personal experiences. so let us hear from some asa members, who spoke to the asa’s megan murphy at the 2014 conference on statistical practice.8 in watching the video, communicating with other asa members, and thinking about my own experiences, i found that these valuable stories fall primarily into three categories. having lived in washington for a long time, i naturally tried to think of a catchy acronym for the categories, such as abc; but i could not think of what a and b might stand for. so, i settled on the next best thing: cde, for community, diversification, and education. 4. community two major aspects of community are serving the community and providing a community. 4.1 serving the community the asa is well positioned to serve the statistical community and beyond, with its 175 year history, its financial resource base, and its fine staff and organization. to quote mary foulkes, research professor of epidemiology, biostatistics, and health policy, george washington university, “the asa has been the focal point for public engagement with statistical science, as in input to changes in the u.s. census or comments on climate change analyses.” mary is exactly right, but the asa would not be nearly as successful as it is without its large and engaged membership, which is key to the strength of the association. consider a few of this year’s asa initiatives. we are updating our curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in statistical science9 and producing several articles that delve into various aspects of undergraduate statistical education. we are developing a set of guidelines—called statistics education of teachers10—to improve the preservice preparation of k 12 teachers. we are building a prototype web portal, a “statistical commons,”11 which we would like to become a one stop source of statistical material that does not appear in journals, such as government reports, teaching materials, software, and books. we are developing training in leadership for statisticians,12 including a short course presented at this jsm. we are focusing on various aspects of the role of our profession in big data and data science.13 we have presented short courses on text analytics at this year’s conference on statistical practice and jsm; and we are conducting meetings around the country with leaders in data science, to make contacts, broaden our thinking, and promote the role of our profession. finally, as i mentioned in the introduction, this month we are launching a national campaign for statistics,14 which will focus on benefits of studying statistics in college, rewards of careers in statistics, and important contributions of our profession to society. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 these initiatives, along with the asa’s other efforts in areas such as education,15 public policy, and advocacy,16 depend heavily on the engagement of its member volunteers, who provide leadership, expertise, energy, and innovative ideas. yet, even without volunteering, asa members contribute to such initiatives and efforts simply via their membership dues and donations. after all, the projects involve costs such as technical resources, supplies, and travel, not to mention the work of the asa staff. thus, your involvement in the asa, through membership, volunteering, and other donations, greatly benefits the statistical profession and the outside world. 4.2 providing a community let us move on to the second aspect of community, which has been particularly important to me during my career. the asa provides a professional, and personal, community for its members. i have needed this, as i have never been quite sure where i belong in the profession. during grad school at the university of chicago, i worked at cna insurance and the rand corporation and was involved in teaching and research at the university. then after grad school, i worked at the census bureau, and then ucla, during which i was also a consultant at the rand corporation. and now, i work at the national center for health statistics, and i am also an adjunct professor at the university of maryland. needless to say, i have moved around quite a bit and held quite a few positions. indeed, at a jsm session several years ago, my ph.d. advisor, don rubin, joked that i could not hold down a job. but through all of my geographical and career transitions—from the midwest to the west coast to the midwest to the east coast to the west coast to the east coast; and from edu to com to org to edu to gov to edu to org to gov to edu—phew!—the asa has been constantly present in my statistical life. let me mention just a few examples. when i moved from chicago to washington to work at the census bureau, i hardly knew anyone in the area. soon after my arrival, the washington statistical society, the asa’s dc area chapter, invited me to present a seminar, giving me the chance to introduce myself to several colleagues and receive words of wisdom from the discussant, fritz scheuren, who in 2005 would become asa president. when i later moved from washington to los angeles to work at ucla, i again knew hardly anyone in the area. as the “new kid in town,” i was asked to join the organizing committee for the southern california chapter workshop in applied statistics. as a member of the committee, i got to know several local statisticians. moreover, the committee appointed me as master of ceremonies at the workshop, which allowed me to introduce myself to hundreds of others. finally, when i moved back to washington to work at the national center for health statistics, guess what? there was a whole new crop of statistical professionals in town, and i hardly knew any of them. again, the asa came to the rescue! the section on government statistics asked me to be a candidate for office. the election spread my name around the world of government, and after i was elected, i got to know and work with many people from different agencies and organizations in the area. thus, my community, the asa, has provided copious colleagues and vast visibility throughout my career! but let us hear some more from others! jessica jaynes, assistant professor of statistics, university of nevada, las vegas wrote: as a graduate student at the university of california, los angeles i was involved in the southern california asa chapter. there, i was presented with numerous opportunities to network with statisticians in academia and industry. through these networking opportunities, i was introduced to other researchers, and collaborators, in my field of interest. this network also provided a great resource, and support group, for receiving valuable advice during my academic job search. additionally, the chapter provided me the opportunity for professional presentations to both academic and industrial audiences, which is different from the usual academic conference setting. i have continued to stay in contact with chapter members even after relocating. and amarjot kaur, executive director, biostatistics and research decision sciences, merck & co., wrote: as a young statistician, i emigrated from india and started my career here as a post doctoral research fellow at penn state university. i was new to the system, and asa provided me a platform for networking and sharing my research work. i still vividly recall attending my first jsm in toronto. i returned completely inspired and excited about all the new research work i heard about and all the new opportunities that were possible. for me it was enlightening, and i suddenly was much more aware of what i could do and what all was possible for me as a young statistician. i felt empowered with what i learned. it was at jsm that i first heard of a pharmaceutical company called merck and got a chance to network with them at their mixer. subsequently, i ended up joining merck research labs and have been there for the last 17 years. the obvious benefits the asa provided in my early years were a platform for learning, sharing, networking, and a sense of belonging to a community that shaped and enriched my career. 5. diversification now, for the “d” in cde—diversification. involvement in the asa provides a doorway to both diversification of career activities and exposure to diverse areas of statistics. diversifying my career activities has provided value to me in a variety of ways. one is by giving me a sense of fulfillment. i have always found my paying jobs fulfilling, but some of my most satisfying career accomplishments have been through volunteering in asa activities. one of my proudest moments was the initiation of the conference on statistical practice in 2012. a few years earlier, as an asa vice president, i had the pleasure of leading a terrific workgroup that developed the initial proposal for the conference. then i pitched the idea to the board of directors, who enthusiastically approved.17 17 another positive result of diversifying my activities has been achieving balance. every paying job i have had has been in one sector and has applied statistics to one general area. in contrast, my asa activities have given me the opportunity to think more broadly and globally about the profession, as exemplified by this year’s initiatives. as we delve deeper, let us note that diversifying professional activities is like diversifying financial investments. in finance, when one investment goes down, another one goes up. similarly, when things are not going perfectly at the office—which almost never happens, of course—i can look forward to working on one of my asa activities. here are a few stories about how others have found diversification related value through involvement in the asa. amarjot kaur, in describing her experiences on the committee on applied statisticians, wrote: last year our committee worked very hard and was successful in conducting a pilot mentoring program with seed money from an asa membership initiative. the feedback from this program was very positive and we are now moving ahead to scale up the mentoring program. this has provided me a sense of fulfilment over and above what is possible from my day to day job. i absolutely enjoy my current job, but being involved in asa activities has enriched my experience both at a professional and personal level. former asa president dick scheaffer, professor emeritus, university of florida, gainesville, wrote: one of the early leaders of asa found that i was interested in improving the teaching of statistics and got me appointed to the asa national council of teachers of mathematics joint committee, and that changed the focus of my career. the committee had some great successes over the years, beginning with a series of nsf grants to develop materials and educate teachers. it is important to note that the success of these education projects depended crucially on the fact that they came from and were supported by professional organizations. in short, i found the avenue to service began at asa, and through its connections moved out to a much broader world than i could ever have imagined. bonnie ghosh dastidar, senior statistician, the rand corporation, wrote: my primary outlet for volunteerism is the asa—it has constantly offered me opportunities to use my skill set to contribute to something bigger than my life. as i am exposed to new fields, applications and ideas through emails, advertisements and asa conferences, i find that i have potential – to grow, develop, adapt and improve. and june morita, principal lecturer, university of washington, seattle, wrote: through the asa, i have met an amazing array of people with whom i would not otherwise have had the opportunity to share perspectives. we share our perspectives on issues, methods and results in statistics, but also about our lives. over the years i feel indescribably enriched by my interactions with people from all over the world, in a wide spectrum of job situations, from so many different backgrounds. 6. education last but not least is the final letter in cde: “e” for education. involvement in the asa provides myriad educational opportunities. mary foulkes wrote: statistical education has always been a focus of the asa. statisticians have looked to the asa as a source of training in new and emerging areas, such as high dimensional data, spatial statistics, and numerous other topics. statistical education has not been limited to statisticians; the asa also is actively involved in outreach to other professions, to medical researchers, to science journalists, and even to capitol hill staffers. erick gremlich, mathematics teacher, churchill county high school, nevada, wrote: i am a high school ap stats teacher, and asa membership is invaluable to help me teach the course. through reading asa journals and magazines, i can stay current with how elements of the ap stats curriculum are being used in actual professional practice, work that into my lessons, with real examples, and in the process find new ways to teach different topics. and former asa president bob rodriguez, senior director, statistical research and development, sas institute, summarized his asa related educational experiences as follows: i recently came across a quotation by samuel johnson that reminded me of the lasting power of participating in our association for long term members like myself. dr. johnson wrote, “the two most engaging powers of an author are to make new things familiar and familiar things new.” i will never forget learning about new—and now familiar—regression techniques at an asa short course that was taught by john tukey and fred mosteller. looking back on my career, it is many presenters at asa meetings and short courses, together with authors of asa publications, who have most often introduced me to statistical methods and given me fresh ways to put into practice concepts that i first learned years earlier. i cannot imagine a better place to find and contribute those two powers than the asa. mary, erick, and bob discussed mostly traditional asa vehicles for statistical education, such as courses and publications. but there are many others. through volunteer asa activities, i have learned, or honed, a variety of professional skills, such as leadership and management, critical reading, and of course, giving speeches. one of my earliest, and most humbling, experiences in critical reading occurred in grad school, when i first served as a referee for jasa theory and methods. the submission, by a famous statistician, was quite theoretical, and i spent about a month puzzling over it. then i sent in a one page referee’s report that basically “dotted a few i’s,” “crossed a few t’s,” and gave a few other comments that were not particularly deep. the editor, steve stigler, thanked me for my report and sent me a copy of the other referee’s report, which he noted was very exceptional. exceptional indeed! the other referee had derived an extension of the main result in the submission, which the author of the submission used as the basis for an additional section. the other referee turned out to be none other than raj bahadur, a professor of mine. professor bahadur was kind enough to jointly referee the revision with me—that was a fantastic learning experience for me—and then he went on to tell professor stigler that i had done most of the work on the new referee’s report myself. that was, at best, a generous stretch of the truth. jennifer gauvin, manager, statistics, glaxosmithkline, described some leadership opportunities obtained via involvement in the asa as follows: through asa, i have had the opportunity to be a leader, taking on roles and positions that may not be readily available to me in my own company. and i have a network of contacts within asa that i could go to for advice. and jean adams, statistician, u.s. geological survey, wrote the following about having received a message seeking people to participate in the csp 2014 mentoring program: my immediate response was, “no.” why? well, to start with, i’m an introvert. so the idea of being matched to a complete stranger with whom i was supposed to have some kind of rapport made me pretty uncomfortable. plus, where would i find the time?” but she eventually decided to take the challenge. she went on to write: in february i was matched with a mentee. once i met her, my reservations about participating quickly vanished. my mentee and i hit it off right away, and her enthusiasm and eagerness were contagious. we agreed to have dinner later that week. i don’t know how we found time to eat, we had so much to say. although we were under no obligation to do so, we agreed to maintain our connection, by touching base once a month by phone. i walk away from these phone calls energized. it’s been a rewarding experience, for both of us. 7. conclusion in this address, i have suggested to you that involvement in the asa provides great value, through the elements of community, diversification, and education, and that your involvement matters. i have illustrated these points through my own experiences and those of other asa members. here are a few concluding observations from those “guest authors”: the asa has given me a “family.”—bonnie ghosh dastidar the golden reward of participation in the asa is friendships.—june morita it really is all about the people. asa provides the matrix for us members to connect, communicate, challenge, develop, and grow.—jean adams asa is important to me and is a great professional home for me.—jennifer gauvin i cannot imagine functioning professionally without an asa affiliation.—mary foulkes i am extremely grateful to my professors who suggested, no, insisted, that i join asa. it has been of value to me throughout my career. sometimes we may get bogged down with all the time we spend on volunteer activities over and above our regular jobs. but if we take a few moments to reflect on what we are getting out it, i am confident that we all will come out winners.—amarjot kaur lloyd bentsen had a famous line in a debate between u.s. vice presidential candidates prior to the 1988 election. he told his opponent, dan quayle, “. you’re no jack kennedy.”18 although bentsen’s statement certainly applies to me as well, i’d like to draw inspiration from president kennedy’s 1961 inaugural address,19 and close with the following: ask not what benefits the asa can give to us; rather ask how we can be involved in the asa. therein, we’ll find the value that our association provides! thank you, and happy anniversary! 18

2015,"110th","Morganstein, David","Male","Westat","Industry","175th","August 8–13, 2015","Seattle, WA","Statistics: Making Better Decisions","Statistics: Making Better Decisions",2015-08-11,"David Morganstein","2000-2020","i know this program is the last thing standing between you and the hottest ticket on the west coast this summer tonight’s jsm dance party. i promise to keep my remarks brief, but i need to start by telling you that it is the honor of a lifetime to serve as your president. one of the issues i will discuss today is the importance of mentorship in a statistician’s career, and some of the ways the asa is helping to promote and strengthen these relationships. before i begin, i would like to take a moment of personal privilege to thank and to dedicate this presidential address to a few of the mentors who made a difference in my own life and career. ms. ruth bauer was my math teacher from the 10th through 12th grades, but her influence extended well beyond trig or calculus. she was the type of teacher, who, for graduation, gave each of her students a copy of siddhartha, reminding us to explore the world around us, and to seek to live lives of meaning. i will always be grateful for her inspiration. joe waksberg and ed bryant, two of my mentors at westat, were both born in 1915, 100 years ago. ed was born in a log cabin in wyoming, without running water or electricity. joe was born in a town in poland. despite growing up on opposite sides of the globe, and being opposites themselves in many ways, they were both brilliant statisticians, and mentors to many of us. their lives and careers also illustrate another theme i will touch on today, that our profession is strengthened by a diversity of perspectives from around the world. thank you to the many volunteers and asa employees, who have worked so hard to make this year’s jsm a success. our organization depends on the hard work of some 2000 people who help keep it running. i will bet many of you here tonight are asa volunteers. if you are, raise your hand. everyone, please give them a round of applause! let me extend a special welcome to the jsm’s first timers. i hope this jsm is living up to, and even exceeding, your expectations. and i hope you will not only return next year, but also be inspired to take on greater roles in the association, whether at the section, chapter, or national level. most of all, i hope you will volunteer to take part in our mentorship program, which i will be talking about in a few moments. this has already been pointed out to you, but please do look for people who have that extra purple colored ribbon on their color versions of one or more of the figures in the article can be found online. badges. these are veteran jsm conference goers who have volunteered to serve as “docents” for this meeting. they are offering to be a resource for all of you, and to help guide and advise you through what can be an overwhelming experience. if there are any docents in the room, would you please raise your hand? feel free to ask these folks for any assistance or advice you might need. finally, i hope that all of you, whether it is your first or your 20th jsm, are indeed making the connections, renewing the friendships, and discovering the new methods that can help enhance your careers, your contributions, and your enthusiasm for our work as statisticians. and now, since i know you are tired of sitting, let us go for a walk. there are three big changes facing our profession. first, i will give you a snapshot of the changing faces of our field—of who we are today, and how we might work to both support and diversify our ranks. second, i will talk about some of the problems and challenges that have come with rapid change and data growth, particularly some of the challenges that have accompanied the rise of big data. finally, i will propose some ways not just to address the challenges, but to seize the opportunities created by change—most of all by communicating with the rest of the world and helping them understand what it is we do, and how, even in the age of big data, we can help our fellow scientists, business leaders, and public servants make better decisions. 2. changing faces of our profession the first stop on our journey answers the question, “why should we read amstat news, especially if we are looking for a job?” megan murphy at the asa office was able to find a copy of the ad that i spotted in 1976 in the back pages of amstat news—the ad that led to my 39 years and counting at westat (figure 1). (legal disclaimer required by asa lawyers: the asa cannot guarantee 39 years of steady employment from its job ads.) it is astounding how not just asa, but our profession has grown in the four decades since i answered that ad. as we all know, technology has enabled us to gather and process unprecedented amounts of data in never before imagined fields. decades ago, a four function calculator was considered an amazing advance. today we can wear a watch that is orders of magnitude more powerful than the original 13 ton univac. my watch tells me when i am lazy and need to walk more. now that is progress! not long ago, a biologist could only study gene expression by spotting black dots on a piece of paper or extracting a few numbers from standard curves. now, biostatisticians can sift through exabytes of data in seconds. not even the best clairvoyant could have predicted the diversity of ways we are now able to make a difference, and a living, as statisticians. from fighting deadly epidemics such as ebola to helping big city mayors fill in potholes as soon as they occur, from assembling world series winning baseball teams to mapping a u.s. presidential candidate’s path to the white house. when i joined the asa in 1972, we had just four sections. we now support 28 sections—from biometrics, established in 1938, to statistics in genomics and genetics, established just this year. let us look at the faces of the people who currently make up the asa, and by extension, the global statistical community. the demand for people who can analyze and make sense of undifferentiated data and put it to good use continues to grow dramatically. during the years 2003–2012, the numbers of masters’ degrees conferred in statistics more than doubled and the number of undergraduates who either majored or minored in our field has nearly tripled (figure 2). so, it is no surprise that college students are increasingly choosing statistics (figure 3). bachelor’s degrees in statistics have jumped 95% since 2010. with these numbers, we are the fastest growing stem field in america, edging out information technology. what should make us even more proud is the fact that our field is much closer to reaching gender parity than any other stem field. more than figure 2. number of statistics degrees granted between the years 2003 and 2012. 40% of degrees in statistics today are being earned by women (figure 4). but we cannot stop now. this is so important, because as demand for our skills continues to grow and as the problems we tackle become increasingly complex, we have got to ensure that our profession is populated with the world’s best statistical minds. the story of how the highly respected gertrude cox came to head the statistics department at north carolina state in 1940 is instructive. her then mentor had been asked by the university to recommend people who might head its newly created stats department. the mentor offered a list of five candidates—all of them men. after gertrude saw the letter and protested, he added a postscript, “of course if you would consider a woman for this position i would recommend gertrude cox of my staff.” imagine what statistics would have lost if gertrude had not insisted that she be included on the list, or if her mentor had not agreed to put forward her name, or if nc state had refused to consider her because of her gender. now imagine how many more gertrude coxes will join us and make vital contributions to our profession if we commit ourselves as teachers, colleagues, and employers to expanding diversity of all types in our profession. another source of diversity in the asa is the fact that we are increasingly an international organization. our membership represents some 96 countries around the world. the asa is stronger for our global representation. for the past decade, the majority of statistics graduate students in u.s. stat programs have come from outside the united states. you are indispensable to the success of our classrooms, labs, and workplaces. but we can do better by working to address the challenges you face working in a foreign language, in a foreign country. some foreign students i have had the pleasure of meeting on college visits expressed appreciation for the short courses that asa offers on improving communications skills. we should continue providing such extra assistance, and find new ways to support you in your efforts to adjust and excel! the asa speaks many languages. with so many native and professional languages spoken by our membership, and not just chinese or german, but also bayesian and biostatistician, survey design, and quality control, we often need a glossary of terms to understand each other. and that is why this meeting, our smaller conferences throughout the year, our journals and magazines, our website, facebook, twitter, and other social media outlets are so vital. we have got to keep communicating with each other, keep striving to stay current and informed of the rapid transformations taking place in our profession. we have got to communicate as one voice about our profession to journalists and to the public. we do not want the asa big tent to become a tower of babel. our work is never done. just as data can easily become dated, self satisfaction and complacency with our achievements can leave us on our heels. mckinsey & co. ( data) has estimated that in the coming years, analytical positions in the united states alone will exceed supply by as much as 190,000. we have got to continue to grow our profession, and to ensure that those taking on data jobs are equipped with statistical tools and approaches. we have got to strengthen our efforts to ensure that our committee memberships, and our committee chairs, reflect the diversity of our profession and our membership. we should strive to make sure those nominated and selected for awards also reflect the full range of talent and contributions made by all our members. on these graphs, you will notice that the rate of women’s award nominations and recipients is approaching a level matching their rate of membership (figure 5). it demonstrates exactly what we all know: diversity serves to strengthen our membership and our leadership; it elevates our capacity as an organization; and expands our range of expertise. when conference goers look at the page in the program showing the faces of our distinguished plenary session speakers, the page should reflect back on our membership. in amstat news, we can invite more guest columnists to write about the challenges of working in a nonnative tongue, or being a statistician figure 4. percent of statistics degrees earned by women since 2003. from a minority background, and propose innovative ways to address these challenges. finally, we have got to keep supporting and improving our this is statistics program, which reaches out to young people, especially girls and minority students, and encourages them to consider statistics as a profession where they can both do well financially and do good for society. these are some of our efforts to recruit and retain the best and the brightest. but i encourage all of you to develop and suggest new ideas and ways we can grow and diversify our ranks. now that we have seen the changing faces, let us look at the changing problems. 3. changing problems facing our profession as statisticians, we are all intimately familiar with the phenomenon that is big data. there is a growing belief out there that if there is a problem, big data will be able to fix it. in fact, big data is so “in,” there is a band named after it! however, many still ask, what is big data? no doubt we have benefited from big data’s ascendancy, especially when it comes to jobs. the growing popularity of statistics as a career is due in part to the growing excitement over the magic of big data. so to the public, big data and statistics are inextricably linked. these word clouds on big data and on statistics, created from thousands of articles in the new york times, offer insights into the public’s view of these two concepts (figure 6). perhaps the most telling difference is how big data’s words are less technical, and more related to the public sphere (figure 7). the benefits of volume may make it seem acceptable, more accessible to the average consumer. and that is not a bad thing! piquing the public’s interest in data can benefit our industry, that is, if we take advantage of it. in fact, some of the words these clouds have in common demonstrate the intersection between the two fields. growth, health, service, international, research—these are some of the many examples of where both fields intersect, and where both fields can benefit from collaboration. and yet, we have all noticed a paradox. while the general public seems to lump statistics in with big data, when it comes to the big data party, statisticians simply have not been getting invited. jeff leek, in the blog simply statistics, noted that several major public big data efforts neglected to include the voices and viewpoints of statisticians. let us let the numbers speak for themselves: how many of the participants at these events were statisticians? • white house big data partners workshop:out of 19 participants • moore foundation:out of 3 directors • original group that proposed nih bd2k:out of 18 participants • white house big data rollout:out of 4 thought leaders figure 6. word clouds on statistics and big data. snubs like these can be pretty disheartening. so how can we enjoy the feast without succumbing to the poison pill? we can do one of two things: • we can stand aside, cross our arms like rodney dangerfield and keep complaining to anyone who will listen (mostly each other), “we get. no. respect.” • or, we can choose to engage and find ways to remedy the situation, namely, by demonstrating how statistical methods and analyses are essential to making big data useful. many of us might get a little queasy, when we look at a big data set that was acquired, not by a carefully designed statistical survey or experiment, but for instance an e commerce site in the course of ordinary business. but we live in an age where if we choose not to engage, others– many of whom lack our tools and training–will most certainly step forward, sometimes reaching misleading conclusions or worse (lazer, d., kennedy, r., king, g., and vespignani, a. (2014), ‘‘the parable of google flu: traps in big data analysis,” science, 343, 1203—1205.). big data hubris is the “often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis ( against the rise of big data hubris/ ).” so even when the data are incomplete, we still need to engage! morris hansen, a former asa president, and mentor to me and many others, was a perfectionist. and yet, at both census and westat, he pinned this voltaire quote to his bulletin board: “the perfect is the enemy of the good.” to me, this is a key insight for us. neither we nor our clients can afford the ideal. whether the constraints are budgetary, or temporal, or due to the laws of physics, we simply cannot measure everything perfectly. instead of being paralyzed by the imperfections, we can acknowledge our gaps in understanding, and still move forward with the good. with apologies to george box (box, g. e. p., and draper, n. r. (1987), empirical model building and response surfaces, new york, ny: john wiley & sons, p. 424.), i offer “all data are dirty, but some are useful.” statistical analysis can extract value from less than perfect data. we can consider and weigh the complicating factors, and still use the data to make better decisions. sallie keller, a former asa president, describes big data as unstructured data. those statisticians who, like keller, are willing to use statistical tools to bring structure to unstructured data are best poised to master this new era. sallie and her multidisciplinary team at virginia tech are especially adept at melding together different kinds of data to produce an analysis that is more than the sum of its parts. recently, keller’s lab had been asked to help arlington county in northern virginia determine, among other issues, if there were “loyal customers”—911 callers who do not have real emergencies, but frequently tax the resources of ems with nonemergency calls for help in taking pills or simply to say hello to operators. the fire chief wanted to improve “situational awareness,” better understand the utilization of his units, and see if he could use social media to learn about incidents. her team aggregated unstructured data from a number of sources, starting with three years’ worth of 911 call records; then adding police, fire, and medical reports; incorporating social media and news reports; and assembled it into a map, which they call the rhythm of the city. they found that the ems did not have loyal customers per se, rather loyal communities—parts of the county, shown in darker shades, that were home to retirement communities, nursing facilities, and neighborhoods with a cluster of older residents. this information enabled the county to target these areas for community outreach and education about unnecessary ambulance calls ( with+arlington+county). by engaging with this “less than perfect, unstructured data,” sallie’s team was able to present her fire department collaborators with a useful, actionable discovery. as long as we are clear about our assumptions and the limitations of our data, our objective analysis remains an invaluable tool. those who are willing to give helpful, albeit imperfect, answers will always have a role to play. but it is up to us to communicate the usefulness of what we do. the challenging problems facing our profession are significant. but the good news is that we already have, or are, developing solutions to meet them. 4. changing our programs to face our problems over the past year, i have worked with the asa board and past presidents to develop four new initiatives. the first two are inward looking, designed to strengthen our members and our membership, while the second two are outward looking, intended to help promote the visibility and status of our profession. at the beginning of our walk, i shared how i benefitted from the guidance and inspiration of three very important mentors whom i was lucky to meet early in my career. how many of you had mentors who guided you along your way? please, raise your hands. are any of your mentors here at jsm? consider your text messages, emails, and contact lists. i suspect you will find someone in there who has mentored you in your career. here is an invitation to you. after the jsm, send them a note or give them a call and tell them about the gifts you received from them. mentoring is not new in our association. before this year, the committee on minorities in statistics organized annual mentoring activities at the jsm. the conference on women in statistics featured speed mentoring, and individuals have mentored on their own. for more than a decade, the washington statistical society annually recognizes an outstanding government mentor. my own section, the survey research methods section, has also sponsored a mentoring program. it is through this program that i met and began mentoring a new colleague a half dozen year ago. here is what she felt that experience was worth for her. subsequently, i am pleased to say, dhuly has become a very active volunteer in the wss. as you can see, the benefits of mentoring extend beyond professional development; mentoring helps to make statistics a welcoming community. let me recognize eric vance who has been the asa’s pointperson on building out our mentorship programs, working to initiate mentoring connections at the past two csps and at both last year’s and this year’s jsm. the biopharm section and the wss have also initiated mentoring activities. so far, we have had very positive feedback, from both mentors and mentees. a special 2016 issue of the statistician will be devoted to mentoring and will contain articles about experiences in and methods for mentoring. we have got to do a better job of ensuring that our newest and youngest members can get the support they need to build their careers. today, more than 1 out of 4 of our members are graduate students, a number achieved through providing discounted membership rates for student members (figure 8). but our retention is not as good as we would like it to be. only a small percentage of students maintain their membership after graduation. to support retention, the asa will launch the colleague to colleague system, connecting students and first year members with asa members willing to offer a helping hand. and while mentoring’s most obvious beneficiary is the mentee, the benefits often flow in both directions. as skip vecchia, the winner of the washington chapter’s 2015 award for mentoring, put it, “when you realize you need the people you are mentoring more than they need you, the importance of mentoring really hits home.” the time is long overdue to recognize the vital contributions outstanding mentors can make, not just in a mentee’s life, but to the overall strength of our profession. so i am proud to announce that beginning at next year’s jsm we will be acknowledging an outstanding mentor with the asa’s annual mentoring award. the winner will be selected from government, academia, or industry. i invite you to identify potential candidates and nominate them when the time comes. our next internal initiative is the docent program—the brainchild of our colleague mary kwasny. we created this program to help our less experienced conference goers get the most of our super sized conference. i thank our docents for volunteering in this inaugural year of the program. and i hope all of you will provide us feedback on how we might strengthen this program for next year’s conference. i am also excited to share with you the ways we have been working to increase public awareness and numeracy about statistics. there are two things that many of us find unsettling. first, a fundamental misunderstanding by the public of what we do. and second, the incorrect use of numbers and statistical analysis in the news. this year, we launched two initiatives, stats 101 and stats.org, to address these issues. most of us became statisticians because we know that statistics is an exciting and stimulating profession—one where curiosity and initiative intersect, and where we can make a difference in almost any industry that sparks our passion. but how many times have we been at a social event where someone asked us what we do for a living. when we replied “statistician,” we almost certainly got “the look.” you have seen this look many times! it is “the look” that says “there is no way i could ever do that for a living.” and it is “the look” that is almost always followed by stories about an incredibly boring or outrageously difficult statistics class they took in high school or college. to address this all too often negative perception of our profession and to help insure that many students’ sole encounter with statistics is a more pleasant experience, dick de veaux accepted a homework assignment: he and his committee are creating “stats 101.” it is a dynamic, up to date, set of real life case studies for use as teaching examples, a kind of life raft for instructors that we will offer to schools and universities. rather than have me talk more about these initiatives, let us hear directly from dick, eric, and mary. finally in january, we launched stats.org, a user friendly blog designed to decode some of the statistical issues behind the news of the day, and to bring a data driven perspective to the conversation. for instance, soon after football’s deflategate started making headlines, we posted a blog about how statistics could help determine whether or not the new england patriots were up to no good by under inflating the balls during that playoff game. our goal is to help journalists take a more critical eye to reports that are purportedly based on statistical analysis. through stats.org, we offer to partner with journalists to help them bring an accurate statistical perspective to the news. since we launched the blog, we have had more than 220,000 visitors! 5. conclusion during our walk today, we have seen the changing faces and problems and how we are changing our programs to address them. we are blessed to work in a profession that is in high demand, one that allows us to use our quantitative skills to solve real world problems and make a difference in the fields we care most about, whether it is climate change, education, or public health. but we cannot afford to relax. judging from the people i have had the pleasure to work with in my 40 years with asa, most of you are not planning on it. with this is statistics, we will work to recruit the next increasingly diverse generation of statisticians; with our new mentoring award, we will inspire more veteran members to help in guiding the careers of our newest members. through stats.org, we can inject statistical thinking into the fast paced news cycle that fuels public knowledge. and with stats 101, we can encourage and provide more and more talented people with the tools to incorporate proper statistical thinking into their research, decision making, and daily lives. we have many tools. but we are more than just a toolbox. we are collaborators and problem solvers: we are leaders! let us continue working together as we strive to meet the challenge gertrude cox set for us so many years ago—to embrace new statistical frontiers, and to use our skills to serve other human beings. as sharon lohr reminded us in her 2014 deming lecture ( our great value is in transferring statistical theory from one problem to another, using our special tools to make better decisions in new problems in education and health, in quality improvement, and improving the social condition. we cannot rest until our ranks are fully diverse, with women and men of all backgrounds contributing their talents, insights, and fresh perspectives to our toughest statistical challenges. and we cannot consider our job done until we have found a way to enrich the human condition, add to the public good, and make the world a better place. this is what we do. this is statistics! thank you.",246,18.7357723577236,4.67151225862443,0.301800824473855,4609,1391,14.7152154850796,9.71521548507956,59,1.53071840600532,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2015.1106790"

Statistics",2016-08-12,"Jessica Utts","2000-2020","﻿i chose this title for my presidential address with a dual meaning in mind. the most obvious meaning, of course, is that what we do as statisticians should be appreciated, perhaps even more so than it is. but the second meaning has to dowith the rapid rise of our profession in all sorts of ways. our value truly is rapidly appreciating! let’s look at some examples. the high school advanced placement statistics exam,withwhich i have been involved since the first year it was offered, was given for the 20th time this past may (figure 1). in its first year, 1997, the exam was taken by fewer than 8000 students. this year? almost two hundred and eight thousand! and that does not count the students who take the course but not the exam. 208,000! that’s a lot of potential future statisticians! our value in the job market is appreciating as well. according to the bureau of labor statistics, statistician is projected to be one of the fastest growing jobs in the united states in the next 10 years, growing 34%, when the growth rate for all occupations is projected to be 7%. that places statistician 9th out of the hundreds of occupations listed by bls (figure 2). considering only occupations requiring at least a college degree, statistician is third in the list, preceded only by nurse practitioner and physical therapist. the number of degrees awarded in statistics and biostatistics is growing rapidly as well. the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded annually has increased by more than 300% since the 1990s, and the number of master’s and phd degrees awarded from the year 2000 to the year 2014 increased by 260% and 132%, respectively (figure 3; asa 2015). yet even this amount of growth is not likely to meet the demand. again according to the bureau of labor statistics, employment for statisticians grew from about 20,000 positions in 2008 (crank 2010) to about 30,000 in 2014, but that doesn’t count many of us, such as professors or managers, who come under different occupational classifications in the bls database (u.s. dept. of labor 2015; asa 2015). and neither the current employment statistics nor the future projections include the rapidly growing numbers of other jobs that are not labeled “statistician,” but require substantial expertise in statistics. for instance, in 2014, linkedin placed “statistical analysis anddata mining” at the top of its list of 25 hottest skills in demand (murthy 2014). at the beginning of 2016 that category had fallen to number 2 overall, preceded by “cloud and distributed computing,” but as linkedin noted in the accompanying report, “data isnt [arent!] going anywhere. our top skill category last year, statistical analysis and data mining, is still sitting comfortably at #2. it is the only skill category that is consistently ranked in the top 4 across all of the countries we analyzed. we still live in an increasingly datadrivenworld, and businesses are still aggressively hiring experts in data storage, retrieval and analysis.” (murthy 2016) so our value is appreciating! but with this increased demand comes a big challenge. there are not enough of us to meet it! by now most of you probably have heard the quote from the mckinsey global institute, that “by 2018, the united states alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions.” so what to do?well, in my role as chief reader for advanced placement statistics, i know there are thousands of dedicated high school statistics teachers who would love to learn more about possible careers in statistics for their students, and hundreds of thousands of students who would benefit from hearing from a professional statistician. so, as one of my presidential initiatives, i put together a committee to formulate ideas for making that happen (figure 4). and wow did they come up with ideas! i will highlight some of their work here, and ask you to watch for more information coming soon on how you can get involved. information will be provided through amstat news, as well as the asa community forums. but first, i want to thank the committee, led by asa board member anna nevius, for their amazing work; join me in a round of applause! the major focus of this group has been to put together resources to prepare professional statisticians to visit high school classrooms. asawill be rolling out a newwebsite in the next few months, and this list of resources will be rolled out with it. some of the resources include: tips and tricks for meeting with a high school audience links to existing resources, such as the excellent videos and presentations at the website “thisisstatistics.org” resources and suggestions for making your presentation interactive information about “statistics plus”—the idea of combining statistics with whatever else interests you, including a (very long) list of collegemajors that require statistics (figure 5)! i know you can’t read this list, but that’s because they found over 140 majors! as part of this ongoing project, we hope to create methods for connecting asa members with local high school teachers. when i announced this initiative to the several hundred high school teachers who work together with college professors at the week long advanced placement statistics reading, where the exams are scored, it met with a very enthusiastic response. so i know there are teachers who are ready to host asa members who are willing to talk with their students, and i encourage you to be one of those members! i will wrap up this version of “appreciating statistics” with an anecdote. when we were interviewing job candidates for a faculty position in my department this past year, one of them told me that it was a visit to her ap statistics class by a biostatistician from md anderson cancer center that convinced her to become a statistician. so you really can make a difference by visiting a high school classroom! now that i have addressed the first aspect of “appreciating statistics,” i will address the aspect that you probably thought of first when you heard the “appreciating statistics” title of this talk. what we do should be appreciated by everyone! and yet any of us who have responded to a stranger asking the “what do you do” question during casual conversation know that the most common reaction is not “wow! i really appreciate what you statisticians do for the rest of us!” figure . bureau of labor statistics’projected fasted growing occupations. figure . number of statistics and biostatistics degrees granted between  and . in fact, a very common response seems to involve a complete misunderstanding of what we do. very few people seem to realize how what we do benefits everyone in multiple ways. let’s look at some of those ways. one of my favorite concise accounts is sas co founder john sall’s (2013) blog, celebrating the start of the international year of statistics. the blog entry was titled “why statistics is essential” and one part of it read: “most people don’t realize how essential statistics is. our daily life is surrounded by the products of statistics. you brush your teeth. the fluoride in the toothpaste was studied by scientists using statistical methods to carefully assure the safety and effectiveness of the ingredient and the proper concentration. the toothpaste was formulated through a series of designed experiments that determined the optimal formulation through statistical modeling. the toothpaste production wasmonitored by statistical process control to ensure quality and consistency, and to reduce variability. the attributes of the product were studied in consumer trials using statistical methods. the pricing, packaging and marketing were determined through studies that used statistical methods to determine the best marketing decisions. even the location of the toothpaste on the supermarket shelf was the result of statistically based studies. the advertising was monitored using statistical methods. your purchase transaction became data that was analyzed statistically. the credit card used for the purchase was scrutinized by a statistical model to make sure that it wasn’t fraudulent. so statistics is important to the whole process of not just toothpaste, but every product we consume, every service we use, every activity we choose. yet we don’t need to be aware of it, since it is just an embedded part of the process. statistics is useful everywhere you look.” indeed! so why are we not appreciated more by the general public? i think part of it has to do with our lack of visibility. and why are we not more visible? partly because, as john tukey famously noted “we get to play in everyone’s backyard!” and it’s the front yard that everyone sees! figure . members of the ap statistics career information initiative work group. i like to think of us as “the wizards behind the curtain!” to illustrate this point, a few weeks ago i did a search of articles for the previous 30 days in the new york times, i found 201 references to “economist,” 50 references to “psychologist,” 31 references to “biologist,” but only 3 references to statistician. and unfortunately, one was mentioning the statistician mother of a bride in a wedding announcement (congratulations if you are here!), one was in an article on prozac and quoted someone saying “one can question whether i’m qualified to make that judgment. i’m neither a psychiatrist nor a statistician. but as the author of a book on mental illness, …” and, finally, congratulations to asa member and fellow rafael irizarry of who actualy was quoted as an applied statistician! why are we not more visibly in the news? i think partly because, unlike economists who study issues in economics, psychologists who study issues in psychology, biologists who study issues in biology…we study all of those things! those things are newsworthy, but we are not the ones the media would naturally think about as experts, even though, often, we are! in fact asa maintains amedia experts list withmembers willing to talk with the media, covering 148 topics! why should we care that we are not more visible? partly because of the other “appreciating statistics.” as noted already, we need more of us! and one way to attract more young people to our profession is to be more visible about how important our work is to society, how many intriguing problems we get to work on, and how much we contribute to the betterment of almost every aspect of life! but that’s not the only reason i think statisticians need to be more prominent in the news andmore involved with the media. another reason is that statistical information is so oftenmisrepresented in the news, andwe are the oneswho canhelp themedia get it right. my father was in the newspaper business, so i know a little bit about how it works. for instance, i know that headlines generally are not written by the same person who writes the article. that might help explain why headlines are so often flagrantly misleading. here are some of my favorite bad headlines, with thanks to roxy peck for providing some of them: � “spanking lowers a child’s iq” (los angeles times, 9/25/09) � “joining a choir boosts immunity” (woman’s world, 6/27/16) � “6 cups a day? coffee lovers less likely to die, study finds” (nbc news website, 5/16/12) � “want to live longer? start walking—quickly” (time magazine website, 1/4/11) what’s wrong with these headlines? in all cases, the study being discussed was observational, and i’m sure all of us can think of probable confounding variables in every one of them. and in many of these cases, so could the writer. in some cases the writer quoted the researchers providing examples of confounding variables and explaining that causal claims should not be made. but many people don’t read past the headlines, and even those who do may not understand the difference between an observational study and a randomized experiment. i think our job here is two fold. first, we need to form better relationships with the media. we have made some headway in getting better representation on editorial boards of subject matter journals, so journal reports of the studies behind these headlines may do a better job of explaining the shortcomings. but we need to do much more with direct media contact. the second thing we need to do is educate citizens, starting with our students, to be better consumers of statistical information. i will address each of these two “action items” in turn. first, let’s discuss the media. those of you who attended joe palca’s talk yesterday will have heard some great ideas for how we can do a better job with our media interactions. and if you missed his talk, it will be available on the jsm website. in addition, two of my presidential initiatives are geared toward strengthening the presence of statisticians in the media. figure . members of the media training initiative work group. the first is a media training program for asa members. this program is designed to provide statisticians with the basic skills required for communicating with journalists and the public. the training will cover various media formats, including print, visual and audio, and will address topics such as how to respond to media inquiries, how to approach telephone, taped and live interviews, and how to initiate and respond to blog posts, op ed pieces, and so on. a pilot program will take place at asa headquarters in november. details will be announced in the coming months. the pilot will be followed by a more permanent resource for all asa members. thanks to asa vice president rob santos, and the work group responsible for developing this initiative (figure 6). please stand if you are here. the second media initiative is called the statistical media ambassador program. the work group for this programwas led byasacouncil of chapters representative to the board,wendy lou, and the other members are shown in figure 7. please stand if you are here. for the ambassador program, a select group of asa members who already have some background in working with the media are being trained in depth to serve as media spokespeople for asa. these “statistical media ambassadors,” will pledge to be available to work with the media on stories with statistical content, and will help developmaterials for stats.org. stats.org is the website asa currently sponsors, joint with sense about science usa, which provides in depth analysis of statistical stories in the news. we expect to have about a dozen of these ambassadors at a time, serving for terms of three years. the first statistical media ambassadors training took place two days ago here at jsm,with training provided by thealanaldacenter forcommunicating science. we can help members of the media do a better job of providing accurate information to the public. but the other part of the equation is educating the public to be better consumers of that information. let’s look at a familiar set of scenarios. for example, a cartoon published inthe new yorker depicts a somewhat slovenly average joe in a doctor’s office, smoking a cigarette figure . members of the statistical media ambassadors initiative work group. as the doctor warns him that “lifelong smokers have a one intwo chance of dying from smoking related disease,” towhich our average joe responds “it’ll never happen tome.” in the next frame joe is holding a lottery ticket and being told “the odds of winning the powerball lottery are 80 million to one,” to which he responds “this could be my lucky day!” i think helping people understand statistical studies and make better choices when probability is involved is ourmost difficult challenge. and that leads to the fourth of my presidential initiatives, which is to establish priorities for statistics education research, to help us figure out how to ensure that k – 16 students are able to develop the conceptual understanding needed to apply statistical thinking to various problem domains. we are working to obtain funding to hold a workshop this fall, to bring together representatives from the statistics education research community and complementary research communities such as science education, learning science, teacher education and computer science education. this initiative is led by asadirector of strategic initiatives and outcomes, donna lalonde. please join me in thanking the members of the work group for this initiative (figure 8). to convey the difficulty of developing statistical thinking, i would now like to spend some time discussing the work of psychologist and winner of the nobel prize in economics, daniel kahneman. if you aren’t familiar with his work, i strongly encourage you to become familiar with it, especially if you teach statistics. he has a lot to say that can help us understand why students have so much difficulty with what we teach, and why people make choices that as statisticians we may not think are rational. my favorite of kahneman’s writing is his best selling, awardwinning book, thinking, fast and slow (2011). this book is a gold mine for statisticians who are trying to understand the way people think about what we do, or perhaps more importantly, what we hope they will think about (but don’t) when they make choices based on what we do. let’s look at some of kahneman’s examples of how statistical thinking does not come naturally. the first example was suggested to him by statisticians howard wainer and harris zwerling, and here i present a somewhat abbreviated version: a study of kidney cancer in the 3,141 counties in the united states revealed a remarkable pattern. the counties with the lowest incidence are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in republican states. now you are probably busy thinking about explanations. i doubt if most of you are giving credit to the republicans, even if you are one, so you aremost likely thinking that rural areasmust be better for one’s health—better air, perhaps healthier food, and so on. figure . members of the statistics education research initiative work group. but now let me give you another result from the same study: the counties with the highest incidence of kidney cancer revealed a remarkable pattern. they are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in republican states. what’s going on here? perhaps even as trained statisticians it’s not immediately obvious. the key is not any of the rural or republican attributes of those counties, but rather, that those counties have small populations! and as we all should know, extreme proportions, both high and low, are more prevalent in small samples than in large samples. so even if long term kidney cancer rates were the same across all counties in the united states, the extremes in any given year are more likely to show up in counties with small populations. kahneman goes on to note that the following two statements mean the same thing: � large samples are more precise than small samples. � small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do. he asserts that “the first statement has a clear ring of truth, but until the second version makes intuitive sense, you have not truly understood the first.” lack of understanding of the poor performance of small samples may be partially responsible for the recent and ongoing focus on reproducibility issues in areas such as psychology and medicine. a study published just a month ago in the prestigious journal psychological science surveyed 214 research psychologists, and found that a full 89% of them overestimated the power of specific research designs with a small expected effect size, and 95% underestimated the sample size needed to obtain adequate power for detecting a small effect (bakker et al. 2016). daniel kahneman attempts to explain this poor understanding andmuchmore through his basic premise that humans have twomental systems for navigating through life, which he blandly calls “system 1” and “system 2.” system 1 is intuitive, automatic, and “fast thinking.” system 2 is controlled, logical and “slow thinking.” hence the title of his book, “thinking, fast and slow.” the fast thinking system 1 is more influential than we think, and it can often lead us astray. he devotes many chapters in his book to explaining what he calls a major puzzle: “why is it so difficult for us to think statistically? we easily think associatively, we think metaphorically, we think causally, but statistics requires thinking about many things at once, which is something that system 1 is not designed to do.” one of the foils of system 1 for those of us trying to create statistically literate consumers, according to kahneman, is that it yearns for stories with causal explanations. when given data or study results that don’t warrant such explanations, we have a tendency to invent them. that’s one reason the headlines i quoted earlier are so appealing (and appalling!). we want to explain the observed relationship, say, between walking faster and living longer in a way that makes sense to us, and the easiest way to do that is to formulate a story that tells us that walking fast is good for your health. now i know what you’re thinking. you’re thinking that you knowbetter than to leap to that conclusion, because, after all, you know you can’t make cause and effect conclusions from observational studies. but i bet i know what else at least some of you are thinking—you’re trying to come up with a different explanation! for instance perhaps you think that causation is in the reverse direction—that people who are healthier are likely to walk more, and faster. or you’re thinking about possible confounding variables, such as the fact that walking for exercise is often a social activity, and social contact has beneficial health effects. our inclination to make up stories to explain the world around us is very, very strong. and in many situations, it’s very beneficial. it fact, according to kahneman (2011), it may even impact our survival: “system 1 has been shaped by evolution to provide a continuous assessment of the main problems that an organism must solve to survive: how are things going? is everything normal? should i approach or avoid? the questions are perhaps less urgent for a human in a city environment than for a gazelle on the savannah, but we have inherited the neural mechanisms that evolved to provide ongoing assessments of threat level, and they have not been turned off.” let’s look at another example of intuition versus statistical thinking provided by kahneman and his long time collaborator, amos tversky. this one is so well publicized that you may have heard it, but bear with me for those who have not. it’s the “linda” story, and it goes like this. “linda is thirty one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. she majored in philosophy. as a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti nuclear demonstrations.” now for the question: which alternative is more probable? � linda is a bank teller. � linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. the results? by a very large majority, people choose the sec ond option. but it clearly can’t be more probable, because it represents an intersection of two features, one of which is given as the first option! the problem, as kahneman notes, is “the uncritical substitution of plausibility for probability.” here’s another example of the dominance of the story telling system 1 over the logical and rational system 2. which do you think is more probable? � a massive flood somewhere in north america next year, in which more than 1000 people drown. � an earthquake in california sometime next year, causing a flood in which more than 1000 people drown. you get the idea. people judged the second scenario to be more probable because it contains a plausible and easily understandable story line. there are numerous other examples of how people are not good at processing statistical and probabilistic information: � confusing the probability of having a disease conditional on a positive test result with the probability of a positive test result given one has the disease, which can be very different, especially for low prevalence diseases. � overestimating the risk of catastrophic and rare events that are in the news, and underestimating common risks, such as having a fear of flying but not of driving, even while texting! � overestimating the likelihood of positive outcomes and underestimating the likelihood of negative ones, as illustrated by the earlier cartoon comparing smoking to buying a lottery ticket. � embracing data that support our beliefs, and ignoring data that contradict them, called the “confirmation bias.” before moving on to what we can do about these issues, here is a summary of how the fast thinking, intuitive system 1 can interfere with sound statistical system 2 thinking. again paraphrasing kahneman, system 1 thinking: � invents causes and intentions � focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence � neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt � is biased to believe and confirm (the so called confirmation bias, in which people hear what they already believe and ignore the rest) � overweights low probabilities � frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one another so, now that we knowmost of our time is spent in the system 1 mode of thinking, and that it can be very misleading when it comes to interpreting data and probability, what canwe do about it? as statisticians, and especially addressing those of you who are statistics educators, our challenge is how to teach people to overcome the tendency to jump to unwarranted conclusions and make unwise choices, in spite of their (and our!) natural inclination to do so. so i contend that our hardest problem is not merely to get people to understand statistics and statistical thinking. but rather, our hard problem is how to overcome eons of evolutionary advantage for system 1 thinking. that system seems to have worked pretty well. but as we have seen, it does not work well for the kinds of information that can help people make better decisions in a complex, multi variable world. to help address our challenge, i offer a quote from the book concepts and controversies, authored by another of my favorite statistical thinkers, david moore. data beat anecdotes this quote is repeated in the college version of the asa’s guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education, better known by its acronym, gaise, as something we hope students will believe and understand after taking a statistics course. but i would like to question whether anyone actually lives under the guiding principle thatdata beat anecdotes. i certainly haven’t seenmuch evidence of that. even a cursory knowledge of what’s happening in politics should convince us that anecdotes often beat data, and powerfully so. i can provide amore concrete example based on the research i have done in parapsychology. parapsychology is concerned with the scientific investigation of potential skills that are commonly known as psychic abilities, such as precognition, telepathy, and so on. formany years i have workedwith researchers doing very careful work in this area, including a year i spent working on a classified project for the united states government, to see if we could use these abilities for intelligence gathering during the cold war. this 20 year project is described in the recent book the lead scientist on the project, with input from his soviet counterparts. at the end of that project i wrote a report for congress, stating what i still think is true. the data in support of precognition and possibly other related phenomena are quite strong statistically, and would be widely accepted if they pertained to something more mundane. yet, most scientists reject the possible reality of these abilities without ever looking at data! and on the other extreme, there are true believers who base their belief solely on anecdotes and personal experience. i have asked the debunkers if there is any amount of data that could convince them, and they generally have responded by saying, “probably not.” i ask them what original research they have read, and they mostly admit that they haven’t read any!now there is a definition of pseudo science—basing conclusions on belief, rather than data! when i have given talks on this topic to audiences of statisticians, i show lots of data. then i ask the audience, which would bemore convincing to you—lotsmore data, or one strong personal experience? almost without fail, the response is one strong personal experience! of course i’m giving you an extreme example, and i think people are justifiably skeptical, because most people think that these abilities contradict what we know about science. they don’t, but that’s the subject for a different talk! so, what do we really mean when we say “data beat anecdotes?” and if it’s not always true even for statisticians, how can we possibly expect to instill it in our students, or the broader public? i would like to propose a modification. instead of data beat anecdotes, how about: data plus anecdotes! or better yet, data plus stories! what do i mean by this? if you read news reports by engaging science writers, you will have noticed that they use this tactic in their stories. they start with a compelling human interest story before delving into the less interesting details of the work they are describing. this technique of combining stories and data can be very effective. whether you teach statistics, or work as a professional statistician, your work can have a greater impact if you can tell a story to accompany your data. let’s look at a few examples. suppose you are trying to teach students about what can go wrong with election polling, certainly a hot topic right now! you could give them a laundry list of why polls aren’t what they used to be—fewer landlines, caller id that keeps people from answering the phone, and so on. or, you could give them those details accompanied by an interesting example, such as the explanation provided by yougov the day after the brexit vote, in which they predicted exactly the opposite of what happened (figure 9): “we do not hide from the fact that yougov’ s final poll miscalculated the result by four points. this seems in a large part due to turnout— something that we have said all along would be crucial to the outcome of such a finely balanced race. our turnout model was based, in part, on whether respondents had voted at the last general election and a turnout level above that of general elections upset the model, particularly in the north.” here is another example. suppose i want to present the concept of expected value to my students. i can tell them this story: last october i was planning a trip for december, but i wasn’ t 100% sure i would be able to go because of some possible family obligations for the holidays. i found a hotel that was perfect for my needs, and thought i would reserve a room. but when i entered the dates to find out the cost, i was presented with two options. i could pay $85 now, with no option for a refund, or i could pay $100 on arrival, with no obligation as long as i cancelled at least 24 hours in advance. what to do? this story provides a simple illustration of the use of expected value in a real life situation, and is much more likely to get students’ attention than simply presenting the formula for expected value. i can then ask them questions, such as, if i think i only have a 50/50 chance of going, is the prepaid option a good choice? what is the minimum probability that makes it a good choice? i can then extend the discussion to issues like extended warranties, insurance, and other situations that rely on an understanding of expected value. i could go on and on, in fact i could write a whole book about using stories like this—oh wait, i did [seeing through statistics. so i encourage those of you who teach introductory statistics to a general audience to stop wasting time on things like why we use (n – 1) instead of n, or presenting formulas that don’t help with understanding, and start incorporating stories, especially ones that will help students become educated consumers of statistical information. we have important stories to tell, and for most students we have only one quarter or semester to tell them. let’s not waste that chance. as statisticians, we all have important stories to tell. no matter where you work or what you do, i encourage you to tell our stories to your employers, to your students, to a high school class, to the media, and to the public. let’s help everyone appreciate statistics! thank you! references statistical association (2015), “more students earning statistics

(jsm), the largest gathering of professionals in our field. i hope you are availing yourself of the many opportunities. i had the honor of welcoming first time attendees on sunday, and i hope some of them are here tonight. even more, i hope you attend next year. in fact, i always thought it was a good goal for statistical association (asa) to have folks attend the second jsm. that would mean we did something right and people returned. of course, i quickly discovered that to achieve that goal, you have to have them attend the first jsm. so bring along some more new colleagues next year. i remember my second jsm. it was 1993 in san francisco. back then,with smaller attendancewefit into themeeting rooms of several hotels, and there was a fair amount of activity on the streets as attendees jockeyed between hotels. i found myself in the elevator of one of the hotels with the then current asa president, stu hunter. while i had never met dr. hunter, he was nice enough to askme how i was enjoying the jsm. i responded, ever so politely and respectfully, that i found it a terrific opportunity to hear new ideas and tomeet people.well, yesterday, i was in an elevator with a very young looking attendee, and with my id as the president of the asa in full view, i asked how he was enjoying the jsm. he had never met me and responded ever so politely and respectfully, “twelve, please.” ok, i am no stu hunter. but hunters concerns resonated with me 24 years ago and still do. viewing some of hunters elementary lectures in statistics, i noticed he always introduced the topic with a real world example. for instance, when discussing the difference between means, he demonstrated with the windings of the wires in an electric motor before discussing anything statistical. he actually had themotor on the table for the demonstration. in fact, just two days ago, the asa awarded dr. hunter its mentoring award. he was selected, in part, because of the impact he has had on generations of statisticians with his real life applications of statistics. this type of involvement is crucial for today’s challenges. 2. the challenge to our profession so what is the biggest challenge to our profession today? as i tour statistical departments it appears to be the inroads made by big data, data analytics, or some similarly named subject that is capturing the attention of students, universities, and theworld as a whole. but, i regard this challenge as a terrific opportunity for us. so, lets look at this a bit further. why is big data such a challenge? well, on the face of it, big data is playing with datasets of very large sizes. this has often been expressed in words beginning with the letter v. once upon a time, there were three vs of velocity, volume, and variety. now, depending on whom you ask, there could be as many as 42 (shafer 2017). so, even the descriptions of big data are getting big. however, we define big data, there is a lot of it, coming in fast, and from many different sources. we could be complacent and suggest that we have always worked with data, so what’s new here? frommy perspective, the concern is not the velocity of data coming in, rather the velocity of analyses going out. people want results quickly, and if you do not give it to them, there is another party that will, or they will analyze it themselves. the second concern is that at the heart of data analytics is the massive study of correlations. as we well know these correlations do not imply causation, so we can have misleading conclusions. we can also run into situations like simpsons paradox and simply get the wrong answers. if these wrong answers lead to incorrect decision making, then real trouble can occur. but, carrying on like this would simply fuel those who feel that statisticians are the original naysayers of the world. we know fisher’s familiar words, “to call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.” now, we understand that fisher was making the clear suggestion that the statistician get involved early in the process. however, to the outside world we may still be regarded as the naysaying coroner. as data become cheaper and cheaper and available in greater and greater quantities, it can no longer be confined to a relative handful of statisticians to analyze it. all of these data and powerful computational tools open data analysis to many more folks, not formally (or even informally) trained in statistics. but the twin concerns of velocity out and correlation mistakes remain. there is not much value in getting the wrong answer quickly. in june, 2016, the national academy of sciences conducted a workshop called “refining the concept of scientific inference when working with big data.” a summary of the workshop included several points to which our profession should pay particular attention. for instance, they noted that decisionrelevant knowledge can be derived from big data, but it hinges on making reliable inference. furthermore, the convenience or opportunistic method of sampling can lead to problems related to lack of controls, unidentified bias, missing or irregular data, and plenty of confounding factors. they also noted one of my favorite observations from data analyses. with a paucity of data nothing seems significant. yet, with the large amounts of data, something will appear significant, possibly leading to incorrect conclusions—and this can happen to anybody (national academies of sciences, engineering, andmedicine 2017).when my son, jonathan, was considering colleges, one of the places we visited was harvard. we flew to boston one day and took the “t” to harvard. as we got out of the station, the first thing i saw was a policeman writing a parking ticket. we had some time so we walked around and came out on another street and there was a parking enforcement officer writing a parking ticket. as we left the information session waiting for a tour, i saw yet a third parking ticket being written. i looked at jonathan and said, “wow, this place gives more parking tickets than anywhere else.” then, this high school junior looked at the chief statistician of the u.s. environmental protection agency and the future president of the asa and said, “dad, are you taking a convenience sample?” jonathan graduated in 2010—from princeton. big data has had some big successes. consider sports for a moment. i wrote a presidents corner column in amstat news discussing how big data analytics have taken hold in this field. think about the remarkable changes sincemichael lewissmoneyball came out in 2004 (lewis 2004). lewis chronicled how the oakland athletics prospered by using analytics to make decisions in player acquisitions. from that beginning, all 30 major league baseball teams now have departments of full time quantitative analysts. a notable big data player is uber. some of you were part of ubers dataset coming to this conference. though it is less than 10 years old, uber provides service in 560 cities and is responsible for about 80% of the ride hailing business. by the way, i obtained this information from wikipedia and acknowledge that i have no idea how these numbers are derived. also, i recognize that wikipedia itself is a crowd sharing model, exactly like uber (wikipedia 2017). the remarkable fact about ubers market share of the ride hailing business is that it does not own cars—it owns data. in fact, wikipedia deems uber to be a technology company, not a transportation service. of course, ubers technical success is based on its ability to use the data in algorithms to connect drivers, riders, routes, and prices in an efficient manner. i am certainly aware of ubers recent management and policy shortcomings (isaac and seshagiri 2017). these are significant problems, and they are human problems, not technical ones. this should remind us that ultimately we deal with humans and we have to do it ethically, which, among other reasons, is why asa has a code of ethics (committee on professional ethics 2016). while uber has used data to create a massive business, problems arise when we extend uber data to solving the transportation woes and urban problems of big cities. it is no secret that uber has resisted calls for its data from many municipalities. uber argues that this would violate their customers privacy (brustein 2017). the cities seem to think that analyzing uber data will solve all the transportation problems. even if true, if cities established new bus routes based on uber data, this would cut intoubers competitive advantage, whichmay be amajor reason that uber will resist these data demands. reliance on uber data will not answer all of a city’s transportation concerns. people of different economic strata use transportation differently. a clear picture of a citys transportation situation must include information about private vehicles, subway, bus, taxi, and bikes. this is where the statistician comes in. we have the training to appropriately integrate varied sources of information, and from these develop data that lead to insights to address transportation concerns. 3. the best of times i return to a baseball example. i should note that with my presidential authority over ron, and my parental powers over two of my children suzanne and jonathan, they are here tonight instead of at the orioles game against kansas city. so, for the remaining (n − 3) of you who are attending this talk voluntarily, i appreciate it. duringmy formative years, items like batting average, rbi, and win/loss records were the bedrock statistics of the game. the batting average is simply the number of hits divided by the number of at bats. the guy who had the highest batting average got the hitting crown for the year. he also was typically the number three hitter in the lineup. what more was there to learn about baseball strategy? upon learning a little about statistics, it becomes apparent that the batting average has two major difficulties: the numerator and denominator. consider the numerator: the number of hits. but gosh doesnt a double, triple, or home run mean more than a single? not for calculation of the batting average. what about the denominator? if the batter gets a walk or hits a sacrifice fly, this could be a valuable contribution to the ability to win the game, but not for the calculation of the denominators at bats. today, there are many more measures of effectiveness, perhaps too many. a statistician is the person who can analyze this for the most effective use of the data. yet, many statisticians feel the analytics train has left the station without us. what should we do about that? perhaps we should start with what not to do. there are many corporations that have failed or are struggling in recent years because they did not adapt to change. i am not at all concerned about statistics going out of business; in fact, it is really the best of times for statistics. but, i do have some concern for individual statisticians. i hope we will not have a situation analogous to phil jackson and the new york knicks basketball team. in late june, jackson and the teamparted ways since jackson was not adapting to modern basketball. the “modern” part of the game involves more and more three point shots. the analytics involved here are really quite simple. by getting a basketball to go in from farther out you get three points instead of two. thats a 50% increase in your return on investment. so the younger players are trained to shoot three pointers, and the professional leagues are paying better salaries for that talent. jackson still played the old way with layups and dunks. the sad fact is that jackson was a terrific coach. his teams won 11 nba championships. just imagine, those are more championship rings than fit on two hands. we know what not to do. what should we do? the asa released a statement, “the role of statistics in data science” in october 2015 (wasserstein 2015). the asa recognized that “. for statisticians to help meet the considerable challenges faced by data scientists requires a sustained and substantial collaborative effort with researchers with expertise in data organization and in the flow and distribution of computation. statisticians must engage them, learn from them, teach them, and work with them. engagement must occur at all levels: with individuals, groups of researchers, academic departments, and the profession as a whole.” the entire statement had collaboration written all over it. in fact, the u.s. chief data scientist in the obama administration, d.j. patil, who addressed jsm 2 years ago, stressed the importance of collaboration, but urged the statistician to get a seat at the table early in the problem analysis. collaboration is absolutely crucial, and necessary, but not sufficient. we have to go the extra mile. we have to actively learn some of the methods and certainly the nomenclature of data scientists. there are some specific areas we have to learn, such as techniques for messy data and applications, such as spark (spark apache organization 2018), hadoop (the apache software foundation 2017), and tensorflow (the tensorflow organization 2018). i am a perfect illustration of this. i know nothing of these tools and i thank david banks for pointing them out to me. senior members like me are going to have to be willing to learn from our younger members. we at the asa are going that extra mile. conferences, guidelines, reports, journals, active learning experiences, short courses, and research experience for undergraduates are all sponsored or supported by asa. certainly, a glance through this week’s jsm program shows plenty of big data related topics. we have multiple asa sections with keen interests in data science. in april, we ran an amstat news article profiling several data science and analytics masters programs and their relationship to statistics (pierson 2017). a healthy blog followed with others discussing how the interrelationships have worked at their universities. but, we can do more, and the asa board spends considerable time on this topic at its meetings. the take home messages for us are to be active, to collaborate, to get to the table early, and learn some new skills. collaboration requires good communications among all parties. i have given many seminars regarding the importance and the necessity of clear, succinct communications. in fact, one of my presidential initiatives directly involves communications. people of my generation remember this famous phrase from the movie cool hand luke, “what we got here is a failure to communicate” (rosenberg 1967). we cannot afford such failures. not only do we have to get our point across, but also we have to make sure our conclusions and analyses are correctly used in decision making. 4. the importance of communication many of you have heard my mantra: “its not what we said, its not what they heard, its what they say they heard.” so, how do we assure that they are spreading our intended message? we have added support to the pioneering efforts of john bailer and richard campbell at miami university. john, who heads the statistics department, and richard, who heads the media, journalism, and film department, developed the stats + stories podcasts. these audio podcasts feature a statistician and journalist quizzing a statistician to explain the how, why, and what was done in nontechnical terms. their maxim is “the statistics behind the stories and the stories behind the statistics.” asa is providing support and funding to create a national profile for stats + stories. activities include joint editorial discussions concerning the selection of topics and presenters, increasing the production schedule, and even producing shorter, but more frequent short stats + stories. here is a brief portion from my appearance about a year ago on this podcast, to give you a flavor (stas+stories 2016). bob long: the 2016 presidential campaign has been just a little raucous to say the least. we have at least one presidential candidate has promised constituents if hes elected hell shut down the us environmental protection agency. in stark contrast, there are others who have focused attention on the potential harmful impact to children of lead in the drinking water in flint, michigan and possible missteps along the way. for whatever reason, environmental issues such as auto emissions, air and water pollution always generate controversy. and our guest today on stats and stories knows a thing or two about getting the ear of a president and having them actually listen to his advice. im bob long, we welcome to stats and stories, a program where we look at the statistics behind the stories, and the stories behind the statistics. and our discussion today is going to focus on the importance of studies about our environment. while aimed at communications, the preceding initiative is also a shout out for collaboration, supporting statisticians presenting their analyses and conclusions in a knowledgeable succinct way. when this happens the subject matter experts then realize and appreciate the statistical contribution. once again, think about that national academy of sciences workshop. one of the workshop suggestions is to build trust and strong personal relationships with subject matter collaborators so that the statisticians are viewed as constructive members of a research team. this initiative goes a long way to improve our ability to communicate and collaborate. i cannot emphasize enough that in our evolving world with more complex relationships among data elements, it is crucial that statisticians hunker down and hone their collaborative abilities and communication skills. our forte has always been in the interpretation, impact, appropriateness, and quality of data. this should remain the case. it becomes increasingly imperative that we work with others, understand the underlying processes, and explain the results and conclusions concisely. 5. more initiatives while on initiatives, i have two other presidential initiatives that, while useful in their own right, also support the role of the statistician in addressing big data issues. i hope you will agree. in the list of 42 vs of big data, we find the word voyage. the idea is that we must always keep learning. with an eye toward learning, and to entice young people into statistics, we have started an initiative, the house of statistics. aimed at the middle school level, the house of statistics will be a virtual home for educational videos, career exploration, competitions things that reflect to middle schoolers that statistics is cool. the third initiative involves engaging the fastest growing segment of the statistical community: the asian statistician. there are many asian statisticians at the jsm and other meetings, but not proportionately at some of the inner workings of our society such as the sections, chapters, and committees. we are collaborating with the international chinese statistical association, the international indian statistical association, and the korean international statistical society to address the needs of asian students and young professionals.we are especially interested in understanding the differences in culture and customs thatmight affect their decision to get involved in society activities. this has already resulted in an extra session at this jsm concerning career development geared to young asian statisticians. i should add that it was held sunday morning, and we were quite concerned about possible low attendance. it turned out we even had to add extra chairs to meet the overflow audience. it should come as no surprise that involvement of this group will also assist in cracking the secrets of big data. a word in general about these initiatives. i do not want these to bebarrys initiatives. they areasa initiatives, and indeed they are activities that should be undertaken by asa long after my term concludes. i certainly hope you will agree with me. putting together an active collaborative role toward big data, with some positive effects from these initiatives, and improved communications skills, we will meet the current challenges. indeed for those who lament that the good old days were great and it was the best of times, i claim in fact it is still the best of times. 6. aword of thanks one of the reasons asa presidents can offer initiatives and push the profession is the terrific support we receive from the professional staff of asa. yes, it is clear that someone is minding the store, and doing an excellent job of it. running a jsm with thousands of attendees is not an easy task. but, the work of the staff extends beyond the jsm to many other activities such as coordinating chapters, handling finances, distributing communications and publications, maintaining an active policy voice, continuing education, developing innovative programs, and maintaining an online presence. so, there is a lot behind the scenes and sometimes that is only visible when you are an officer and see how it all works, and even then i am certain i am missing quite a bit. we owe much gratitude to ronwasserstein and his entire staff. please join me in thanking them. speaking of applause, i applaud your activities. with the set of initiatives and some of the thoughts on big data i have expressed tonight, this is still the best of times for statisticians. one of the opportunities i have most enjoyed as the president was responding to a high school student who wrote to asa as part of his career research to ask what a statistician does. it was with true pride that i could answer the students questions and relate that statistics is truly a fulfilling profession. when you really believe you are in the right place, it is a joy to share it with others. the q&a was printed in the february amstat news. incidentally, while it was greek to me, it was even translated for the greek statistical institute newsletter. 7. conclusion the present state of statistics is bright; the future is even brighter. with our collective abilities to analyze, explain, and interpret data, we are in the drivers seat. it is not the party with the data; it is the party who can interpret the data that holds the trump card. one of my favorite examples harkens back to the days when lead was in gasoline. i was the branch chief of the group establishing regulations to decrease the amount of lead usage. in all my seminars on statistical communications, i show a simple graph showing the relationship between the lead levels in childrens blood and the elemental amount of lead in leaded gasoline. this simple but very illustrative and concise graphmade it to the president of the united states and became a major element in the progress toward eliminating lead. i should explain that this graph shows blood lead levels of black and hispanic children compared with the amount of elemental lead in gasoline. you can see the strong correlation. naturally, the first thing president carter did was to say “get me nussbaum, correlation does not imply causation.” ok, ok, he did not do that but i like to dream. let us make sure our messages get out there in a similar, clear, useful, succinct manner. oh, humor helps as well. now typically, when a speech ends, the speaker simply says thank you and you all applaud because you are delighted he or she is finished. certainly, the honorees who are about to be named fellows are eager for me to step aside. however, tonight, i will say “thank you” three times. the first one is the pro forma thank you that signals the end. the second “thank you” is my sincere appreciation to you for the honor of being your president and the opportunity to express some views how to ensure that our profession continues to be the vibrant, fun, interesting, rewarding, and satisfying profession that it is. but, the third one is a very personal appreciation. i have always stressed that our work should have a positive impact on the society. you may have noticed i have not used the word impact in my talk until now. that is because i have come to realize that the true impact of our profession is often implied, and not overt. two years ago, i lost my wife after an incredible 26 year battle with breast cancer. the fact that she survived so many years is a testament not only to modern medicine and dedicated oncologists, but also to you people. the statisticians are the ones developing the clinical trials responsible for the success claimed by the medical profession. you, and you, and you are the unheralded heroes of this success. my family and i have received this wonderful impact of your work. and, that is why my last thank you is a very personal heartfelt one. thank you. thank you. thank you.",260,16.0269230769231,4.84353251739861,0.322054235661147,4167,1342,14.5427654187665,9.5427654187665,79,1.89124737738801,"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2018.1463486"

now, fast forward to 2018 — it appears that dennis had a tremendous amount of insight 18 years ago. you could take his speech and replay it today, substituting data scientists for information scientists. the data science story is not new. asa has been talking about 2 this for several years, and the board has grappled with different initiatives, even considering asa accreditation. wherever we work, academia, government, or industry, data science will or is already affecting our jobs. academic departments, including the one i am in now, are positioning themselves to make their current degree programs relevant for the myriad of data science positions in the marketplace. government agencies are as well. at the federal drug administration (fda), for example, there is a push under the 21st century cures act to increase the agency's expertise in data science. there is a leadership opportunity regarding data science in every employment sector, and we should not let it pass us by. we should choose to lead. this is the title of my talk — choose to lead — and i want to set up a cheer that we can repeat a few more times this evening. okay, are you ready? here goes the cheer. when i say “choose,” you say, “to lead!”. got it? okay, let's practice. choose (pause) to lead! choose (pause) to lead!: choose (pause) to lead! whoop whoop (with hand cheer). 3. why leadership? those of you who know me or have heard me speak over the past few years know that leadership is important to me. why is this so? early in my career, i was drawn to statisticians who could influence a crowd, move a meeting to a decision, and have an impact on things that mattered. these were the statisticians i wanted to emulate, and i chose my mentors accordingly. i recognized immediately that there was a lot to learn, and i was pretty sure that learning leadership was not just possible, but essential. i did not buy into the notion that there are born leaders, and then there are the rest of us! but i was equally sure that i would have to go out of my way to make this learning happen. it was not going to present itself through a usual course of study. through good fortune, i've been able to work with some spectacular statistical leaders during my career, and i credit any success met along the 3 way with their tutelage. now being of a certain age, my focus has shifted to sharing stories, experiences, and knowledge learned with the next generation or two, in hopes that i can help others by modeling the leadership behaviors that were so beneficial to me. now i'd like to take you on a leadership journey. i will share a few leadership stories from my early, mid , and late career, traveling through the private sector, to academia, and to the government. this journey will lead us to some present day highlights of asa initiatives, concluding of course with the leadership institute. 4. early career (rti) my first job out of my master's was as a mathematician at the research triangle institute (rti), a not for profit organization with a very strong reputation in statistics, having its statistics department founded by none other than gertude cox. daniel horvitz was the vice president at the time, and after working for him on a large survey of medical care expenditures, he advised me to go back and get my phd. he was not a person you said no to, so i returned to my undergraduate institution, university of north carolina at chapel hill (unc). he also told me to look up this young fellow named gary koch in biostatistics. anyone heard of him? gary eventually co chaired my dissertation and assumed the role of life time mentor for me and eventually for both of my daughters! what i owe to both of those early mentors is immeasurable. rti gave me a solid foundation in and appreciation for probability sampling and complex survey data analysis. working with such notables as babu shah, jim chromy, ralph folsom, and many others was truly inspiring. what a start to a career! rti also gave me my first taste of impacting policy with statistics. at the end of a multi year survey of vietnam veterans to study the prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), i joined the project team and was responsible for estimating ptsd prevalence using a self report measure from the 4 survey data supplemented by a clinical diagnosis on a subsample. working with gary koch as consultant, we developed a model that combined the data from these two sources, accounting for survey non response and for the fact that the clinical subsample was not random but rather geographically convenient. we generated model based estimates of ptsd prevalence that were unbiased and accurate, and simulated standard errors of the estimates to reflect the many sources of variation in our estimation process. the end result was an estimate of ptsd prevalence averaging 15% across all vietnam veterans, and even higher for those who served in high combat zones. the estimate in use at the time was 2%, and the difference received a lot of attention because of its impact on health care provided by the veterans administration (richard a. kulka and william e. schlenger, john a. fairbank, richard l. hough, b. kathleen jordan, charles r. marmar, daniel s. weiss, 1990) and (lavange and koch, 2007). congressional hearings were held to review the final study report, and the results were featured in the august 29, 1988 issue of newsweek magazine. i remember calling my father when the article appeared. as a self made business man in nashville, tn, he liked to joke that he never really understood what a biostatistician did but was pretty sure we did not actually produce anything! i pointed to the newsweek article and said, “i produced that 15% — that's my number!” statisticians can make a difference (gelman, 1988). choose (pause) to lead! 5 5. mid career (pharma) after 16 years at rti, which included my first stint as a manager of a group of statisticians and programmers, i made a move to the pharmaceutical sector. having worked on a few clinical trials towards the end of my rti tenure, i decided to dive into industry and learn more about drug development. i joined quintiles and rose to a senior position as vice president of biostatistics in north america, directing statistical and stat programming activities in five offices across the us and canada. it was at quintiles that i received significant training in management and, more im portantly, leadership. the company knew the value of investing in their employees, and how important that investment would be during periods of rapid growth. there were 6,000 quintiles employees when i joined, and 20,000 when i left, largely through acquisition of other companies. anyone having to manage through an acquisition knows the importance of 6 having strong leaders with clear vision and a strategic plan. dennis gillings was one of the most inspirational leaders with whom i've had the opportunity to work. his ability to look into the future and figure out where the industry was headed, and then take the steps to get there first, was truly amazing to witness. one example was his foresight to build a global cro with offices across europe, asia, australia, and africa early on, long before the value of global drug development was as universally recognized as it is today. my experience at quintiles gave me an appreciation of the value of leadership training and of having a strong statistical leader as role model to learn from. it was also at this time that i connected with so many brilliant statisticians working in the pharmaceutical industry and gained a better appreciation of the important research they conducted. christy chuang stein and steve ruberg come to mind, among many others, and they remain good friends and colleagues today. my mid career leadership story i'd like to share comes from a different setting. after sev eral years of working on late stage drug development, fda submissions, and post marketing trials, i wanted to learn more about the front end, about where drugs come from and how one decides what molecules to develop. an opportunity arose to join a small pharma company with just a few products in development and a staff of about 35. i joined inspire pharmaceu ticals in 2001 as vice president of statistics and data management and set about building a group to manage those functions. more importantly, i earned a seat at the grown ups' table. i was a member of the executive leadership team and invited to help strategize about the company's direction. our ceo was a scientist with a doctoral degree in pharmacology, and, she was a woman! who knew?! our board chair was leigh thompson, the man who brought you prozac. what an opportunity to learn from one of the great minds in pharma ceutical development. leigh was responsible for sending me to palo alto to get trained in decision analytics, with the responsibility of bringing those skills home to help the company manage its portfolio with more than just gut instincts. i was introduced to a whole new 7 aspect of leadership training. you've heard the adage about leaders and decisions — any decision is better than no decision? now i had a new appreciation of just how important making decisions as a leader really was. and what a surprise to learn that decision theoretics is really just bayesian probabilities applied to solve cost benefit puzzles in business practice. why don't we see this training in more statistics departments? more on that later. it was during my time at this small company that an opportunity fell into place. after working hard on the design of a phase 2 trial in a rare disease that would result in a go/no go decision about a drug, strong positive results came in, and i found myself at a scientific meeting responsible for presenting those results(robin r.detering and ramsey, 2007). some at the company had not given the trial much of a chance for success, but we designed several safeguards into the study to minimize variability and optimize the likelihood of detecting a signal, pushing the clinical staff along the way to try something new. and the careful design and attention to quality paid off. our ceo, christy shaffer, was at the meeting, saw my presentation, appreciated my understanding of not just the statistical aspects of the trial but the drug's mechanism of action, safety considerations, and so forth. as soon as i stepped off the podium, she asked me to lead the entire development program. this was well beyond the typical role for a statistician in industry at that time, and i jumped at the chance. before i knew it, i was in japan negotiating the price of our drug substance with a chemical company, interacting with the fda on requirements for toxicology and carcinogenicity studies, and talking to the marketing folks, all while designing the first phase 3 trial. i left the company after launching that trial, which was also successful, and i took with me a new knowledge of the possibilities for statistical leadership as well as gratitude to another wonderful role model for the opportunity she provided. choose (pause) to lead! 8 6. late career (academia and government) after a 10 year run in the pharmaceutical industry, with all the excitement of working to cure diseases and positively impacting public health, i decided to try a different employment sector—academia. and not just any old institution, but my beloved alma mater, unc! back to history for a minute. as a female getting a bachelor's and master's in mathematics in the early 1970s, i was definitely in the minority. in my doctoral program later in that decade, the students were more evenly balanced, but not the faculty. there were so few female faculty members, i remember thinking it must be impossible to get tenure and raise a family at the same time. i went to the private sector after graduation and never looked back. then, all these years later, an opportunity arose to return to academia as a professor of the practice, a new position at unc created for the business school to attract faculty with practical experience from industry. thanks to ed davis, then chair of biostatistics, the school of public health beat the business school in being the first to hire in this track, and i was the fortunate recipient. in addition to teaching courses on statistical consulting and clinical trials with a focus on practical experience, and developing our first course on statistical leadership, ed recruited me to direct the collaborative studies coordinating center the oldest, continuously funded nih coordinating center in existence, being founded in 1971 as the lipids research center. i loved being an academic at this point in my career but was not at all sure that my management and leadership expertise from the private sector would apply. not surprisingly, that concern was soon put to rest. as soon as i walked in the door, i was asked to lead a proposal for the hispanic com munity health study/study of lations (hchs/sol). funded by the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi), this study was the largest study of hispanics living in the us conducted to date. it was patterned after the atherosclerosis risk in communities or aric 9 study, already 20 years running at that time (2006). our job was to design a prospective lon gitudinal cohort study of 16,000 hispanics and latinos recruited at four field centers across the us with sufficient representation of cubans, mexicans, puerto ricans, and central and south s to support comparative analyses among hispanic backgrounds of risk fac tors and their relationship to disease incidence. no non hispanics were to be recruited, and the national health and nutrition examination study (nhanes) was to provide the non hispanic comparator group, so our design needed to match up to the nhanes as much as possible. we designed a two stage probability sample of households that incorporated over sampling of census blocks with high proportions of hispanic households at the first stage, and over sampling of older adults at the second, to ensure adequate power to detect decrease incidence(lisa m. lavange and elder, 2010). all four field centers had brought their own study designs to the table, most relying on community based convenience sampling with which each center had experience. we faced a lot of doubt about the ability to recruit with a probability sample design, something that seemed akin to cold calling in sales, but after three years of terrific work on the part of the field centers, the cohort was formed and clinic exams began. there have been over 200 papers published from the baseline and follow up data, as well as numerous ancillary studies formed for this very valuable cohort, and a 3rd clinic visit is in the works. this is but one example that illustrates the importance of effec tive leadership in collaborative academic research. statisticians typically have one voice at a table full of clinicians and other subject matter scientists on these complex studies, but it is an important voice, and being outnumbered puts our leadership skills front and center to ensure the best possible study is conducted. choose (pause) to lead! after six years at unc, an opportunity came my way to lead the biostatistics discipline in the center for drug evaluation and research (cder) at fda, a job vacated when bob o'neill decided to step down after 40 years on the job. bob left behind a tremendous legacy in defining the role statistics plays in drug development and regulation. he seemed larger 10 than life to me, so thinking about joining fda caused me no small amount of trepidation. on the other hand, i remember many times during my 10 year stint in the pharmaceutical sector when i would be incredibly frustrated with the fda and what i viewed as poor practice of statistics by non statistical reviewers having, in my opinion, no business practicing statistics. so, here was a chance to put my money where my mouth was —stop complaining, join the fda, and make everything right. of course, i was there for about 5 minutes before i realized how incredibly naive that was! as director of the office of biostatistics, i led a group of talented statistical reviewers. together, we were responsible for all drugs and therapeutic biologics regulated by the fda. i had a teacher extraordinaire in my deputy, ed nevius, whose knowledge of all things fda was truly astounding. we were 165 strong when i joined, and grew to 215 in the next six years. statistical reviewers advise pharmaceutical sponsors on study designs and trial protocols, focusing on designs that are capable of providing substantial evidence that a drug works and is safe, evidence that could support a decision to approve the drug. once trials are completed, statistical reviewers comb through the datasets and analyses submitted by the sponsor to confirm data accuracy and validity of findings, and to make sure no signals about safety or effectiveness are missed. in their spare time, statistical reviewers conduct research and publish papers. they give talks about data standards and statistical policies. it's a busy place. i soon realized how important each and every statistical reviewer was in advocating for good statistical practice, and what an uphill battle they faced at times trying to influence approval outcomes(lavange, 2013). consider that statistical reviewers operate at about a 1 in 6 ratio to clinical review staff, and they are matched evenly with pharmacology reviewers. although the disciplines differ, you can imagine that all reviews tend to contain some form of data analysis. so what happens when results differ, or the interpretation of those results leads to different conclusions? the statistical reviewer has to have a strong voice to carry their point. consider a couple of examples: 11 • a review presented at an advisory committee meeting to support contra indication of a drug in low weight patients. at lower weights, the drug was thought to be ineffective. and the analysis presented to support this conjecture? a table of p values for tests of treatment effects in declining weight categories. the first category to show p<0.05 wins, implying that's where the drug no longer works. say what? • a clinical review of a trial where a test drug was added on to background therapy corresponding to the standard of care at the recruitment clinic. patient outcomes varied by background therapy, with one therapy looking pretty dismal, leading to an interpretation of some that the test drug should not be approved for use with that therapy. but, the test drug was significantly better than background therapy alone, regardless of which standard therapy was used. how can a non randomized comparison of background therapies, possibly reflecting variations in clinical practice or patients' illness severity, trump the randomized comparison of the test drug vs no add on, and its unambiguous interpretation? statisticians to the rescue, please! just as there are powerful incentives to see what you want when developing a drug, be it a commercial interest or a strong desire to help patients and cure diseases, there can be equally strong forces at play when reviewing a drug. thank fully, the center director, janet woodcock, one of my primary role models while at fda, continually emphasized that the agency's mission was two fold, to protect the public from unsafe medicines, and to promote the approval of safe and effective medicines. in the end, approval decisions are based on complex risk benefit decisions, and i ask you, who better to evaluate the strength of evidence, to weigh risks against benefits, than a statistician trained to be objective, to avoid bias and maximize precision, and to think quantitatively and not subjectively when making decisions that affect so many? choose (pause) to lead! while at fda, i was witness to, and part of, so many positive actions taken by the office 12 of biostatistics. clarifying statistical policies so that our review standards would be clear and the analyses we conducted as reviewers were transparent was a critical office objective. no good is served if sponsors are in the dark about what the fda expects when they design their studies. patients are too valuable a resource to be wasted on trials that have no chance of being acceptable to reviewers. two examples come to mind as illustration. the first concerns missing data and sensitivity analysis. under the leadership of my good friend and colleague, thomas (tom) permutt, associate director in the office of biostatistics, statisticians at fda have worked hard to clarify the agency's expectations about missing data in drug trials, beginning in 2010 following release of the national academies report on the topic(lavange and permutt, 2016) and (thomas permutt and chakravarty, 2016). tom, frank bretz, rob hemmings, estelle russek cohen, and others on the international council for harmonisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use (ich) e9 (r1) working group have elevated the missing data conversation to where sponsors and reviewers alike are now engaging in serious discussions about estimands – how the treatment effect is defined – and how intercurrent events, such as drop outs for adverse reactions or the introduction of rescue medications, should be handled in a trial's analysis (international council for harmonisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use, 2017). as a second example, fda statisticians have played a major role in supporting collab orative efforts to study multiple therapies, multiple diseases, or both under a single master protocol in order to take advantage of shared infrastructure and innovative design possi bilities. fda statisticians, under the leadership of rajeshwari sridhara for oncology and hematology, dionne price for anti virals and anti infectives, and james hung for neurology, have worked closely with other stakeholders on optimizing trial designs for master protocols, and the agency is actively encouraging sponsors to bring their products to these partnerships for investigation. quoting dr. woodcock, in this era of precision medicine, collaborative ef 13 forts such as master protocols are the only way forward (woodcock and lavange, 2017). and quoting me, that way forward gets a lot more obtainable with strong statistical leadership. choose (pause) to lead! there are many other areas of statistical research and policy setting where fda statis ticians are choosing to lead in important ways and having powerful impact as a result. in a paper appearing in the asa journal, statistics in biopharmaceutical research (lavange, 2019), i reflect on my time at fda and give more examples of notable contributions from my staff. aloka chakravarty and sue jane wang's leadership on biomarkers and aloka's leadership on multiregional clinical trials are examples, as are mark levenson's leadership on research related to the opioid epidemic, yi tsong's leadership on biosimilar products, stella grosser's leadership on generic drugs, laura lee johnson's leadership on rare diseases and patient reported outcomes, and mark rothmann's leadership on bayesian methods for pediatric trials. the list goes on and on! in short, fda is a fascinating organization, and i consider myself fortunate for having the opportunity to lead the biostatistics discipline there for an exciting and fast moving six years. if you want to have an impact on the practice of medicine, on public health throughout the world, consider a job at the fda. seriously. i am back at unc now, and my number one priority is to share as much of what i've learned with students as possible. i have the privilege of working with one of the most inspiring deans of schools of public health imaginable, barbara rimer, and am so happy to be working with my favorite chair again, michael kosorok—someone who manages to pull off contributions in theoretical research, real world applications, and academic leadership all at the same time, and with much grace. 14 7. asa initiatives my career journey lands me at the helm of asa for this one year, and now i'd like to brag about my association. let's start with the asa initiatives. when asa issued its p value statement(wasserstein and lazar, 2016), under the leadership of ron wasserstein, i was proud to be a member of an organization putting forth such a sensible and clear document that had the potential to impact science in a broad way. but, i was also feeling a little smug. as a pharmaceutical statistician, and as a drug reviewer at fda, we could count on pre specificity of hypotheses and of analyses, at least the primary ones, to avoid many of the problems this document sets out to address. we rely on carefully curated methods to control for bias and multiplicity; we require statistical analysis plans that could not be modified after looking at the results and seeing something that might work better. so, while a good read, maybe that asa p value statement was not so important to us. right? wrong! just look back at the examples i gave, and you can see the pharmaceutical industry and those who regulate it are not immune to the mis understanding or even mis use of p values, just like most everyone else. the p value statement is but one of so many initiatives the asa undertakes as it goes about its mission to promote the practice and the profession of statistics. there are plenty of forces out there in the world today seeking to undermine our good work, or at least under value it, so we are lucky to have an association that has our backs! the count on statistics initiative is a great example. many of our members are responsible for official statistics through their positions at the various federal statistical agencies, and these statistics pro vide the basis for policy setting at the national and local levels. a tremendous amount of effort goes into collecting and analyzing the data needed to generate official statistics, and that effort would be all for naught, if confidence in those statistics faltered. the count on statistics campaign seeks to support the federal agencies by promoting the public's confi 15 dence in their work. asa's support of good statistical practice goes well beyond this one initiative. through the tireless efforts of steve pierson and others in the asa office, we have issued statements of support in 2018 for the puerto rican institute of statistics, the independence of which was threatened this year. we supported andreas georgiou, the statistician in greece who has been unfairly maligned for carrying out his official duties in estimating the national debt, when his numbers looked too bleak. we spoke out against the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 us census, when it was clear the time and resources to make such a change at the 11th hour were not available, and the potential for such a question to negatively impact the response rate of both citizens and residents needed to be seriously addressed. you might ask whether a professional organization such as ours should get involved in what some may view as political and not scientific matters. in my view, the asa is supporting all statisticians by promoting our work and advocating for the ethical and appropriate practice of statistics everywhere. these are not partisan statements–they do not depend on who or what political party is in office. rather, they call out poor practice for the single purpose of supporting you and me. i am proud of what the asa does. i am proud that we choose not to stand by when we see statistics being threatened or undermined in any way. it takes conviction and courage to lead when it is not comfortable to do so. choose (pause) to lead! at the asa board meeting last november, we voted to form a task force on sexual harassment with the charge of determining whether our existing policy on conduct at asa events was sufficient, given the troubles being reported for other professions almost daily. then, in december, a blog was posted that sent shock waves through our profession. ques tions and concerns were immediately raised about whether we were doing enough to ensure our members felt safe (pause) and were safe at asa events. the group of women and men constituting the task force, chaired by leslie mcclure, has been working diligently to review current policies and propose new ones, and for their work, i thank them. this is a topic 16 that conjures up lots of not so pleasant memories for me, and i suspect, for many others like me, who began their careers in the 1960s or 1970s, when being treated as a professional, if you were a woman, was not a given. it is discouraging that all these years later, we are still facing this problem. i remain hopeful that instances of bad behavior affecting our profession are few and far between, are discovered early, and are dealt with appropriately. but what is much more important is the need to guarantee none of us is treated disrespectfully or feels threatened, (pause) ever. i cannot control what happens everywhere, but i speak for the asa board in stating that we will do everything possible to make asa events not just safe but positive and rewarding for all of our members. both my sons in law are proud fathers of daughters, my grand daughters, and like to say, when talking about their dreams for their girls, that the future is female. whether that is true or not, asa certainly seems poised for such a future. we have had three very successful women in statistics and data science conferences, and the october meeting in cincinnati looks like another, with its array of talks from very impressive women. remember the jsm 2000 slide from the beginning of my talk, with the fairly homogeneous slate of featured speak ers? well, compare that to today— we've added a little diversity in 18 years! in 2018, 10 of the 16 board members are women, and on january 1, 2019, all three presidents, past, present, 17 and future, will be as well. our past is rich with the contributions of female statisticians, and if i have anything to say about the future, it will be full of confident female statistical leaders! 8. leadership institute when faced with the need as asa president elect to develop initiatives that could be carried out during my presidential year, ron advised me to choose something i was passionate about, lest i tire of speaking on the topic! it seemed natural to turn to leadership, so i did. asa has had a leadership initiative for several years now, with an ad hoc committee in place and a very successful jsm workshop on leadership running since 2014. so, what exactly am i hoping to accomplish? nothing short of establishing the asa leadership institute, offering innovative programs tailored to meet the needs of statisticians who want to take their leadership skills to the next level. we convened a steering committee in the 2nd half of 2017 consisting of superb leaders 18 in their respective fields in industry, academia, and government, and based on their advice, are launching programs at three critical points in a statistician's career. at the pre career stage, as statisticians are winding up their graduate training and embarking on new careers, our goal is to raise awareness of leadership opportunities and the need to seek training in preparation for them. so, launched just a couple of months ago is our student leadership challenge! teams of students are paired with coaches, drawn from senior asa leaders, and together they will work on a challenge problem. this year, that problem involves ideas for increasing asa's membership among new professionals, and our coaches are anna nevius, barry nussbaum, wendy lou, bill sollecito, and lisa lupinacci. thank you for volunteering! the coaches will also share pointers and career stories with the student teams through a series of webinars. at the mid career stage, as statisticians are just beginning to take on management or leadership roles or are hoping to soon, our goal is to offer focused training modules that go beyond what one might learn in a traditional management training program. we are pilot testing a year long program as follow up to the jsm leadership course this year. several training opportunities will be offered to a cohort of workshop graduates, both in person and online. topics include cultural diversity and its impact on leadership, communicating statistical information with the c suite (or leading with executive presence), and decision making with analytics. gary sullivan, william wang, karen price, and laura meyerson are devoting considerable time to our pilot year, for which i am so grateful. at the late career stage, we are focusing on experienced statistical leaders who want to take the next step, reaching the upper echelons of their respective employment sectors — academic deans, bureau chiefs and agency directors, chief executive officers. our plans feature a c suite roundtable we hope to convene later this year, in partnership with the business and higher education forum. our goal is to learn about leadership train ing models by engaging leaders at these very high levels, what they see as their needs 19 in statistics and data science, and increase their interest in how asa might be able to partner with them on leadership training. stay tuned for more to come on this endeavor. now, if i needed some sort of sign to let me know i was on the right track with this lead ership initiative, i got one when i was least expecting it. my husband and i are avid tar heel basketball fans, both being unc alums who have lived in chapel hill for many decades and watched a lot of basketball. my staff at fda had to put up with my unc basketball chatter for six years, when i was too far from home to see many games. this past winter, i was at tending a game in the dean smith center, when an image came across the jumbotron touting the players who had the best stats for that game. it's a sign! surely this initiative was meant 20 to be! if we are successful in launching the leadership institute, it could become the home for professional development opportunities across a broad array of topics. my second presidential initiative on expert witness training is one such example. our goal with this initiative is to provide training and mentoring for practicing statisticians who are asked to serve as expert witnesses. the courts abound with topics requiring statistical expertise, from liability cases to political gerrymandering and beyond. and everyone knows how difficult it can be 21 to establish yourself as an expert able to withstand an aggressive cross examination. of course, our training may not win you an oscar like marisa tomei in my cousin vinny, but you should be better prepared for having taken it! we are fortunate to have several asa members with extensive experience in this area who are serving on the committee overseeing development of training modules, and kathy ensor is serving as chair. the training course under development is one to watch for! let me pause here and just remark that these presidential initiatives don't just happen because of us presidents. there is a wonderful cadre of hard working asa staff members behind the scenes making our big ideas a reality. ron wasserstein and donna lalonde conference call with me almost every single week (i counted over 50 such calls to date) to help focus ideas, come up with concrete action plans, and occasionally throw cold water on my wilder notions. and there are another 35 staff members behind them making magic happen. applause all around for the best staff a professional association could have! 9. closing this brings me to my closing. but if you would indulge me, id first like to embarrass my daughter who was able to be here this evening. she is attending the jsm meeting within a meeting as a middle school math teacher — that noblest of all professions. my other daughter was unable to travel, and does not work in math or statistics, per se, but she does work in fashion, and while attending the college of textiles at north carolina state university, i was thrilled to discover that her dean, blanton godfrey is a statistician! and my husband is also here — who, in addition to putting up with, i mean supporting me, during these many career adventures you've just heard about —talked the unc athletic department into sharing their jumbotron image for me to use in this talk. thank you, ron, for getting me to the podium and making sure i had something to 22 talk about this evening. thank you, barry, for being such a positive role model as past asa president. congratulations to our new fellows. welcome to their family members and guests. and thanks to you all for attending this evening's event and indulging me in my stroll down leadership lane. i am proud and honored to be here as asa president and hope that some of the experiences i shared will resonate with you as you continue your own journeys. and remember, if the opportunity arises, choose to lead!

(And it's even harder when the conference thus far has been so outstanding that I have some very tough acts to follow!) I remember being impressed with some previous addresses, so, being a statistician, I sampled a few. 2000 ASA President Michael O'Fallon had many insightful remarks, but this was my favorite, the advice he received from The redoubtable philosopher and [ASA's] 93rd President, David Moore: Just remember Lincoln. At first, O'Fallon said in his address, I didn't understand. Then I recalled, within Lincoln's most famous speech given at Gettysburg, the words upon which I suspect David was trying to get me to focus: The world will little note nor long remember what we say here. Of course, that wasn't true of Lincoln, but I suspect it is true of ASA Presidents! It reminds me of advice from one of my Department Chairs, Tom Russell at CU Denver, who said, The most important thing to remember about being Chair is: Someday, you won't be Chair. I chose this year's theme, Making an Impact, because I, like (I suspect) many of you, entered the statistics profession because it deals with real problems where statistics can make a difference. These days, one hears about the glories of Data Science, and how it can change maybe even save the world, causing some to wonder whether the field of statistics is doomed. If Data Science had been around in the last century, would we have needed statisticians? Has Statistics really had an impact that Data Science could have achieved equally well, or better? I think we have some examples in our history to suggest that the role of the statisticians really made all the difference. Data Analysis is a key part of the statistician's contribution, but the analysis of data may not be the whole story. Sometimes the main contribution is defining the question or designing the experiment or data collection strategy. Roger Hoerl and Ronald Snee wrote a book on using Statistical Thinking to improve business performance.Without statistical thinking, what would the world have been like? Remember Clarence the Angel in It's a Wonderful Life? He led George Bailey around Bedford Falls and showed him the state of his town and neighbors without George Bailey. Let's step back a few decades and see what might not have been, were it not for statisticians. My first example is one that likely is familiar to many: The celebrated Polio Salk Vaccine Trial. Polio in the 1950s was a very feared disease; incidence rates almost doubled, in every region of the country, from the mid1940s to the early 1950s. (The source of these data in this graph is CDC's Public Health Reports in 1953, authored by two statisticians.) The legacy of Jonas Salk's attenuated vaccine needed to be tested. In 1954, the proposed design was to offer the vaccine to the 2nd graders, and simply follow the 1st and 3rd graders. Obviously, physicians in the study areas would know to ask 2nd graders who came into their offices if they'd received the vaccine, and the diagnosis might unconsciously be affected by this knowledge. So Paul Meier, renowned statistician then at Johns Hopkins, later University of Chicago and Columbia, was a member of the Advisory Committee convened by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. He argued forcefully that the trial needed to be both randomized and double blind, and that the controls needed to also receive an injection, a placebo injection. Only the trial designers would know which half of the 402,000 children received placebo and which half received the vaccine. This example, by the way, hits very close to home: my mother was pregnant with my brother in 1955, and hence likely she was advised not to take the vaccine. She contracted polio in the hospital where he was born in 1956. She was very lucky in that she suffered no visible manifestations of the disease, but others, like my college roommate, were not so lucky. The results of this trial were astonishingly in favor of the vaccine: The odds of getting polio were about 2.5 times higher over those that got the placebo versus the vaccine; the odds of getting paralytic polio were even higher, about 3.5. Interestingly, the results of the trial in those communities that opted to vaccinate only 2nd graders and simply follow the 1st and 3rd graders, were similar but not as strong: the odds of getting polio were about 2 for the followed unvaccinated group and 2.7 for paralytic polio. How convincing would the results have been without the influence of Paul Meier? Incidentally, Paul later was involved with the diagnosis of the cause for some stricken vaccinated children: One laboratory was improperly preparing the vaccine. Statistical Quality Control was alive and well in the 1950s, thanks to W. Edwards Deming, and it continues to be today. (And if it isn't, it should be.) Sir Ronald Fisher had advocated for randomization in agricultural trials, but that concept met with great resistance in clinical medicine. The Polio Salk Vaccine trial was inspired by the very informative randomized trial of the antibiotic steptomyocin for tuberculosis (TB) conducted in 1947 by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in the U.K. It was designed by statistician Sir Austin Bradford Hill (BCE, FRS, knighted 1961), of Doll and Hill fame, the team that conducted convincing case control studies of irrefutable associations between tobacco and lung cancer, making him somewhat less than popular with the great Sir Ronald. The TB trial initially showed benefits of streptomycin, but, six months later, also many more deaths in both arms. The cause was later shown to be a problem that we are facing today: drug resistance. Fortunately, a combination of antibiotics was found to reduce drug resistance, and a cocktail of different antibiotics is the treatment today for many conditions. It is hard to ignore the role of the statistician in both of these trials: the experimental design, the importance of randomization, and the recognition of potential biases, as well as the proper statistical analysis and comparison between the results of the two arms. Whether or not you believe in p values, you have to admit they are impressive and unambiguous, and that the outcomes of both would have been very different without Paul Meier and Bradford Hill. Another large scale public health trial took place more recently, in the 1990s. Unlike the Polio Salk vaccine trial, however, this one could not be double blind, but it was randomized. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducted one of the largest randomized trials of screening for Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer. I learned just last month how this trial came to be. In 1988, a physician at the University of Chicago contacted the late David Byar (for whom ASA's Biometrics Section Young Investigator Award is named). The physician knew Dave from their common interest in the treatment of prostate cancer. Byar was an MD urologist and became a statistician later, and served as Chief of NCI's Biometry Branch from 1980 until his passing in 1991. This physician told Dave Byar that some of his colleagues were using ultrasound to detect prostate cancer in men. Did it really work? Dave realized that the public needed a large scale randomized trial to determine whether those who had this screening really had a lower chance of dying from prostate cancer than those who did not. Obviously, you would know if you were screened or not, but those who agreed to participate in the trial were randomized into the study arm (undergo three screening tests) or the control arm (follow usual medical care). In total, screening tests were included for four cancer sites: Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovary. The trial was designed by Dave Byar and his successor as Biometry Branch Chief, statistician Philip Prorok (Prorok et al. 2000). Phil analyzed the results with his fellow statisticians. Statistical challenges arise in analyzing randomized screening trials that typically do not occur with clinical treatment trials. The results from this randomized cancer screening trial have important consequences for all adults. First, the ovarian cancer screening tests showed virtually no difference in the number of deaths with nearly the same number of women in each arm. Worse, it showed a frighteningly high false positive rate! (Imagine being told that your test for ovarian cancer was positive, only to be told after undergoing a biopsy, and possibly oophorectomy, that there was nothing wrong with you.)Prostate cancer screening via the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test also showed no differences in the numbers of prostate cancer deaths, although contamination was a big problem (many in the control arm had the PSA test as part of their usual medical care). 1The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave the CA 125 test a D rating: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer [CA 125, TVU, or both] can result in important harms, including many false positive results, which can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions in women who do not have cancer. Prostate cancer screening in the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial: mortality results after 13 years.Lung cancer screening via Chest X Rays also had almost the same numbers of deaths as the controls, although a later trial in 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial3 showed a bene.t if screened via low dose CT scan (computed tomography)4 Flexible sigmoidoscopy was the one test that did show a 25% [95% CI: (15%, 34%)] reduction in colon cancer mortality (the reductions in both incidence and mortality were greater in men than in women).5 Regrettably, of course, this is the most uncomfortable of the four screening procedures! But at least PLCO cut out two of the those cancer screening tests for you. The PLCO trial is only one of the many randomized cancer screening trials that have been designed and analyzed by statisticians over the years. A smaller trial, with about of follow up,30,000 women in each arm, was conducted by the Health Insurance Plan of New York in the 1960s to compare breast cancer screening (mammography plus clinical breast exam) with controls who followed their usual medical care. It showed 81 deaths vs 124 deaths, or about 30% fewer deaths for those who were assigned to the screened arm (Twenty years later, Canada conducted a randomized trial to assess the incremental bene.t of mammography over simple clinical breast exam, and found no difference in mortality; see Miller et al. 2000.)6 And another success, in which several ASA members from the National Cancer Institute were involved, is the use of the vaccine for human papillomavirus, which causes about 90% of cervical cancers. Four randomized colon cancer screening trials are now underway, three of which involve a colon cancer test that is related to the one used in the commercial product Cologuard which you may have seen advertised maybe you'll want to wait for the results of the trials! All trials, surveys, and experiments have unique aspects that require proper attention in their analyses. It is safe to say that, while data explorations and algorithms may call our attention to challenges in drawing inferences from the results of screening trials, such as dealing with unexpected sources of bias and variation, structured missing data, multiple subset analyses, we have plenty of job security in addressing them. And, speaking of multiple hypothesis testing, the world of inference owes much to Yoav Benjamini and his co author, Yosef Hochberg, fondly known to John Tukey as The Two Ys, for their incredibly pervasive False Discovery Rate method to account for multiplicity (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995), which has taken such a hold across the sciences that I daresay most users have no idea who developed it! The case that inspired this talk, about the critical role of statisticians and the effects they have had, came from a conversation last year with ASA senior vice president David Williamson and former ASA President Barry Nussbaum. They recalled their roles in a public health case where statistics arose in connection with a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana. Libby is a small town in northwestern Montana with a population of 2700 that grew to about 10,000 during the operation of this mine. Vermiculite is a mineral that expands when heated, so it is used in products for insulation (like in your house), as well as preproofing materials and brake linings. Before the mine closed in 1990, it supplied 80% of the country's vermiculite. There was only one problem: people who worked at or near the mine were dropping off like flies. About 400 people had died, and several thousand were suffering from respiratory diseases like mesothelioma and lung cancer. In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (where Barry Nussbaum was working) asked CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to investigate the health effects of residents in and around Libby, shortly before David Williamson joined ATSDR. David's group did its homework, which included this advertisement from the company that operated the mine: Watch it expand! and this invitation to residents to collect Free crushed rock for yard fill and children's playgrounds. They learned that the mine closed due to suspected contamination from asbestos, which would explain the high incidence of respiratory diseases. David's colleagues designed and conducted a detailed health survey to 7,307 people who had worked or played in Libby for at least 6 months, before the mine closed. The results were staggering: 18% had pleural abnormalities; the prevalence ranged from 7% for those who reported no apparent exposures to 35% for those who reported exposures via 12 or more routes. The statistical analysis confirmed that those who worked or played near the mine were twice as likely to develop respiratory disease than those who did not. A forthcoming article will be reporting on the follow up of 8,043 residents for mortality, 2000 2016, finding 16% deaths (1,429) among the residents and statistically significantly elevated lung cancer [rates] as well as for asbestosis and mesothelioma. The study and subsequent analysis are important, not just for confirming harmful effects of asbestos but also for being the first in the cleanup of Asbestos Super fund Sites.an excellent and very eloquent statistician (and a real gentleman, by the way), from Bell Labs and later at Bellcore, spoke at an ASA meeting banquet commemorating ASA's sesquicentennial year, on Looking Ahead: Cross Disciplinary Opportunities for Statistics. He listed four areas, which were quite visionary in 1990: Molecular biology and the genome project; Neural Networks; Space Technology; Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Space Technology made the list because the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Challenger was still quite fresh. On January 28, 1986, NASA launched the Challenger for its tenth flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 11.38am. Its Space Rocket Boosters were designed by engineers at NASA's contractor, Morton Thikol, which contained O rings to tightly seal the joints in these boosters. These O rings were known to the engineers to be thermally sensitive, and some limited data had shown that their pliability depended heavily on the ambient air temperature before launching. (This example also hits close to home, as my Dad and brother worked for a company that designed and manufactured some of the devices used on the Space Shuttle not the ones that failed!) Cape Canaveral was unusually cold that morning; by 11am, it was expected to rise to 31oF still below freezing. Morton Thikol engineers advised against launch because of so little data on O ring performance at such low temperatures but did not know how to quantify their uncertainties in their impressions. Now, I don't remember much from my first few courses in statistics, but I do remember this line from Brad Efron: I've often found it useful, in speaking with a client, to ask, Are there any other data? Often there are, and those other data can be very helpful. that is what happened: the O rings lost their pliability, they failed to seal the joints properly, pressurized burning gas escaped, which caused the boosters field joint attachment to separate, and total structural failure. The subsequent Rogers Commission, charged with investigating the incident, had no statistician on it, but it did have Richard Feynman, who appreciated mathematical models and statistical thinking, and the Commissioners recommended a follow up report. Ram Gnanadesikan recommended his colleague Bruce Hoadley to serve on that Committee, who found, after only the first few meetings, NASA's $15M annual budget seemed to show not the slightest evidence of a statistical scientist. The JASA article conducts a very thorough statistical analysis of the data that were available to the engineers at the time, which, while hardly numerous, even by the standards of 1986 much less today, were certainly adequate to t several models, all of which showed uncomfortably high probabilities of failure of at least 1, and possibly as many as 6, O rings at 31oF. The sad thing is that the engineers had the feeling that the O rings would not hold but they did not know how to quantify it statistically.The good news is that NASA seems to have taken the NAS report's recommendations seriously. Even with the successes of statistics in public health and medicine, biology, chemistry, physics, and social sciences, one area that was noticeably absent was Forensic Science. Some of you may have heard Hal Stern's Introductory Overview Lecture and the session this morning about collaborations with forensic scientists. In fact, only recently has statistics started transforming the field, with respect to the approaches that forensic scientists have used for decades, without statisticians, to analyze forensic evidence. To some extent, it started with this report in 2004 from the National Academies, which emphasized that the idea of comparing concentrations of seven trace elements in bullet lead found at a crime scene, with the lead found in a box of bullets found in the possession of a suspect, could be done (using a proper multivariate statistical procedure rather than the FBI's intuitive one) but only in so far as asserting that the lead in the two places may (with uncertainty) have come from the same batch of lead not from a specific box or suspect! The shortcomings in their statistical procedures were easy to see. But, more importantly, the statisticians on that report used their experience with chemometrics and on site, real life manufacturing to recognize that more than just 25 or 50 bullets would have very similar trace element concentrations to those found at the crime scene more like, depending on the caliber, tens or hundreds of thousands!The FBI had been doing this analysis for over 40 years, claiming an error rate of less than 0.04% which might have been true if the bullet lead concentrations were very, very different; more realistically, especially for the cases that came to trial that led to convictions, the false positive probability was considerably higher. I don't think either Cliff or I realized at the time just how profound an impact the statistical contributions would have, not just for the FBI's bullet lead analysis.The report called attention to the fact that the forensic analysis of bullet lead was not an outlier. It was right in line with all forensic analyses except nuclear DNA, in its lack of scientific foundations and the improper, or totally missing, characterization of false positive and false negative error rates, due in no small part to the almost total absence of statistics in the development of their procedures. The blockbuster line in that report was: With the exception of nuclear DNA analysis, however, no forensic method has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to consistently, and with a high degree of certainty, demonstrate a connection between evidence and a specific individual or source. Indeed, even fingerprint analysis falls into that category as we know from mistaken identifications. If forensic science sounds lacking in science, Eyewitness Identification needs even more help. Why? Well, first of all, we all realize that our memories are far from perfect: I am sure your spouses or significant others like to remind you of that. Despite that potential for memory infidelity, eyewitness testimony can be extremely powerful in the courtroom! When an eyewitness is called into the police department to identify a perpetrator from a line up, it's not surprising that many factors can affect the person's accuracy. Some of those factors are what we in the statistics world would call noise. For an even more heartbreaking case, see the case of Jennifer Thompson's mistaken identification of Ronald Cotton. variables that are part of the situation that cannot be controlled: lighting, distance between eyewitness and perpetrator, presence or absence of a weapon, eyewitness's level of stress at the time, etc. Other variables can be controlled, what we would call signal variables such as lineup protocol, nature of instructions to the eyewitness, etc. Yet, believe it or not, with all these factors at play, about 90% of the research in this area has looked at one and only one factor: whether the suspects were presented to the eyewitness one at a time (sequential) or all together (simultaneous)! Now, doesn't it make sense that, if you have a gun to your head, you're more likely to be focusing on that gun and not on the perpetrator, and that the effect of that gun on the accuracy of your identification probably would swamp the effect of whether you saw the suspects sequentially or simultaneously? And that is what another National Academies report said: Additional research is needed that includes designed experiments that vary many factors and use more realistic settings than Psych 101 college students watching videos in labs, and more sophisticated statistical analyses that take account of the fact that, basically, each eyewitness is a binary classifier. The Laura and John Arnold Foundation listened, and subsequently sponsored awards to conduct research to study joints effects of both signal and noise variables on eyewitness identification accuracy. If we find that certain conditions lead to high probabilities of inaccurate IDs, then law enforcement agencies and judges can be advised of the uncertainties associated with such IDs. So, statistics is having an impact in forensic science. That report appeared in 2016 and said that, basically, rather little had changed, except for one or two studies of error rates in fingerprint analysis when it looked at just one part of the process, comparing the print lifted from the crime scene with one, and only one, specific print, using examiners who knew they were being tested (hardly a blind test, much less double blind). Clearly something needed to be done. Congress appropriated funds for a Center of Excellence in Forensic Science, which would be awarded only if the proposed Center emphasized both the statistical research needed to strengthen forensic science and the bench to bedside transfer of newly developed technologies into forensic practice. It also supported a standards setting body of researchers organized into subcommittees in the forensic science disciplines, formed in 2014. Only a few of the units in this Organization of Scientific Area Committees has even a single statistician, but the point has been made: forensic practice must change, and forensic scientists would be wise to include statisticians in the development and assessment of its procedures. (This is hardly new, as medical researchers learned years ago!) All these examples remind us of these quotations from John Tukey: Finding the question is often more important than finding the answer.It is better to solve the right problem approximately than to solve the wrong problem exactly.The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data. (maybe we should start all our Data Science classes with that line?!) and this quotation from the late David Byar: A statistician working alone is a statistician making mistakes. There are so many other areas where statistics has made a real difference: Jim Filliben at NIST who studied the causes of the collapse of the World Trade Center Buildings; numerous statisticians in the federal government who design and analyze data from the Census and surveys like NHANES, Labor survey, consumer price index, and the American Community Survey; analysis of data from genomic experiments, accuracy of administrative records, and so many others. They not only have added to scientific knowledge but also have led to advances in our field that have enabled others to use these methods to make advance their own scientific fields. i don't think that the field of statistics will be subsumed by data science or by any other field. But, I do think that we need to be proactive in identifying areas where statistics can make a sea change of difference. What are those new areas, where we can use our talents, in time to make an impact? David Williamson is chairing a committee this year charged with proposing mechanisms that will direct statisticians to areas, like public health, medicine, and forensic science, where statistics can make a huge impact. Two examples right now occur to me: the work of David Banks, Sir Bernard Silverman, and others, in estimating the extent of human trafficking, and a Special Committee of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission on Election Security, to which statistician Philip Stark from Berkeley has been appointed. You can send your own examples of impact to this twitter address. We have work to do. As a statistician, I have learned much from you, and I continue to learn, as we create new ways to meet ever changing challenges. I am especially grateful for the opportunities that have led me to work with incredibly smart people, many of whom have become such good friends and have so enriched my life. I know you will continue to enrich the lives of others as you make impacts in all areas that touch our society. I look forward to the new approaches that we develop, some of which we are hearing about at this conference, and to seeing even greater impacts in the years ahead. Thank you for coming to JSM, for your work in statistics, and for making an impact in this world.
