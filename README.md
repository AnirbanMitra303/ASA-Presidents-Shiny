### ASA Presidential Speech App

This respository contains code and data for an R Shiny app that was presented during the 2020 ASA Presidential Address delivered by Wendy Martinez. This app allows users to explore 106 ASA presidential addresses between 1908 and 2019. The app allows one to explore word frequencies, topic models, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition in those speeches.

## Data

If you're not interested in the app, but would like to explore the data on your own, we also provide a CSV data file (in addition to the R RDS file in the data folder).  The file, `yom_data.csv`, is located in the main directory above. 

Enjoy!
