<p>First and foremost, I am eternally grateful for all the help my colleague <b>Brandon Kopp</b> has provided over the years. His <a href="https://brandonkopp.shinyapps.io/sotushiny/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOTU (State of the Union) Explorer app</a> inspired the one you are using now and so much more. He of course also did all of the heavy lifting creating this app, whose development was way beyond my capabilities. I just have the fun of playing with it, as do all of you.</p>

<p><b>Fritz Scheuren</b> (2005 ASA President) also provided inspiration via his collection of ASA President Speeches and more (formerly at www.asapresidentialpapers.info).</p>

<p><b>Eric Sampson</b> (ASA) downloaded the published speeches for me, which saved a lot of time. He also was instrumental in making them open-access, so others can view and play with the data.</p>

<p>This app was reviewed by <b>Samantha Tyner</b> (BLS AAAS Fellow) and <b>Donna LaLonde</b> (ASA). Iâ€™m so thankful for their friendship and insightful comments. </p>

<p>And, we cannot forget <b>all of the ASA Presidents</b> who gave us their words connecting our past to our future. </p>
